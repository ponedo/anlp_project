opinion
markey chief_judge
eastman kodak company kodak appeals from a judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of massachusetts zobel j
) holding claims of seven patents issued to polaroid corporation polaroid valid and infringed
228_uspq_305 344 d.mass.1985
we affirm the appealed portions of the judgment in all respects

i
background
polaroid sued kodak on april_26,_1976 for infringement 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 a and for actively inducing infringement 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 b of ten polaroid_patents
the complaint requested issuance of temporary and permanent injunctions treble damages costs and attorney_fees

over the next five years the parties participated in pretrial conferences filed numerous motions and engaged in extensive discovery accounting for more than one thousand entries in the district_courts certified docket.1 between october 5 1981 and february 26 1982 the district_court conducted seventy-five days of trial
on october 11 1985 the district_court issued its judgment 1 holding that kodak had failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding of invalidity of the asserted claims of seven patents ; 2 2 finding certain_claims infringed ; 3 holding claims of five patents invalid but if valid infringed ; and 4 granting a permanent injunction that would become effective on january 9 1986.3 on november 4 1985 kodak moved this court pursuant to fed.r.app.p
8 a to stay the injunction pending completion of its appeal
following briefing and oral argument on january 6 1986 this court denied that motion

kodak appeals from certain portions of the judgment that it had failed to carry its burden respecting validity of seven patents ; 4 and from the judgment that it had infringed certain_claims ; 5 and that patent_no._3753,392 is not unenforceable
polaroid has not cross-appealed the judgment that claims of five of its patents are invalid

ii
the district courts memorandum_decision
with her judgment the trial_judge issued a comprehensive 122-page memorandum_decision in which she exhaustively articulated the parties contentions including each of kodaks myriad defenses
incorporating her fact_findings and legal_conclusions she delineated the evidence and testimony introduced at trial and noted her credibility determinations
the memorandum_decision reflects the district_courts grasp of the involved technology and a correct application of the patent law to the facts found in what was at the trial stage a more complex case than even that presented on this appeal

the memorandum_decision of the trial_judge makes it unnecessary to set forth here the relationships and events involving the parties or the developmental history of the technology all of which the reader of this opinion may obtain from the reports of *1558 the memorandum_decision cited here at the outset.6

iii
issue
whether the district_court committed reversible_error in holding that kodak had failed to carry its burden in respect of the validity of certain_claims of seven polaroid_patents or in finding some of those claims infringed by kodak

iv
opinion
introduction
though it is not yet ended see note 3 supra this massive and complex litigation already spans almost a decade
polaroids amended complaint alleged infringement of forty-six claims of eleven patents
kodaks answer and counterclaims asserted multiple theories of invalidity unenforceability and non-infringment
this court granted motions for extended briefs and the appendix before us contains 18,000 pages of testimony documents and exhibits

( 1 standard of review
kodaks primary thrust on appeal as we shall see is aimed at the obvious/nonobvious issue
though it is well settled that the ultimate conclusion on obviousness is just that a legal_conclusion see fromson v. advance_offset_press inc. 755_f.2d_1549 1555 225_uspq_26 30 fed.cir.1984 that does not mean as many of kodaks arguments would imply that we may proceed on a paper record as though no trial had taken place.7 this court reviews judgments
id.at 1556 225 uspq at 31 fed.cir.1984
because we do not retry the case kodak must to prevail convince us that the judgment can not stand on the record created at trial i.e. that the judgment rests on such fundamental error as to compel reversal

the statutory question under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is whether a claimed invention would have been obvious or nonobvious at the time it was made to one of ordinary_skill in the art
that the question is` legal' does not mean that` to a judge' may be substituted for the statutory phrase` to one of ordinary_skill in the art'
thus the obvious/nonobvious question is not answerable by a judge on the sole basis of what he or she thinks` ought' to be patentable under ¡± 103
the trial_judge eschewing all personal_predilections must decide on the totality of the evidence whether the accused infringer has carried its ¡± 282 burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence facts requiring a conclusion that one of ordinary_skill would have found the claimed invention obvious at the time it was made
id.at 1096 227 uspq at 346
the appellate judge equally eschewing all personal_predilections must decide whether the trial_judges controlling fact_findings are clearly erroneous or whether on the controlling facts correctly found the trial_judges legal_conclusion can or can not stand
id.at 1096-97 227 uspq at 346-47

it is commonplace that findings other than those of the trial_judge might find some support in the record or that reviewing judges if sitting at trial might have reached such other findings
it is therefore ineffective on appeal merely to present a scenario in which the trial_judge could have gone appellants way anderson v. city of bessemer_city n.c. 470_u.s._564 105_s.ct._1504 1512 84_l.ed.2d_518_(1985)` where there are two permissible views of the evidence the fact finders choice between them can not be clearly erroneous'
the rules governing appellate_review thus require affirmance of judgments based on findings that were on the entire record made without the commission of reversible *1559 error
see american_original_corp. v. jenkins_food_corp. 774_f.2d_459 462 227_uspq_299 300 fed.cir.1985
though seven patents are involved on this appeal and we have carefully considered kodaks arguments on each one we have been shown no error that might compel us on this record to reverse the judgment or any appealed portion thereof

the burden of overcoming the district_courts factual_findings is as it should be a heavy one
in reviewing a judgment based on those findings we do not perform as robed examiners,8 nor do we repeat the role of the trial_judge in finding our own facts
see atlas powder co. v. e.i
du pont de nemours & co. 750_f.2d_1569 1573 224_uspq_409 411 fed.cir.1984

( 2 kodaks contentions
kodak says the district_courts findings and conclusions` are fatally flawed by systemic legal errors which permeate its approach to the issues of validity and infringement' supplying a list of six such errors 1 at the outset the district_court allowed preconceptions of kodaks culpability to influence its approach to the issues of validity and infringement ; 2 the district_court construed claims in a manner not consistent with the specifications and prosecution histories ; 3 the district_court in considering non-obviousness of the claims viewed the teachings of the prior_art_references in isolation rather than together
( 4 the district_court repeatedly evaluated the scope of the claims in light of the accused structure or process and in light of post-issuance self-serving statements of the inventors ; and
( 5 the district_court required anticipating art to teach what the patent in suit teaches
( 6 the district_court made numerous` erroneous' findings of fact

in proffering a total of eighteen arguments kodak variously applies items on the foregoing list to individual patents

the assertion that the trial_judge was influenced by preconceptions of kodaks culpability is unworthy of comment
that the remaining five assertions are without merit will be clear from our discussion of each of the seven patents involved in this appeal

( 3 u.s._patent_no._3362,821
claim 1 the only claim of the821_patent asserted reads 1
in a process of forming color transfer images wherein a photosensitive_element is exposed an alkaline_processing_composition is applied to said photosensitive_element to effect development thereof and imagewise diffusion transfer of a dye_image-forming substance from said photosensitive_element to an image-receiving layer in superposed relationship therewith to form a positive dye_image the improvement wherein said photosensitive_element contains a layer of a nondiffusible_polymeric_acid positioned between the support and the innermost_layer containing said dye_image-forming substance said layer containing said polymeric_acid containing sufficient acid groups to effect a reduction in the ph of the surface of said image-receiving layer of at least 2 ph units as compared with the initial ph of said alkaline precessing composition prior to completion of the inhibition period

the district_court held that kodak had not carried its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claim 1 is invalid and that polaroid had proved that kodak infringed claim 1 when it made used and sold its pr-big_token__10_film._228__big_token_uspq at 312-13

*1560 validity
first kodak says the district_court misread claim 1 as including a limitation for` timing' drawn from the specification and thus improperly distinguished the821_patent over u.s._patent_no._2584,030 to land030_patent
it says the district_court was misled by testimony respecting polaroids attempts to perfect the timing of the ph drop which` however important [ those attempts ] may have been commercially ha [ d ] little to do with what is claimed in821'
second kodak says a` staining problem' addressed in the030_patent is the same problem addressed by the821 acid_layer and its solution in030 would have rendered claim 1 of821 obvious
third kodak asserts that polaroid mischaracterized the030_patent before the examiner
and fourth kodak says the district_court improperly relied on alleged` advantages' of the821 acid_layer to support patentability
those arguments are without merit

as the district_court found the030_patent is drawn to processes for stabilizing sepia images
it is cited in the821_patent among the references disclosed to the examiner and was fully discussed in polaroids remarks during prosecution
kodaks burden in establishing invalidity is thus heavier` [ w ] hen no prior_art other than that which was considered by the pto examiner is relied on by the attacker he has the added burden of overcoming the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have done its job..' american_hoist & derrick_co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725_f.2d_1350 1359 220_uspq_763 770 fed.cir
) cert
denied 469_u.s._821 105_s.ct._95 83_l.ed.2d_41 224_uspq_520_(1984)

( a` timing' the record does not support kodaks assertion that the district_court read` limitations from the specification as well as limitations from other_claims' into claim 1
kodak points to language in the memorandum_decision discussing the invention of the821_patent with respect to the specifications disclosure of` three different timing mechanisms'
228 uspq at 311
nothing in that discussion however supports kodaks assertion that the district_court introduced a` timing' limitation into claim 1 to distinguish over the030_patent
the district_courts remarks were there directed to kodaks argument at trial that` the purpose of the [821 ] acid_layer is to neutralize the processing_composition and thereby to prevent stain caused by oxidation of the developer'
id
in that context the district_courts reference to the821 specification was entirely proper
see acs hospital systems inc. v. montefiore hospital 732_f.2d_1572 1577 221_uspq_929 932 fed.cir.1984
moreover the district_courts ¡± 103 analysis dealt specifically with the030_patent and neither contains nor relies on a` timing' limitation in claim 1

( b` staining' kodaks assertion that the invention set forth in claim 1 is directed to` staining_problems' disclosed in the030_patent is no more persuasive here than it was at trial
the district_court expressly credited testimony of polaroids dr._land and rejected kodaks contention at trial that color and sepia diffusion transfer processes pose identical problems to say as did dr. trautweiler that if one deletes the words` color' and` dye' from claim 1 one gets the process described by the030_patent does not take sufficient account of the essential differences between the processes for sepia and color
color diffusion transfer requires more time than the simpler silver transfer of sepia and color requires the removal of the alkali metal ions from the environment of the image entirely
neither these unique requirements of color nor the mechanisms disclosed in821 for meeting them are disclosed in030
228 uspq at 311

kodak simply ignores the district_courts credibility determination and the quoted findings arguing on appeal as though its` staining' contentions had been established as fact and saying the person of ordinary_skill would have known from the030_patent that polaroids developers *1561 can cause staining_problems
the argument must fail

( c mischaracterization
nothing of record supports kodaks statement that during prosecution` [ t ] he sole distinction over030 was the attorneys erroneous representation that821 differed from030 in the location of the acid_layer..' the record clearly establishes that the opposite was true
in the specification polaroid disclosed that like the030_patent the invention in the821_patent proposes to effect a neutralization of at least part of the residual alkali by employing a soluble substance of acid reaction..
there is a disclosure however in [030 ] of the use of a polymeric_acid such as cellulose_acetate hydrogen phthalate as a component of image-receiving elements effective to obtain ph reduction in silver transfer processes
the instant invention may be distinguished therefrom among other ways by the use of dye_developers the use of dyeable polymers as the image_layer and by the relatively thicker polymeric_acid_layers as compared with the image_layer
col. 14 lines 2-17

though the examiner initially rejected application claim 10 claim 1 under ¡± 103 he did not do so in view of the030_patent
that reference was cited only with respect to application claims 12 cancelled and 18 non-asserted claim 3
in respect of the latter claim the examiner said` the function of the polymeric_acid_layer in either element is discussed or is inherent in [030 ]'
in response polaroid noted that the030_patent was fully discussed in polaroids copending application serial no._2 34,864 also before the examiner which it incorporated by reference
following polaroids remarks the examiner withdrew his rejection based on the030_patent

we reject kodaks assertion that the examiner applied the030_patent only to claims` in which acid_layers are placed in both the image receiving and photosensitive_elements'
that attempt to redefine the prosecution_history is unavailing where as here the whole reference was fairly before the examiner
cf
lear siegler inc. v. aeroquip corp. 733_f.2d_881 885-86 n. 4 221_uspq_1025 1029 n. 4 fed.cir.1984

in sum kodak has fallen far short of convincing us that the district_court clearly erred in finding that` the030_patent was unquestionably before the examiner' and that` dr._land and his attorney did not in any way misrepresent its significance'
228 uspq at 312

( d advantages
kodak makes a general allegation that the district_court improperly relied on` alleged advantages' of the acid_layer of the821_patent to support patentability i.e.` luminosity'` mordant for alkali' etc
that the court mentioned those advantages does not establish that it relied on them
the courts thorough analysis renders kodaks allegation pure conjecture a conjecture totally unsupported by any record reference that would indicate such reliance
the allegation deserves no further comment

infringement
kodak attacks the district_courts finding that it infringed claim 1 on two grounds saying the district_court erred in a construing` photosensitive_element' in claim 1 ; and b finding that the pr-10_film_unit was` comprised of the same_layers' as those in the821_patent
kodaks arguments rest on its own claim construction
the district_court rejected that proffered construction and we agree

( a photosensitive element
the821 specification discloses a` photosensitive_element' comprising in figure 1 a support layer ; a layer containing a non-diffusible acid-reacting reagent ; a` spacer' layer ; and layers containing dye_developers and emulsions
the district_courts use of` photosensitive_element' is fully consistent with that disclosure
228 uspq at 312
kodaks citation of its experts testimony respecting the` ordinary meaning' of` photosensitive_element' in no manner undermines the district_courts judgment
that testimony was heard and weighed at trial
faced with` conflicting definitions ofphotosensitive *1562 element` id. the district_court having heard the witnesses chose the definition she found in the specification
kodak has shown no reason why this court should choose its definition over that chosen by the district_court
further the district_court correctly rejected kodaks argument based on later-issued polaroid_patents which allegedly used` photosensitive_element' somewhat differently
that argument is irrelevant where as here the patentees definition is sufficiently plain from the disclosure of the patent in suit as a whole
cf
fromson v. advance offset plate inc. 720_f.2d_1565 1569 219_uspq_1137 1140 fed.cir.1983

( b same layers
in attacking the district_courts correlation of layers in its pr-10_film_unit with those disclosed in the821_patent kodak says` during processing [ manufacture ] a pr-10_film_unit contains a layer of fluid processing_composition between the cover_sheet_element which contains the acid and the iir the photosensitive_element'

kodaks argument is thrice flawed
first it assumes that kodaks definition of what is and is not the` photosensitive_element' is controlling
that assumption as above indicated is ill-founded
second as the district_court correctly observed claim 1 is directed to a process involving` a layer of nondiffusible_polymeric_acid' positioned` between the support and the innermost_layer containing said dye_image-forming substance'
228 uspq at 312
the term` photosensitive_element' as found by the district_court includes kodaks acid_layer which kodak coats on the` cover_sheet_element' before assembing the film_unit and thus necessarily embraces the layer of processing_fluid
third as the district_court correctly noted apparatus distinctions not claimed are not controlling in determining infringement of process claims
amstar corp. v. envirotech corp. 730_f.2d_1476 1482 221_uspq_649 653 fed.cir
) cert
denied 469_u.s._924 105_s.ct._306 83_l.ed.2d_240_(1984)
nothing in kodaks arguments convinces us of clear_error in the district_courts finding that` regardless of the manner of manufacture' the sequence of layers during practice of the claimed process invention` is comprised of the same_layers depicted in figure 1 of the patent and has the same structure described in claim 1'
228 uspq at 312

the district_courts finding of infringement is fully supported by the record
as the district_court correctly discerned the` distinction' argued by kodak is one without a difference

( 4 u.s._patent_no._3245,789
independent claim 5 of the789_patent from which claims 6 7 8 and 9 depend sets forth 5
a process of forming a diffusion transfer image in color comprising the steps of exposing a photosensitive_element including a support carrying a silver_halide_emulsion applying to said exposed photosensitive_element an aqueous alkaline solution and developing said exposed silver_halide_emulsion in the presence of a colored silver_halide developing agent said silver_halide developing agent upon oxidation forming an oxidation_product which is substantially more mobile and more diffusible in said aquous [ sic ] alkaline solution than is said silver_halide developing agent said oxidation_product being colored and having a lower_molecular_weight than said silver_halide developing agent forming said more mobile_oxidation_product in developed areas of said exposed silver_halide_emulsion as a function of said development and preferentially transferring by diffusion said more mobile_oxidation_product to a superposed image-receiving layer to impart thereto a visible color image which is a negative transfer image

the district_court held that kodak had not carried its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 5 6 7 8 and 9 are invalid and that kodak had infringed those claims by making using and selling its pr-big_token__10_film._228__big_token_uspq at 317

validity
kodak says the process of its pr-10_film_unit is the same as that disclosed in british *1563 patent no._840731 and in three references based on inventions of k.e
whitmore and p.m. mader whitmore-mader
see 228 uspq at 315 & n. 12
it says the district_court erred in failing to hold the789_patent invalid for anticipation or obviousness based on its finding that a because whitmore-mader calls for a` subsequent_treatment with.. strong alkali' following oxidation it is a two-step rather than a one-step process ; and b whitmore-mader is of questionable_utility and commercial value because of` disadvantages'

( a` one-step' vs.` two step' kodak argues that whitmore-mader is not a two-step_process but merely requires two` sequential reactions' to release the dye i.e. an oxidation of the quinoneimide followed by hydrolysis
it says the district_court confused those` two sequential chemical reactions with a two-step manipulative addition of reagents'
( emphasis in original
thus it asserts one skilled in the art would have found it to have been obvious to practice whitmore-mader by making the alkaline processing liquid sufficiently strong so that any subsequent_treatment with a` strong alkali' would have been unnecessary i.e. that whitmore-mader either anticipated or would have suggested the` one-step' process of both the789_patent and kodaks pr-10_film

respecting the scope and content of the prior_art the district_court found that 1 the` splittable coupler process' of the british patent and the` deamination process' of whitmore-mader were` relatively slow' two-step_processes ; and 2 the oxidation and cleaving reactions of the pr-10 and789 processes take place in the alkaline_processing_composition and occur essentially simultaneously or as polaroids expert witness rogers put it` in one fell swoop' 228 uspq at 316-17 making those processes` one-step' processes
on that basis it further found that` both [ pr-10 and789 ] processes are fundamentally different from those described in the prior_art'
id.at 317

we have been shown no basis for reversing those findings which are fully supportive of the district_courts finding that no reference anticipated the claims in suit
nor have we been shown a basis for overturning its conclusion that the prior_art_references read as a whole would not have taught or suggested i.e. rendered obvious the inventions set forth in claims 5 6 7 8_and_9
id
kodaks assertions viewed in light of the undisturbed findings of record form no basis for reversal
those same_assertions were made to and were convincingly rejected by the district_court whose findings based on the testimony and evidence before it have not been shown to have been clearly erroneous

( b` disadvantages' we need not consider kodaks assertions respecting the district_courts remark 228 uspq at 317 that whitmore-maders process was of questionable_utility and had disadvantages
nothing in that remark indicates reversible_error in the district_courts findings applicable to its determination that kodak failed to meet its burden respecting validity of the789_patent
see richdel v. sunspool 714_f.2d_1573 1580 219_uspq_8 12 fed.cir.1983

infringement
kodak says the district_court erred in finding that the process of its pr-10_film_unit uses a a` colored silver_halide developing agent' cshda as set forth in claim 5 ; and b an` oxidation_product' within the meaning of that claim

( a cshda
noting that claim 5 calls for a` colored silver_halide developing agent' kodak argues that the only compound in pr-10 capable of developing silver_halide and which does in fact develop silver_halide is the b & w_developer
it says its process avoids infringement because its b & w_developer is colorless and thus is not a cshda because it does not meet the` colored' requirement of claim 5

in rejecting the same argument raised at trial the district_court said kodaks noninfringement analysis was based on` a strained and narrow' reading of the789 claims that hinged on the terminology kodak selected to describe the respective processes *1564 and because those terms were inaccurate kodaks argument failed
228 uspq at 316
we agree

in response to kodaks contention that cshdas are compounds` which can and do` develop silver_halide and which consequently must be mobile the district_court noted that claim 5 called for development of silver_halide not by but` in the presence of' a negative_dye_developer
228 uspq at 316
it found that polaroids auxiliary developer which it found the same as kodaks b & w_developer functioned as an` electron transfer agent' that moved back and forth between the layers of dye_developer and silver_halide oxidizing the former and reducing the latter
id.at 316-17
it also found that kodaks` dye_releasers' i.e
sulfonamidonaphthols were in reality another species of negative_dye_developer which did not differ in reaction from polaroids dye_developers
id.at 317

though kodak urges on appeal that we hold the district_courts construction of the term` developing agent' to have been contrary to the disclosure of the789_patent we have been shown no compelling_basis for doing so
the789 specification discloses use of a silver_halide developing agent` which is also a dye and which yields an oxidation_product which is more diffusible than the unoxidized portion thereof'
col. 2 11
50-52
that disclosure of a relatively non-diffusible cshda is consistent with the district_courts determination that` the patent does not require either explicitly or implicitly that the dye_developer be mobile before oxidation'
228 uspq at 316

statements made by polaroid during prosecution of u.s._patent_no._2983,606 of which789 was a continuation in part with respect to positive dye_developers have not on the record before us been shown sufficiently material to require a different conclusion

kodak acknowledges that789 contemplates use of an auxiliary_dye_developer but asserts that the district_courts infringement analysis improperly converted such` optional' use to an` essential' of the invention
we have been shown no compelling_basis` in light of the claim_language the other_claims the prior_art the prosecution_history and the specification' sri_international inc. v. matsushita_electric_corp. 775_f.2d_1107 1118 227_uspq_577 583 fed.cir.1985 in banc for holding the district_courts infringement finding clearly erroneous

we see no merit in kodaks assertion that the district_court` remade' the cshda element in the789 invention in light of the accused product or in view of the inventors testimony at trial

( b oxidation product
kodak first says claim 5 requires that the` oxidation_product' of the silver_halide developing agent be 1 more mobile and diffusible in the processing liquid than the unoxidized developing agent 2 colored 3 of lower_molecular_weight than the unoxidized developer and 4 preferentially transfered to the image receiver
that much is undisputed

urging reversal however kodak says its developing agent which it says is the colorless b & w_developer meets none of those criteria
kodak here plays mere word games
as above indicated the district_court found 1 that kodaks b & w_developer corresponded to polaroids auxiliary_dye_developer and 2 that what kodak called its` dye_releaser' was in fact a` developing agent' as that term is used in the789_patent
228 uspq at 317
the auxiliary_dye_developer/b & w_developer is not the oxidation_product
as the district_court noted kodaks argument falls when accurate terminology is used

alternatively accepting the district_courts finding that its` dye_releaser' was a` dye_developer' as claimed kodak asserts that a finding of non-infringement was nonetheless required because while the process of the789_patent uses an oxidation reaction to release the dye the process of its pr-10_film_unit uses` the subsequent hydrolysis'
that assumes for infringement purposes that` oxidation' and` hydrolysis' constitute two distinct steps in the negative dye transfer process
we can not credit kodaks argument
*1565 first it is undercut by kodaks validity argument made with respect to the whitmore-mader references that` oxidation' and` hydrolysis' constitute two reactions in a one-step_process
second it does not establish that the district_courts contrary_finding that` the reaction mechanisms [ of ]789 and pr-10 are the same' 228 uspq at 317 was clearly erroneous

( c miscellaneous
kodak argues that` the789_patent hardly deserves the generous interpretation the district_court gave it' saying its pr-10 process was` independently discovered and developed' and its accused product enjoys` widespread commercial acceptance'
kodak points to nothing that would establish a nexus of those allegations to the issue of infringement
mere arguments of counsel on appeal do not constitute the showing needed to undermine a district_courts factual_findings
similarly kodaks mere assertion that` the processes differ in kind' is insufficient to show clear_error in the district_courts finding 228 uspq at 317 that they are the same

( 5 u.s. patent nos._3594 165_and_3689,262
the262_patent issued as a continuation-in-part of the165_patent
because of their similarity the district_court and the parties have treated them together as will we
polaroid asserted infringement of claims 3 5 and 6 of each patent
representative claim 3 of the165_patent reads 3
a photographic_film_unit as defined in claim 1 wherein said opacifying agent is present in said processing_composition in a quantity effective upon distribution on the surface of said photosensitive_laminate to prevent exposure of said photosensitive_silver_halide_layer during processing in the presence of radiation_actinic_thereto and incident on distributed processing_composition and said opaque_layer is effective to prevent exposure of said photosensitive_silver_halide_layer during processing in the presence of radiation_actinic_thereto and incident on said opaque_layer

the district_court held that kodak had failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 3 5 and 6 of the165/big_token__'262_patent__big_token s are invalid and found that kodak had infringed those claims by making using and selling its pr-big_token__10_film._228__big_token_uspq at 321
kodak appeals from only the validity_portion of the judgment

validity
kodak says a person of ordinary_skill in the art viewing u.s
patents nos._3415,645645_patent and 3,053,659659_patent or 3,309,201201_patent would have found it to have been obvious to replace the opaque cover sheet disclosed in the645_patent with the` alternative delayed opacification means' opaque processing liquid taught in the659_patent
kodak asserts that that` obvious substitution' would have resulted in the invention of asserted claims 3 5 and 6 of165/'262

the645_patent was cited to the examiner and thoroughly considered during prosecution of the165/big_token__'262_patent__big_token s. 228 uspq at 319
see also american_hoist & derrick_co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725 f.2d at 1359 220 uspq at 770
kodaks validity challenge is virtually identical to that advanced by the examiner in rejecting claims of application serial no._815585 of which165 was a continuation-in-part hence it would not be [ sic have been ] unobvious to place the opacifier-containing processing solution between the transparent impermeable layer of land645 and thus eliminate the opaque sheet of claim 47 of land645 and at the same time replacing the opacifier-containing solution of land646 with the alkaline processing solution-permeable opaque_layer dispensed from land645 to obtain the element and processes of the instant claims since the changes involved are of optional routine nature in the art

in its response to the examiner polaroid remarked that absent the specific disclosure in its application the644645 and646 references considered singly or as a whole would not have suggested or *1566 taught the claimed invention
specifically it said [ t ] here is absolutely no suggestion in the cited references of distributing a processing_composition on the exposure_surface of a photosensitive_laminate of the claimed structure intermediate such exposure_surface structure and a separate transparent sheet element and/or the employment of a processing_composition containing opacifying agent present in such composition to prevent during processing of the film_unit photoexposure of the unit to actinic_radiation_incident on the exposure_surface of the film_unit in combination with protection of the film_units additional major surface from exposing actinic_radiation_incident on the films viewing surface by means of a preformed opaque_layer positioned intermediate the image-receiving and photosensitive silver_halide components of the unit

following reconsideration the examiner issued a notice of allowance on july_30,_1970
on october 30 1970 polaroid entered a notice of abandonment of the application but not the invention in favor of its continuation-in-part serial no._3 9,646 which issued as the165_patent

kodak resurrects the examiners rejection substituting659 and201 for644 and646 and saying incredibly that the district_court` overlooked the existence of the645_patent which teaches every element of the165/'262 invention except the opacification technique taught by659 and201'
that argument is without merit

the district_court specifically discussed the645_patent and rejected kodaks assertion that` the only difference between' the645 and165/262_patent s was the manner in which the` delayed' opaque_layer is constructed after exposure finding that` the evidence does not support the premise of identity between the645 and165/big_token__'262_patent__big_token s even before processing'
228 uspq at 319
it found that645 did not disclose the photosensitive_laminate of165/ 262 ; the manner of adhesion of the corresponding layers ; use of a single_opaque_layer to act as both light_barrier and white_background ; and use of separate preformed black and white_layers
228 uspq at 319-20

kodak contends that the district_court` erred fundamentally' in stating that` the specifications of165/262 and claims 3 5 and 6 of those patents read together clearly provide for separate preformed black and white_layers'
228 uspq at 320
kodak correctly says none of the claims provides for separate black-and-white_layers
thus reliance alone on separate black and white_layers as a claim element if that reliance occurred would have insufficiently supported the district_courts validity conclusion
the statement to which kodak refers however is but one of a number of considerations set forth by the district_court as forming the basis for its conclusion other elements identified and relied on in the district_courts analysis such as` the photosensitive_laminate' and` use of a single_opaque_layer to act as both light_barrier and white_background' find full support in the claims
id
we are not persuaded that the district_courts statement about black-and white_layers indicates that it overemphasized that element as alone sufficiently distinguishing over prior_art or that the statement otherwise compels reversal

the659 and201_patent s were thoroughly considered by the district_court
228 uspq at 320
both relate to` peel apart' film_units
the659_patent is directed to film_units used primarily for x-ray images
the district_court found that 1 the659 film_units` are not arranged and do not function in the manner of the 165/262 film_units' and do not permit the forming of the image to be viewed ; 2659 does not disclose the photosensitive_laminate of165/'262 or the opaque_layers permeable to the processing_composition ; 3 figure 10 of the659_patent does not teach the functional equivalent of an opaque flap and opaque_goo but uses an opaque envelope for processing the transparencies ; and 4 if opaque_goo were substituted for the envelope the resulting unit would be non-functional
228 uspq at 320
kodak has *1567 shown none of those findings to have been clearly erroneous

the201_patent is directed to film_units for making 35mm film transparencies
the district_court held that the disclosure in that reference of an opaque processing_composition between the positive and negative layers would not have suggested the structure of the165/'262 film_unit
228 uspq at 320
kodak has shown no error in that holding
recognizing the non-controlling nature of the fact the district_court noted that kodak in seeking its own patent on the invention disclosed in the165/big_token__'262_patent__big_token s had vigorously argued the non-applicability of the very prior_art it was extolling at trial
228 uspq at 320-21
kodak argues here that the invention was conceived by its` young and inexperienced' attorney cole and was therefore obvious
beyond the distinction between conception and invention the argument does not reflect error in the district_courts analysis as above described of the prior_art and the invention

lastly in respect of the165/big_token__'262_patent__big_token s kodak says the district_court failed to consider the prior_art as a whole but cites no support for that assertion
in framing the validity_issue under ¡± 103 228 uspq at 320 the district_court correctly said` the issue is whether in view of the cited prior_art the similarities between the subject_matter of165/'262 and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious' citing this courts decisions in thomas & betts corp. v. litton systems inc. 720_f.2d_1572 1579 220_uspq_1 6 fed.cir.1983 and kimberly-clark corp. v. johnson & johnson 745_f.2d_1437 223_uspq_603_(fed.cir.1984)
kodak points to nothing in the district_courts memorandum_decision or in the record to persuade us that the district_court departed from the requirement for consideration of the prior_art and the claimed invention as wholes when applying ¡± 103

( 6 u.s._patent_no._3578,540
polaroid alleged infringement of claims 5_and_6_(which_depend_from_claims_1_and_4) and 8 which depends from claim 7 of the540_patent
the subject_matter of claims 1_and_4_(drawn_to_''a_laminated_photographic_product_including_a_transfer_image'') is described in the district_courts opinion

a photographic_product as defined in claim 7 wherein said laminae comprising said image-containing layer are hydrophilic and contain water and said support_layers are relatively impermeable to water_vapor

the district_court held that kodak failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 5 6_and_8 are invalid and found that kodak infringed those claims by making using and selling its pr-10_film
kodak appeals from only the validity_portion of the judgment

validity
asserting that the district_court erroneously defined the invention of the540_patent as drawn to the` concept of symmetry' kodak says the district_court failed to view the claimed structure in view of the prior_art as a whole
kodak urged invalidity in view of three prior_art_references u.s._patent_no._2563,342342_patent u.s._patent_no._2983,606606_patent and its own bimat_process

( a342_patent
the district_court says kodak ignored its own findings that` one of the objects of the [342 ] patent is to obtain greater_resistance to curling' and that` it attempts to do so by the use of two support_layers made of the same material cellulose_acetate'
228 uspq at 328
it is kodak however which ignores the district_courts *1568 finding which immediately followed the quoted material that the342_patent` does not teach the feasibility of using symmetrical_water-impermeable_supports which by definition will maintain a wet environment for a period of time'
id
that finding with respect to the scope and content of the prior_art has not been shown to have been clearly erroneous

as the district found supra the342_patent claims a photographic_film_unit i.e
a structure having` greater_resistance to curling'
the specification discloses at col. 2 lines 39-53 a preferred embodiment comprising a transparent` base_layer' preferably formed from a cellulosic film base such as cellulose_acetate ; a layer of photosensitive material on the inner surface of the base_layer ; an opaque water permeable layer of` good protective colloid' forming a unit with the photosensitive_layer ; and a transparent` backing layer' which may also be formed of cellulose_acetate col. 3 lines 25-27
the photosensitive_layer is exposed through the base_layer
col. 3 lines 66-69
because the positive photographic image is` supported on the relatively non-curling base_layer' it remains flat during and after processing
col. 4 lines 71-73
the specification expressly teaches an` additional advantage' when the` relatively expensive' base_layer is used as a support for the final positive image because it` imparts desirable physical characteristics thereto'
col. 4 lines 73-75 col. 5 lines 1-3
contrary to kodaks recharacterization of the342_patent we have been shown nothing in the342 specification to undermine the district_courts finding that the342_patent did not teach the use of symmetrical water-impermeable_supports as claimed in the540_patent

that conclusion is further supported by disclosure in the342 specification that in other embodiments the transparent backing layer may be replaced with an opaque white image-carrying layer formed of a material such as baryta paper which allows two positive images to be formed col. 5 lines 4-12 or may be eliminated altogether col. 6 lines 9-15
no support-related disadvantages are attributed to those embodiments

( b606_patent
resurrecting a reference cited during prosecution kodak says the606_patent disclosed` the structure of the claimed film_unit but does not dictate the selection of any particular material as a support'
that patent was thoroughly considered by the examiner and was convincingly distinguished in the540 specification col. 2 line 36 through col. 4 line 9
see american_hoist & derrick_co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725 f.2d at 1359 220 uspq at 770
having fully considered the testimony and documents before it the district_court concluded that the606_patent` certainly does not teach the use of water-impermeable_symmetrical_supports'
228 uspq at 328
though the court also said` i do not find the concept of symmetry to have been obvious even to a person of the high skill necessary in this field' id
that statement can only be read as shorthand for` use of water-impermeable_symmetrical_supports' supra
kodaks assertion that the district_court somehow improperly disposed of the606_patent by reducing the obviousness analysis to nothing more than a search for a` concept of symmetry' is utterly unsupported by the decision or the record and deserves no further discussion

( c bimat
kodak points to its bimat_process as demonstrating knowledge in the art that film_units having polyester supports on both sides are flat and distortion-free
the district_court described the bimat_process in its memorandum_decision 228 uspq at 328 noting that after development of the transfer image the image-layer on the polyester sheet was wet and sticky and that that sheet would therefore often be covered with a second transparent polyester support to permit handling of the film-thus creating a transparency not a reflection print

with respect to the differences between the bimat reference and the claimed invention the district_court found 1 kodak never regarded bimat as a permanently *1569 closed system ; 2 the bimat laminate is made of two long strips of film not discrete film_units ; 3 the bimat` photograph' so produced will last only ten days unless the gelatin layer is washed and dried ; and 4 the bimat sandwich is filled only with hardened gelatin the transferred silver_halide and a residue of processing material thus differing fundamentally from the multiplicity of layers and retained moisture in an integral_film_unit
id.at 328
on the basis of those findings none of which kodak has shown to have been clearly erroneous the district_court properly rejected kodaks allegations of anticipation and correctly concluded that the bimat_process would not have taught use of symmetrical_water-impermeable_supports in a sealed integral_film_unit to prevent curling or distortion
id

( d secondary considerations
kodak says polaroid merely concocted a story at trial to` explain' film_unit distortion dubbed that theory an` insight' and called the` so-called solution' derived from that theory` symmetry'
see 228 uspq at 327-328
it dismisses polaroids` real world story' as meritless and irrelevant asserting that the inventor merely applied the best material available polyester to an old combination which` simple expedient' it said was taught and suggested in the prior_art
those same_assertions were made and rejected at trial
their resurrection on appeal simply disregards the district_courts contrary_finding that the invention of the540_patent involves substantially more than the choice of a known material
id.at 328

kodaks attempt to recharacterize the trial record falls far short of establishing clear_error in the district_courts conclusion respecting the validity_issue
similarly kodaks attack on polaroids trial theory is both unavailing and irrelevant the burden being on kodak to show reversible_error in the district_courts judgment
with respect to that burden we have been shown no basis for questioning the district_courts findings with respect to objective indicia of non-obviousness
228 uspq at 328-29

( e the prior art as a whole
finally kodak asserts that the district_court failed to view the references` as a whole'
we reject that contention
though the district_court never expressly said it had considered the prior_art` as a whole' kodak has shown no basis for our concluding that the district_court which as above indicated repeatedly articulated the correct standard under ¡± 103 see e.g. 228_uspq_320 veered from the proper standard

( 7 u.s._patent_no._3753,392
claim 1 of the392_patent reads 1
photographic apparatus comprising a film assemblage including
a cassette having means defining an exit in one end of said cassette through which a film_unit is adapted to be moved subsequent to exposure an opening near an opposite end of said cassette and an exposure_aperture ; a plurality of thin flexible film_units located within said cassette in stacked relation with a foremost of said film_units being adapted to be urged into a position adjacent said exposure_aperture with a first_edge of said foremost_film_unit in alignment with said_exit and a second_edge opposite said first_edge positioned adjacent said opening ; a camera including
means for receiving said cassette ; first_film-advancing means adapted to extend into said opening for engaging said foremost_film_unit at said second_edge thereof and moving said foremost_film_unit subsequent to exposure through said_exit ; second_film-advancing means including a pair of rollers adapted to receive said first_edge of said foremost_film_unit as it moves through said_exit ; motor_means ; and
means coupled to said motor_means for driving said first_film-advancing means to move said first_edge of said foremost_film_unit through said_exit and for driving said second_film-advancing means while said foremost_film_unit is *1570 in engagement therewith to rupture a container of processing liquid mounted on said foremost_film_unit and spread the contents thereof between elements of said foremost_film_unit as said foremost_film_unit is advanced toward the exterior of said camera

the district_court held that a kodak failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 1 2 3 4_and_12 are invalid b kodak infringed all but claim 12 by making using and selling ek-6_cameras and pr-10_film c kodak failed to carry its burden of establishing unenforceability
228 uspq at 335-36
kodak appeals from only the validity and enforceability portions of the judgment

validity
the district_court found that the relevant art to which the392_patent pertains is camera design
228 uspq at 333
it categorized the prior_art as 1 patents disclosing front picking mechanisms ; 2 patents disclosing rear_picking mechanisms ; and 3 a number of commercial cameras
id.at 333-34
kodak says and we disagree that the district_court failed to consider the prior_art as a whole

( a claim construction
the district_court says kodak improperly limited the element` first_film-advancing means' in claim 1 to a preferred embodiment in the392 specification i.e
a` rear_pick which is shaped like a hook' 228 uspq at 333 and permitted that` narrow' construction to dominate its analysis of the prior_art
kodak says that was contrary to ¡± 112 which requires that means-plus-function claims be construed to encompass` equivalents' citing d.m.i. inc. v. john_deere & co. 755_f.2d_1570 1573 225_uspq_236 238 fed.cir.1985
it says prior_art structures that perform the function of a` first_film advancing means' render obvious the inventions set forth in the claims of the392_patent

kodaks argument is without merit
first it is based on a truncation of the claim_language on which it rests
that language is limited to film advancing means` adapted to extend into said opening for engaging said foremost_film_unit at said second_edge thereof and moving said foremost_film_unit subsequent to exposure through said_exit'
read as it must be in the context of the entire claim that language limits the` means' to that disclosed in the patent and equivalents which engage the` second_edge' i.e
rear edge of the film_unit

second as stated in d.m.i. ¡± 112 requires` that the limitation shall be construed to cover the structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof'
755 f.2d at 1574 225 uspq at 238 emphasis in original
here as an initial matter the district_court properly construed` first_film advancing means' in light of the structure described in the specification
228 uspq at 333
it went on to note however polaroids statement to the pto during prosecution that the claims were limited to` a rear_pick that engaged the film_unit.. only at the trailingedge'
id.at 334
kodak has not shown error in the district_courts finding that in view of that prosecution_history it was compelled to read the claims as limited to a rear_pick
id
we will not` undertake the speculative inquiry' into why the limitation was entered or whether it was directed to one purpose kodak alleges i.e.` avoiding deflection of the leading end of the film_unit out of alignment with the cassettes exit slot' but not to others
cf
kinzenbaw v. john_deere & co. 741_f.2d_383 389 222_uspq_929 933 fed.cir.1984 cert
denied 470_u.s._1004 105_s.ct._1357 84_l.ed.2d_379_(1985)
thus whether applied in determining validity or infringement the broad scope argued in kodaks brief would be inappropriate

( b front-pick references
saying the district_court erred in deeming the front-pick_patents inapposite kodak wants us to hold otherwise
in view of its correct claim construction however we see no error whatever in the district_courts conclusion that the front-pick_patents either singly or in combination would neither have taught nor suggested` [ t ] hat a pick can push the film_unit and that it can do so *1571 while fully maintaining the latters physical_integrity'
228 uspq at 334

combination of references
kodak cites a pto position that two front-pick_patents no._3447,437437_patent and no._3511,152152_patent disclosed all elements of polaroids392_patent except the one found lacking by the district_court i.e. a rear-pick that can push a film_unit while maintaining its physical_integrity
228 uspq at 334
that element says kodak is disclosed in u.s. patent no 3,460,452452_patent
kodak then says the437 and152_patent s teach` advancement of a film_unit into rollers for spreading purposes' the teaching found lacking in the452_patent by the district_court
thus kodak would have us pick and choose individual elements from three prior_patents and thereby re-create the invention claimed in the392_patent
kodak does not tell us however what there is in the three prior_patents that would have suggested such picking and choosing at the time the invention was made
interconnect planning corp. v. feil 774_f.2d_1132 1143 227_uspq_543 551 fed.cir.1985

the disclosures of the452437 and152_patent s were either considered american_hoist & derrick_co. v. sowa & sons inc. 725 f.2d at 1359 220 uspq at 770 or were deemed by the district_court to have been considered by the examiner see e.i
du_pont_de_nemours v. berkley & co. inc. 620_f.2d_1247 1267 205_uspq_1 16 8th cir.1980
moreover there is much in those three prior_art_patents from the front and rear of which kodak has picked that counters the notion that they would together have rendered obvious the claimed inventions of the392_patent

the district_court found that the452_patent discloses a` scanning camera' that never was built because the structure proved too complex to be practical ; that employed a film transport totally different from that of the392_patent moving film out of the pack with a manually-operated lever mounted in the pack and not part of the camera ; that reversed the roller direction following exposure of the film then broke the pod and spread the processing_composition on the return trip ; and that did not push the film into the rollers for spreading purposes
228 uspq at 334
kodak has not shown the district_courts findings on those differences to have been clearly erroneous

the district_court found that the437 and152_patent s both` front pick' patents were` inapposite' because they operated` either on the surface of the film_unit or by entering holes in the film_unit' i.e. on the principle that the film_unit has to be pulled out of the film_unit
228 uspq at 334
the court also found that u.s
patents nos._1070,400 to brieloff and 1,626,600 to fish would neither have worked with an instant film_unit nor have suggested the invention of the392_patent
id
it concluded that` none of the prior_art_patents or cameras had to solve the practical problems' solved in the392_patent and that the invention claimed in that patent would not have been obvious
id.at 335
kodak has shown no error in the findings underlying that conclusion

in sum we have been shown nothing that might remotely indicate that kodak has carried its appellants burden of establishing error in the district_courts conclusion that nothing in the prior_art taken singly or in` combination' rendered obvious the inventions claimed in the392_patent

unenforceability
noting that polaroid had not disclosed the452_patent to the pto kodak asserts that the district_court erred in weighing the materiality of that patent
the district_court having explicated the differences listed above rejected kodaks assertion of materiality finding that the452_patent was not more pertinent than the prior_art cited to and considered by the examiner
228 uspq at 335
we have been shown no basis on which that finding and thus the district_courts determination on unenforceability could be reversed

( 8 u.s._patent_no._3753,211
at trial polaroid alleged infringement of claims 8 9 and 10 of the211_patent

claim 8 reads *1572 8
a self-developing camera comprising means for receiving a film_unit ; a housing member having film_unit exit_means ; means for exposing said film_unit ; means for distributing a processing_fluid across the exposed portion of said film_unit responsive to said film_units being progressively advanced therepast said_exit_means being positioned with respect to said fluid_distributing_means so that in the course of advancing said film_unit after exposure thereof past said fluid_distributing_means and thence through said_exit_means a first fluid treated section of said exposed film_unit is accessible exteriorly of said camera and thus exposed to ambient light while a second section of said exposed film_unit extends on the opposite side of said fluid_distributing_means from said_exit_means being yet untreated with said fluid with another section of said exposed film_unit being disposed intermediate said fluid_distributing_means and said_exit_means said_exit_means being disposed out of the path said exposed film_unit would normally follow as it emerged from said fluid_distributing_means ; and
means for deflecting said exposed film_unit from the path it would normally follow as it initially emerged from said fluid_distributing_means and guiding it towards said_exit_means

the district_court determined that a kodak failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 8_and_9 are invalid ; b claim 10 is invalid ; c kodak infringed claim 8 by making using and selling its ek-4 and ek-6_cameras ; d kodak did not infringe claim 9 ; e if claim 10 were valid it was infringed ; and f kodak failed to carry its burden of establishing unenforceability
228 uspq at 340
polaroid does not appeal from the judgment that claim 10 is invalid or that claim 9 is not infringed
kodak appeals from only those portions of the judgment dealing with claim 8

validity
arguing only anticipation kodak says claim 8 of the211_patent is anticipated by patent_no._3405,619619_patent and that the district_court erred in distinguishing the619_patent because it did not disclose` spreading' effects not claimed in the211_patent
the district_court says kodak required the prior_art to` teach' functions and alleged benefits of the claimed invention not set forth in the claims
kodak then says polaroid cancelled all claims to spreading effects during prosecution and that claim 8 must be seen as drawn only to structure

the district_court rejected kodaks anticipation argument` based on a reading of the claims of211 without any reference whatever to the specifications'
228 uspq at 337
agreeing that the specification can not be used to expand the patent grant citing united states v. adams 383_u.s._39 49 86_s.ct._708 713 15_l.ed.2d_572 148_uspq_479_(1966) the district_court stated the claims asserted here describe a structure of defined dimensions and characteristics as well as the change worked by that structure on the normal_path traveled by the film_unit out of the rollers and camera
the specifications explain the effect of the changed path of travel
without consideration of an inventions object and beneficial results the novelty of most inventions would often be elusive
accordingly i consider the prior_art not simply as it describes particular camera structures but also as those structures affect the film_unit
228 uspq at 337

that approach of the district_court in this case was eminently proper
claim 8 includes a limitation to` means for distributing a processing_fluid' in which` means for deflecting [ the ] exposed film_unit' play an important ancillary role in achieving a superior development of the photograph
understanding what is claimed by those structural` means' is possible only with reference to the specification which teaches that means which deflect the film_unit *1573 1 increase its path within the light-protected structure thereby alleviating the problem of light-piping ; and 2 cause the thinning of the layer of developer fluid and improvement in the fluid meniscus i.e.` spreading'
see 228 uspq at 337

the district_court noting that the619_patent disclosed a self-developing scanning camera and was in the class of art searched by the examiner e.i
du_pont_de_nemours v. berkley & co. inc. 620 f.2d at 1267 205 uspq at 16 found no anticipation because the` curved passage' of the619 camera was not intended to be a light-shielding mechanism and was not disclosed as so functioning ; the619_patent did not teach bending the film_unit to improve spreading of the processing_composition ; and the619_patent discloses a design for use with peel-apart film which does not present the same light-piping problems as does integral film
228 uspq at 228
those findings not having been shown to have been clearly erroneous kodaks argument that claim 8 is anticipated by the disclosure in the619_patent must fall

kodak further asserts that its accused cameras are identical to the structure disclosed in u.s._patent_no._3350,991 to murphy
if that were true there would be error for` that which infringes if later anticipates if earlier'
peters v. active manufacturing co. 129_u.s._530 537 9_s.ct._389 392 32_l.ed._738_(1889)
kodaks assertion however is based on the testimony of its expert witness kaprelian who said the film exit of kodaks cameras was in line with the films normal_path
polaroids expert testified in direct opposition to that statement of kaprelian
kaprelian was cross-examined on the point
the district_court heard and evaluated kaprelians testimony along with other testimony and the evidence and entered its findings contrary to kaprelians statement
228 uspq at 338
kodak has cited no authority and there can be none to support its suggestion that we substitute an independent de novo evaluation of kaprelians testimony for that made by the district_court
trial courts have and must continue to have the right to reject the testimony of a witness a right that can be defeated only when clear_error is shown
anderson v. city of bessemer_city 470_u.s._564 105_s.ct._1504 1511 84_l.ed.2d_518_(1985) ; the american_original_corp. v. jenkins_food_corp. 774 f.2d at 462 227 uspq at 300 fed.cir.1985
that a trial_courts opinion does not contain language expressly discrediting a witness testimony does not license an appellate court to reweigh that witnesses testimony and to make its own credibility determinations
kodaks reassertion of kaprelians statement in a vacuum is insufficient to show clear_error in the district_courts findings and does not therefore sustain its burden on appeal

infringement
citing sri_international v. matsushita_electric_corp. 775_f.2d_1107 227_uspq_577 fed.cir.1985 in banc kodak says its accused cameras escape infringement under the reverse doctrine of equivalents
it argues that the211_patent discloses achievement of a` squared_fluid_mass' through the use of cartridge projections not used in the accused cameras ; kodak found thinning of processing_fluid by bending the film undesirable and overcame the problem by increasing in the accused cameras the space between the layers in the film_unit
thus kodak says it achieves its squared_fluid_mass in a different manner-through use of a special topar pod and supports of unequal thickness

those assertions were made to the district_court which rejected them
228 uspq at 340
kodaks argument simply ignores the district_courts findings that kodaks` exit spring' is an integral part of the accused cameras and that it acted as a means of deflecting the film narrowing the exit_means and taking it out of the normal_path of the film
id

the district_court heard kodaks assertions that it knew from experiments conducted in 1970-71 of the relationship between deflection and developer layer thickness and that it had pursued its own development program
nonetheless the district_court determined on all the evidence that the accused cameras did not escape infringement
that is a finding of fact
see *1574 sri_international supra 775 f.2d at 1122-24 227 uspq at 587-88
it has not on this record been shown to have been clearly erroneous

conclusion
kodak having failed to show that the judgment portions appealed from were based on clearly erroneous findings or errors in law the appealed portions of the judgment are in all respects affirmed

affirmed

in ex parte appeals from the united states patent and trademark office pto the record evidence often consists of only the claims and references the pto board has dealt only with them and further prosecution is possible on return of the file to the pto
an appeal from a judgment of a district_court however is quite another thing a patent having issued the claims being set various additional segments of the statute being applicable a great deal of evidence being often present new facts and issues being involved and the rules of the adversarial/judicial process having come into play
