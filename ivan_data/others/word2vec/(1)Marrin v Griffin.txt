on appeal the griffins primary contention is that the trial court improperly failed to treat the` for permitting' language in the preamble as a claim_limitation
we affirm

background
in july of 1990 jeffrey and claudia_griffin conceived of the idea of using a scratch-off label to mark beverage_containers and cups so that attendees of a gathering or party could keep track of their beverage cups
the griffins filed a patent_application in april 1991 and the ¡¬448_patent entitled` scratch-off_marking_label' issued on october 13 1992
claim 1 of the patent which is representative of the four disputed claims reads as follows 1
a scratch-off label for permitting a user to write thereon without the use of a marking_implement comprising a permanent_base having a colored near_side which is normally visible to the user and having a far_side ; and
a coating of scratch-off non-transparent material having a color which contrasts with the color of the near_side of the permanent_base which coating is applied directly onto the near_side of the permanent_base with sufficient_thickness so as to obscure the color of the permanent_base and which when scratched off reveals the color of the near_side of the permanent_base
¡¬448_patent_col. 4_ll._35 -48
the first two lines of claim 1 comprise its preamble
figure 1 of the ¡¬448_patent which illustrates a beer can embodiment of the asserted invention is reproduced below

figure 1 of ¡¬448_patent
*1293. ?
michael_marrin formed a company upardi inc.` upardi' to manufacture the labels and containers with the labels with the objective of securing a license from the griffins for the ¡¬448_patent
on june_5,_2002 the griffins entered into a license agreement with upardi
the relationship between michael_marrin and the griffins broke down swiftly due primarily to differences in opinion about the appropriate payment obligations under the license
on april_11,_2006 the griffins notified michael_marrin that the license was terminated
in january 2007 michael_marrin and etch-it inc. a company michael_marrin had created to market and sell scratch-off labels filed an action for declaratory relief against the griffins in the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california seeking a determination inter alia that the griffins ¡¬448_patent was invalid
then in march 2007 the griffins filed suit against michael_marrin heidi_marrin and etch-it inc. collectively` marrin' in state_court alleging that marrin was willfully infringing the ¡¬448_patent
marrin removed the griffins action from the state_court to the california district_court and the two actions were consolidated

on cross-motions for summary_judgment the district_court ruled that the ¡¬448_patent was invalid as anticipated and therefore was not infringed by marrin

in reaching this conclusion the district_court noted that the griffins` only basis for arguing against anticipation is that the preamble_language is an additional limitation'
id. 2008_wl_4184643 at *3 2008 u.s._dist
lexis at *7
based on its finding that the` preamble_language is not limiting' the district_court concluded that` a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would find that the limitations of the body of the claims of the ¡¬448_patent are anticipated by one or more of' eight patents on scratch-off devices u.s. patent nos._4241,943` the malinovitz_patent' ; 4,637,635` the levine patent' ; 2,523,650` the dickson patent' ; 4,095,824` the bachman patent' ; 4,508,513` the donovan patent' ; 4,900,617` the smith patent' ; 4,299,637` the oberdeck patent' ; and 4,536,218` the gamho patent'
id. 2008_wl_4184643 at *3 2008 u.s._dist
lexis at *5 7
none of these eight patents was cited during the prosecution of the ¡¬448_patent

the griffins timely appealed and we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295
because this appeal is from a grant of summary_judgment we review the district_courts determination de novo and view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party here the griffins
see oddzon prods. inc. v. just toys inc. 122_f.3d_1396 1402 fed.cir.1997
anticipation is a question of fact
akzo n.v. v. u.s. int l_trade_comm n 808_f.2d_1471 1479 fed.cir.1986

discussion
the griffins main argument on appeal is that the preambles` for permitting' *1294 language should have been construed as a limitation on the scope of the claims and that the asserted prior_art therefore does not anticipate
the griffins acknowledge that the prior_art disclosed scratch-off devices
however the griffins contend that the prior_art did not disclose the ability of a user of a scratch-off device to write without the use of a marking_implement which was disclosed in the preamble to the claims of the ¡¬448_patent
the district_court ruled that the` for permitting' language in the preamble was not a claim_limitation based on its findings that 1 the preamble_language added in the amendment only added a statement of a purpose or an intended use for the invention and 2 the patentee did not demonstrate clear reliance on the preamble during prosecution to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior_art
marrin 2008_wl_4184643 at *3 2008 u.s._dist
lexis at 2008 u.s._dist
lexis at *2 7
we agree

the preamble_language indicates that the intended use of the scratch-off labels was` for permitting a user to write thereon without the use of a marking_implement'
¡¬448_patent_col. 4_ll._35 -36
but use descriptions such as this are rarely treated as claim_limitations
as we said in bicon inc. v. straumann_co.` [ p ] reamble language that merely states the purpose or intended use of an invention is generally not treated as limiting the scope of the claim'
441_f.3d_945 952 fed.cir.2006
for apparatus claims such as those in the ¡¬448_patent generally patentability` depends on the claimed structure not on the use or purpose of that structure'
catalina marketing int l v. coolsavings.com inc. 289_f.3d_801 809 fed.cir.2002
here the preamble_language only added an intended use namely that the scratch-off layer may be used for writing

clear reliance on a preamble during prosecution can distinguish a claimed invention from the prior_art and render the preamble a claim_limitation id.at 808 but there was no such reliance here
the prosecution_history establishes that the griffins did not consider the writing use for their claimed invention as being patentably significant
the griffins state that as filed the original patent_application included the following language for claim 1 1
a scratch off marking label comprising a a layer of scratch off non-transparent coating and ; b a permanent_base layer of such color so as to contrast with said scratch off_coating ; c said scratch off_coating being applied directly onto said permanent_layer of contrasting color whereby upon scratching through of said scratch off_coating reveals the contrasting color of said permanent_layer in legible lines thereby providing a writing_means whereby a person can mark on the label without the need for a writing_implement
appellants br
9 emphasis added
in revising this claim to its current form during prosecution the griffins explained to the examiner that`writing_means is not an element of applicants claims and does not appear in the new claims'
j.a
71 jeffrey a. griffin amendment after notice of allowance nov._28,_1991
because the griffins expressly attested that the` writing_means' language was not a claim_limitation they can not now assert that it was such a limitation
thus we agree with the district_court and hold that the preambles statement of purpose does not limit the scope of the claims

the dissent suggests that the presumption against reading a statement of *1295 purpose in the preamble as a claim_limitation is inapplicable because the body of the claim makes no sense without the preambles reference to a` label'
but that was also true in a number of the cases in which we held that the statement of purpose in the preamble was not a claim_limitation
in other words the mere fact that a structural term in the preamble is part of the claim does not mean that the preambles statement of purpose or other description is also part of the claim
for example in catalina marketing the preambles reference to a` system' was obviously part of the claims ; the court held that the type of system described in the preamble was not a claim_limitation
289 f.3d at 810
in intirtool ltd. v. texar_corp. the preambles reference to` hand-held punch pliers' was clearly part of the claim ; again the court held that the preambles description of a purpose for the pliers was not part of the claim
369_f.3d_1289 1296 fed.cir.2004
similarly in vaupel_textilmaschinen_kg v. meccanica_euro_italia_s.p.a. the preambles references to a` weaving machine' were obviously part of the claims whereas the preambles indication of reference points to fix the direction of movement of woven fabric from the machine was held not to be a claim_limitation
944_f.2d_870 880 fed.cir.1991

the griffins also now argue that the asserted prior_art fails to anticipate additional_limitations from the body of the claims-namely that the patented device includes a scratch-off_coating that contrasts with the color of the devices permanent_base
the law of anticipation is clear` a prior_art reference anticipates a patent claim if the reference discloses either expressly or inherently all of the limitations of the claim'
finnigan corp. v. int l_trade_comm n 180_f.3d_1354 1365 fed.cir.1999
we agree with the district_court that all of the limitations present in the claims of the ¡¬448_patent were present in the prior_art_references
in particular the malinovitz_patent taught scratch-off technologies for parking_cards
the side-by-side comparison below of the prior_art malinovitz_patent and the griffins_patent is sufficient to demonstrate that the griffins_patent does not include any limitations that were not in the malinovitz_patent

griffins patent

malinovitz parking_card patent

'' a permanent_base'

teaches a` base_card' col. 4_ll._63 that the removable coating is applied to
the base_cards surface is not removed when the coating is scratched off
( col. 3_ll._40 -41

'' a coating of scratch off non-transparent
material'

the scratch off_coating must be non-transparent since the coating` covers' dates which are only revealed when removed
( col. 3_ll._36 -41

'' having a color which contrasts with the color of the near_side of the permanent_base'

'' the friable removable coating is of a different color usually silver than the underlying color of the card..' col. 2_ll._34 -35

thus we reject the griffins argument that the asserted prior_art fails to disclose additional_limitations present in the body of the claims of the griffins_patent
beyond their anticipation arguments the griffins contend that the district_court should have ruled on the issue of infringement notwithstanding its finding that the asserted claims were invalid
this argument lacks merit
there can be no infringement of claims deemed to be invalid
ultradent prods. inc. v. life-like cosmetics inc. 127_f.3d_1065 1069-70 fed.cir.1997

*1296 accordingly we affirm the district_court judgment of invalidity and non-infringement

affirmed

no costs

newman circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent for the court has misunderstood the law of` anticipation' and has misapplied the rules of claim_construction
the law of` anticipation' requires that the same_invention was previously known and described in the prior_art
the law of` claim_construction' requires that the claims are construed in light of the specification and the prosecution_history
when the prior_art does not show the same_invention correctly construed claims are not deemed` anticipated'
it is incorrect to construe a claim so as to delete limitations stated in the claim-including the` preamble' clause-and then to hold the claim` anticipated' by subject_matter that is excluded by the limitations stated in the preamble_clause

nonetheless my colleagues on this panel delete material limitations in the claim because they appear in the preamble of the claim and then find the claim anticipated although the claim is not anticipated when the deleted limitations are considered
these deleted limitations distinguish the invention that is described and claimed in the patent in suit
it is incorrect to construe the claims contrary to the deleted limitations so as to broaden the claims into invalidity

discussion
claim 1 the broadest claim of u.s. patent no._5154,448 in suit is as follows 1
a scratch-off label for permitting a user to write thereon without the use of a marking_implement comprising a permanent_base having a colored near_side which is normally visible to the user and having a far_side ; and
a coating of scratch-off non-transparent material having a color which contrasts with the color of the near_side of the permanent_base which coating is applied directly onto the near_side of the permanent_base with sufficient_thickness so as to obscure the color of the permanent_base and which when scratched off reveals the color of the near_side of the permanent_base

precedent establishes that the preamble limits the claims when it distinguishes the use of the claimed article from the prior_art see vita-mix corp. v. basic holding inc. 581_f.3d_1317 1323-24 fed.cir.2009 as well as when it contains language that is essential to the description of the invention see in re bulloch 604_f.2d_1362 1365 ccpa 1979` the introductory claim languagestable color developer concentrate is more than a mere_statement of purpose ; and that language is essential to particularly point out the invention defined by the claims`
the preamble limits the claimed invention if it is` necessary to give life meaning and vitality to the claim'
pitney_bowes inc. v. hewlett-packard co. 182_f.3d_1298 1305 fed.cir.1999 ; see also catalina mktg int l inc. v. coolsavings.com inc. 289_f.3d_801 808 fed.cir.2002 same
our predecessor court articulated the` life meaning and vitality' standard in kropa v. robie 38_c.c.p.a._858 187_f.2d_150 152 1951 borrowing this congenial phrase from the seventh circuits decision in schram glass manufacturing co. v. homer brooke glass co. 249_f._228 232-33 7th cir.1918
this *1297 basic rule of claim_construction has never been erased and its utility in various situations has reinforced its vitality

generally stated` terms appearing in a preamble may be deemed limitations of a claim when they give meaning to the claim and properly define the invention'
in re paulsen 30_f.3d_1475 1479 fed.cir.1994 ; see also e.g. loctite corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 866 fed.cir.1985` although it appears in the preamble of the ¡¬012_patent claims the termanaerobic breathes life and meaning into the claims and hence is a necessary limitation to them`
the effect of the preamble thus varies with the way the particular invention is claimed
see pitney_bowes 182 f.3d at 1305` [ a ] claim preamble has the import that the claim as a whole suggests for it`
in applied materials inc. v. advanced semiconductor materials america inc. the court observed whether a preamble stating the purpose and context of the invention constitutes a limitation of the claimed process is determined on the facts of each case in light of the overall form of the claim and the invention as described in the specification and illuminated in the prosecution_history
98_f.3d_1563 1572-73 fed.cir.1996 ; see also e.g. bicon inc. v. straumann_co. 441_f.3d_945 952 fed.cir.2006` [ w ] hether to treat a preamble as a claim_limitation is determined on the facts of each case in light of the claim as a whole and the invention described in the patent
`` ; corning_glass_works v. sumitomo elec
u.s.a. inc. 868_f.2d_1251 1257 fed.cir.1989` the effect preamble_language should be given can be resolved only on review of the entirety of the patent to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented and intended to encompass by the claim
`` ; in re stencel 828_f.2d_751 754 fed.cir.1987` whether a preamble of intended purpose constitutes a limitation to the claims is as has long been established a matter to be determined on the facts of each case in view of the claimed invention as a whole
``

this vast body of precedent is directly contravened by todays ruling where the panel_majority discards the preamble and thereby removes limitations to the claim and then holds the changed claim invalid
the proper analysis requires construing the claims in accordance with the rules of claim_construction that is in light of the specification and the prosecution_history
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1312-24 fed.cir.2005 en banc
when this inquiry reveals that` the claim drafter chooses to use both the preamble and the body to define the subject_matter of the claimed invention the invention so defined and not some other is the one the patent protects'
bell commc'ns research inc. v. vitalink commc'ns corp. 55_f.3d_615 620 fed.cir.1995
the law of anticipation is then applied to` the invention so defined'
id

the ¡¬448_patent_specification and prosecution_history make clear that the griffins claimed invention is not` scratch-off' technology generally for other uses of` scratch-off' layers were known ; their invention is a scratch-off label on which a user can inscribe information by scratching the surface without the need for a marking_implement
the` for permitting' phrase in the preamble is the portion of the claim that makes this aspect clear
construing the claim without reference to this important narrowing distinction would encompass admitted prior_art that was considered and distinguished during examination

*1298 the ¡¬448_patent_specification discusses and distinguishes earlier applications of scratch-off technology wherein the scratch-off layer is removed to reveal information already written on the base layer
for example u.s._patent_no._4846,504 to macgregor which discloses scratch-off coupons and lottery cards is distinguished by the griffins as follows in construction the` scratch-off lottery_type_game_piece' [ of macgregor ] is somewhat similar to the scratch-off_marking_label
however the prior_art was invented to provide manufacturers with the option of providing promotional game pieces and` cents off' coupons on products
the object of scratching the label of the` scratch-off lottery_type_game_piece' in the prior_art is to expose a hidden cents-off coupon a winning game piece or some other information
these promotional labels were not invented to solve the same problem that the proposed invention for a scratch-off marking label seeks to solve
¡¬448_patent col. 1_ll._22 -33
similarly u.s._patent_no._4872,707 to debruin cited during examination describes a lottery ticket in which a` pigmented layer' can be scratched off to reveal a` printed layer'
¡¬707_patent col. 6_ll._37 -40
the griffins explained that the purpose of their invention and their manner of achieving that purpose are quite different to provide a container label which allows a simplified method you only need your fingernail for recording information and identification on the container thus obviating the need for a writing_implement
¡¬448_patent col. 1_ll._59 -62

the ¡¬448_patent_specification recognizes that the differences from prior structures are` slight' stating that the griffins label` differs slightly from an ordinary scratch-off lottery_type_game_piece' because` [ r ] ather than to scratch off the scratch-off_coating in a broad area one forms letters numbers or figures by scratching through the coating 60 to make easily visible lines 30
the user can then form a name date or some other kind of pertinent information on the label as desired'
¡¬448_patent col. 3_ll._46 -52
these stated differences from the prior_art require consideration during claim_construction yet are ignored by my colleagues
the panel_majority opinion illustrates its incorrect construction in its table maj. op.at 1295 wherein the opinion compares the ¡¬448_patents claim 1 after excision of the preamble_clause with the malinovitz` parking_card'
malinovitz adds nothing to the macgregor and debruin` lottery card' references that were cited during examination
these references were distinguished by the griffins on the ground of the limitations that are now stated in the preamble
the panel_majoritys comparison of parts of the claim with parts of references can not provide` anticipation' of the entire claimed invention.1

departing from precedent the panel_majority does not` review the entirety of the patent to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented and intended to encompass by the claim' corning_glass_works 868 f.2d at 1257 and instead engrafts a meaning on the claim that the inventors did not present and the patent office did not examine
the majoritys excision of the very portion of the claim that distinguishes the invention from the prior_art only to invalidate the claim on the basis of that prior_art is contrary to law
see *1299 vita-mix 581 f.3d at 1323-24 language in preamble is limiting where it is necessary to effectuate the patents distinction between the invention and the prior_art ; mbo labs. inc. v. becton dickinson & co. 474_f.3d_1323 1329-30 fed.cir.2007 same ; in re cruciferous sprout litig. 301_f.3d_1343 1347-48 fed.cir.2002 same

the panel_majority acknowledges its deletion of the limitations in the preamble protesting that the preamble` merely states the purpose or intended use' of the invention citing bicon 441 f.3d at 952
however the preamble in this case is more than a mere_statement of purpose or use for the specifications description of the invention and discussion of the prior_art require the features set forth in the preamble and the prosecution_record confirms the reliance on those features for patentability
the residue of claim 1 without the limitations in the preamble does not` define a structurally complete invention'
rowe v. dror 112_f.3d_473 478 fed.cir.1997
the invention claimed in the ¡¬448_patent is not completely described without the limitations in the preamble

the bicon case on which the panel_majority primarily relies states that` it is not unusual for this court to treat preamble_language as limiting' when the facts warrant
441 f.3d at 952
in bicon the court held that a` for use' preamble_phrase in a claim directed to a dental implant recited essential information and thus served to limit the claim-directly contrary to the rule the panel_majority seeks to extract from the case
bicon and extensive other authority belie the majoritys suggestion that preamble_language is only` rarely' treated as limiting
maj. op.at 1294
many decisions demonstrate that purposive language in a preamble is limiting when it serves to give` life vitality and meaning' to the claimed invention
see e.g. general elec co. v. nintendo co. 179_f.3d_1350 1361-62 fed.cir.1999 the preamble_phrase` raster scan display device' limited a method for displaying computer generated information on a screen because` [ i ] n light of the specification to read the claim indiscriminately to cover all types of display systems would be divorced from reality' ; corning_glass_works 868 f.2d at 1257 the preamble_phrase` an optical waveguide' limited claims directed to optical fibers because` [ t ] he invention is restricted to those fibers that work as waveguides as defined in the specification which is not true with respect to fibers constructed with the limitations of the [ body of the claim ] only' ; diversitech corp. v. century steps inc. 850_f.2d_675 678 fed.cir.1988 the phrase` a base for the support of equipment' was essential in giving meaning to the invention and therefore was limiting and precluded a finding of anticipation ; perkin-elmer corp. v. computervision corp. 732_f.2d_888 896 fed.cir.1984` the system of claim 1 is one of unity magnification and is image forming
those limitations appear in the preamble but are necessary to give meaning to the claim and properly define the invention
`` ; stencel 828 f.2d at 755` stencel is not inhibited from claiming his driver limited by the statement of purpose and further defined by the remaining clauses at issue when there is no suggestion in the prior_art of a driver having the claimed structure and purpose`
the` for use' preamble_phrase in bicon and analogous preamble_language in general electric corning_glass_works diversitech perkin-elmer stencel and countless other cases have been recognized as providing essential limitations to the claim
the panel_majority strays far from precedent *1300 in holding that the griffins preamble must be ignored because it states a` use' and then invalidating the claim as anticipated when freed of the limitations in the preamble

when a claim is written so that the preamble merely introduces the general subject_matter but does not state limitations of the specific invention this debate does not arise
however this general claim drafting style does not produce a` presumption' that preamble_language is irrelevant to claim scope
maj. op.at 1294-95
the cases cited by the panel_majority for this proposition do not so state
see id.at 1294-95 citing intirtool ltd. v. texar_corp. 369_f.3d_1289 1296 fed.cir.2004 ; catalina 289 f.3d at 810 ; and vaupel_textilmaschinen_kg v. meccanica_euro_italia_s.p.a. 944_f.2d_870 880 fed.cir.1991
these cases offer no` presumption' and do not disturb the authority that recognizes preamble_language as relevant when it serves to define and limit the claims
to the contrary each of these cases confirms this standard for in each case this court considered the entirety of the claim and reached a claim_construction consistent with the scope of the invention set forth in the specification
see intirtool 369 f.3d at 1296 holding that district_court had viewed preamble_language too narrowly in light of the invention that was described in the specification ; catalina 289 f.3d at 810 holding that` the claims specification and prosecution_history of the ¡¬041_patent demonstrate that the preamble_phraselocated at predesignated sites such as consumer stores is not a limitation of claim 1' for` the applicant did not rely on this phrase to define its invention nor is the phrase essential to understand limitations or terms in the claim body' ; vaupel 944 f.2d at 880 holding that certain preamble_language while limiting did not provide narrow structural limitations argued for by an accused infringer
this trio of cases does not support my colleagues new presumptive rule that the preamble and its distinguishing limitations should be ignored
these cases do not contradict the basic apothegm that where the preamble` breathes life meaning and vitality' into the claim its limitations can not be ignored

the specification of the ¡¬448_patent and its prosecution_history point unwaveringly to the role of the preamble as defining and limiting the griffins invention
my colleagues misconstrue the prosecution_record for they state that` the griffins expressly attested that thewriting_means language was not a claim_limitation'
maj. op.at 1294
the record shows that the griffins argued that no specific` writing_means' is required and that they therefore resisted specifying any particular writing instrument ; but they did not thereby remove the purpose of providing a scratch-off label that accepts writing without a particular marking instrument and without preprinted information underneath
the specification stresses that the goal of the invention is to provide a label that can be written on by scratching the surface-as the griffins explained to the examiner the label can be marked by a fingernail coin or whatever else is handy and the claim states that no specific` marking_implement' is required
the claim was allowed with this phrase in the last claim clause and no objection was made by the examiner when the griffins moved this phrase to the front of the claim
neither the griffins nor the examiner suggested that this movement eliminated this fundamental aspect of the invention
whatever the intent of the griffins prosecuting their patent_application pro se there is no support whatsoever for the *1301 panel_majoritys conclusion that they` expressly attested' that they were deleting the heart of their invention from their claims after allowance

the courts holding today distorts long-standing rules of claim interpretation by requiring that distinctions between the invention and the prior_art must be ignored when they are presented in the introductory clause of the claim
the majoritys claim_construction and the ruling of anticipation based on elimination of the limitations in the preamble of the ¡¬448_patent claims are contrary to law and precedent
i respectfully dissent
