background
this case concerns pharmaceutical formulations and dosing regimens for combined oral_contraceptive` coc' products
first introduced in 1960 cocs better known as birth control pills deliver synthetic hormones that regulate the natural_ovarian_cycle and prevent pregnancy
specifically cocs comprise a progestin and an estrogen that together inhibit folliculogenesis-a stepwise hormone-directed process in which an ovarian follicle containing an immature oocyte i.e. an egg cell grows and develops for approximately the first two weeks of an ovarian cycle culminating in the release of a fertile oocyte at ovulation
the synthetic_progestin and estrogen provided in a coc suppress production of the natural hormones that drive folliculogenesis thus inhibiting ovulation and reducing the incidence of pregnancy in coc_users
the contraceptive effects depend on the continued presence of the inhibitory synthetic hormones ; folliculogenesis will commence if the synthetic_progestin and estrogen are withdrawn but can be abrogated if the hormones are reintroduced before ovulation occurs

to maintain synthetic hormone concentrations sufficient for sustained follicular suppression cocs are typically taken once daily and since their introduction most_cocs have been provided in 28-day 28-pill packs that align with the approximate length of a natural_ovarian_cycle
early cocs relied on a 21/7 dosing regimen in which each monthly pill pack would include twenty-one active_pills containing synthetic_progestin and estrogen followed by seven placebo_pills containing no hormones
the seven-day placebo period also known as the pill-free_interval was originally included because it i triggered a` withdrawal_bleed' that mimicked natural menstrual bleeding and was presumed to improve acceptance among coc_users and ii provided a regular break from synthetic_hormone_exposure that was thought to mitigate potential side effects
the 21/7 regimen persists in most_cocs on the market today

in addition to maintaining a pill-free_interval another strategy to reduce side effects has been to reduce the hormone_dose provided in each pill
for example the first cocs provided relatively high daily doses of synthetic estrogen up to approximately 150 £gg per active_pill
deleterious side effects of coc_use including thromboembolism nausea and bloating have been most strongly associated with synthetic estrogen exposure so the estrogen dose in particular has been progressively reduced over time
the first coc containing the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol` ee' at only 20 £gg per pill was approved for sale in the united_states in 1976

in the early 1990s bayer began developing a low-dose coc containing 20 £gg_ee and the synthetic_progestin drospirenone` drsp' to be administered with a reduced pill-free_interval
lowering ee dosage to 20 £gg per pill limits undesirable side effects but it also results in weaker ovarian suppression compared to higher-dose_cocs
as such some ovarian activity and follicular maturation can persist in users of low-dose_cocs and any intake errors i.e. missed pills especially those that effectively lengthen the unregulated pill-free_interval could result in` escape' ovulation and unintended_pregnancy
¡¬ 564 patent col. 2_l._38 -col. 3_l._6
to address the risk of escape_ovulation for users of low-dose_cocs bayer implemented 23/big_token__5_and_24__big_token /4 dosing regimens reducing the pill-free_interval to five or four days respectively *1372 and increasing the number of active_pills per cycle accordingly
bayer demonstrated that shortening the pill-free_interval to four or five days improved the contraceptive efficacy of low-dose coc formulations
accordingly bayer filed its first patent application directed to such low-dose extended-regimen cocs on december 22 1993 and that application eventually led to the ¡¬564_patent1 the ¡¬564_patent includes 15 claims reciting various coc_preparations ; claims 13_and_15 read as follows

13
a combination product for oral contraception comprising
( a 23_or_24 daily dosage_units each containing 0.020 mg of ethinylestradiol and 2.big_token__5_to_3__big_token0 mg of drospirenone and
( b 5_or_4 respectively active ingredient-free placebo_pills or other_indications to show that the daily administration of the 23_or_24 dosage_units respectively is to be followed by 5_or_4 respectively pill-free or placebo pill days wherein each of the dosage_units containing drospirenone contains the same amount of drospirenone
... 15
a combination preparation of claim 13 which comprises 24 dosage_units and 4 placebo_pills or other_indications to show that no dosage unit or placebo pill is administered during the last 4 days of the menstrual cycle
¡¬564_patent_col. 6_l._57 -col. 8_l._4
bayer markets a coc_product that embodies claims 13_and_15 under the brand name yazthe_r
that product includes four placebo_pills and twenty-four active_pills each containing 20 £gg_ee and 3 mg_drsp
bayer received final approval to market yazthe_r in the united_states on march_16,_2006
the defendants filed abbreviated new drug applications` andas' with the u.s. food and drug administration` fda' seeking approval to market generic versions of yazthe_r
those anda_filings included paragraph iv certifications asserting that the ¡¬564_patent is invalid
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv 2006
bayer responded by bringing patent infringement actions alleging that the defendants anda_filings infringed claims 13_and_15 of the ¡¬564_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 22

before the district_court the defendants conceded that their andas infringed the ¡¬564_patent under ¡± 271 e 2

the sole issue before us is whether the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment in favor of bayer and holding that asserted claims 13_and_15 of the ¡¬564_patent are not invalid for obviousness in light of the presented prior_art

the defendants rely on six prior_art_references australian patent application 55094/90 published november 22 1990` au¡¬094' ; european patent application publication 0_253_607 published april_29,_1992` ep¡¬607' ; b.g

according to the defendants the combination of au¡¬094 with any of ep¡¬607 molloy guillebaud landgren or goldstuck would have rendered the asserted claims of the ¡¬564_patent obvious at the time of invention
in particular the defendants argue that au¡¬094 discloses a coc combining 20-40 £gg_ee and 1-10 mg_drsp per active_pill-dosage ranges that encompass those recited in claims 13_and_15 of the ¡¬ 564 patent
the defendants further contend that ep¡¬607 molloy guillebaud landgren and goldstuck each disclose 23/5 and/or 24/4 dosing regimens and that those references provided motivation to combine such regimens with the low-dose_cocs disclosed in au¡¬094 by identifying the problem of missed-pill conceptions and suggesting a shortened pill-free_interval as a solution
finally the defendants contend that the district_court erred by misapplying and misinterpreting the cited references and by crediting legally insufficient evidence as secondary_indicia of nonobviousness

in response bayer argues that au¡¬094 and ep¡¬607 were directed to narrow subpopulations of patients primarily in need of hormone-replacement_therapy so those references would not have been combined by a person of ordinary_skill seeking to develop a coc in 1993
furthermore according to bayer the prior_art as a whole taught away from the claimed coc_preparations at that time in view of the entrenched use of traditional 21/7 dosing and the perceived risks from increasing total synthetic hormone administration by shortening the pill-free_interval
finally bayer defends the district_courts reliance on its evidence of unexpected_results expert_skepticism industry_praise and copying as secondary_indicia of nonobviousness

we agree with the defendants that the district_court erred in holding the claims not invalid
a claim is invalid for obviousness` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 2006
in this case the cited prior_art_references set forth every limitation required by the asserted claims and provide express motivation to combine those teachings to derive the claimed coc_products
accordingly the asserted claims are invalid under ¡± 103

there is no dispute that claims 13_and_15 of the ¡¬564_patent require a coc_product defined by the following limitations 1 20 £gg_ee per active_pill 2 2.5-3.0 mg_drsp per active_pill and 3 a 23/big_token__5_or_24__big_token /4 dosing regimen
¡¬564_patent_col. 6_l._57 -col. 8_l._4
nor is it disputed that the cited prior_art_references disclose each of those limitations
for example ep¡¬607 discloses a combination_dosage_form that can provide hormonal replacement_therapy and contraceptive protection using a` preferred administration cycle [ of ] 24 days of the combination_dosage_form and 4 days of no dosage form'
ep¡¬big_token__607_col._1__big_token ll
3-18 ; see also id
col. 3_ll._46 -57 describing 24/big_token__4_and_23__big_token /5 dosage regimens as` preferred'
in addition the disclosed active dosage form includes an estrogen and a progestin ; ep¡¬607 lists ee 8-30 £gg per dose among three estrogen choices and describes several suitable progestins but drsp is not disclosed
id
col. 2_l._35 -col. 3_l._25
au¡¬094 however discloses drsp as an additional progestin suitable for use` alone or in combination with estrogens in contraceptive preparations'
au¡¬big_token__094_at_1__big_token
furthermore au¡¬094 indicates that ee is a *1375 preferred estrogen complement to drsp for coc_use and suggests using daily doses of 20-40 £gg_ee with 1-10 mg_drsp
id.at 4-5
au¡¬094 even refers expressly to ep¡¬ 607 stating that the disclosed ee/drsp preparations can be used` analogously' to the ep¡¬607 combinations and expressly incorporating the disclosure of ep¡¬607 by reference
id.at 5-6
in sum ep¡¬607 and au¡¬094 disclose all three limitations required by the asserted claims
au¡¬094 discloses coc_preparations that encompass the claimed doses of ee and drsp and ep¡¬607 discloses similar cocs also comprising the claimed dose of ee administered via the claimed 24/big_token__4_and_23__big_token /5 regimens

with every limitation of the asserted claims thus disclosed in the cited references the question as the district_court recognized becomes whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to combine those teachings to derive the claimed subject_matter with a reasonable expectation of success
see e.g. unigene labs. inc. v. apotex inc. 655_f.3d_1352 1360 fed.cir.2011` obviousness requires more than a mere showing that the prior_art includes separate references covering each separate limitation in a claim under examination
rather obviousness requires the additional showing that a person of ordinary_skill at the time of the invention would have selected and combined those prior_art elements..' citing ksr 550 u.s. at 418 421 127_s.ct._1727 ; see also watson_summary_judgment_order 2012_wl_1079551 at *18` what was not known based on the prior_art was the desirability of using the claimed drospirenone and ee doses together with the claimed monthly regimen
``

the prior_art before us provides that motivation
in addition to au¡¬094s express reference to ep¡¬607 several of the cited references highlight evidence that the unregulated ovarian activity that occurs during a seven-day pill-free_interval can achieve significant_follicular_development and those references also express concern that inadvertently extending the traditional pill-free_interval via one or more missed pills could lead to escape_ovulation and unintended_pregnancy
see e.g. molloy at 1475` the demonstration of ovarian folliculogenesis.. on the seventh pill free day means that during the early days of the subsequent pill cycle some women harbour significantly developed follicles ready to [ ovulate ] if oestrogen suppression were to fail because of a missed pill
`` ; guillebaud at 35 stating` that it is precisely because of this seven day break that most pregnancies occur and that the pill omissions of greatest concern are those that lead to a lengthening of the pill-free_interval' quotation omitted ; landgren at 444` these data seem to suggest that ovulation is more likely to occur when the pill is omitted during the first days of the artificial cycle
hence the prolongation of the pill-free_week by two or more days is likely to increase the risk ofescape ovulation`
in addition bayers expert acknowledged that one of skill in the art at the time of the invention would have expected an even greater risk of such` missed pill' ovulation for users of low-dose_cocs i.e. those containing 20 £gg_ee per active_pill
j.a.2032-35

the evidence thus demonstrates that missed-pill ovulation was a recognized concern with traditional 21/7 cocs particularly for those on the market by 1993 that-like the claimed coc_preparations-relied on low-dose ee
as the supreme court has stated` any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed'
ksr 550 u.s. at 420 127_s.ct._1727
furthermore the references in this case go beyond *1376 just illuminating a known problem ; they also expressly propose the claimed solution` to reduce the risk of missed pill conception a 28 day_pack containing 23 pills and 5 blanks could be substituted for the current 21 day_pack
this would still permit a withdrawal_bleed without the risk of significant_follicular_development'
molloy at 1475 ; see also goldstuck at 338` the suggestion [ for 24/4 dosing ] is of considerable_merit
this would both maintain a 28-day regimen and help reduce the pill-free_interval in those women who inadvertently miss a pill
`` ; guillebaud at 43` [ i ] t is preferable to shorten the pill-free_interval usually to four days in women where there is a suspicion of an increased risk of breakthrough ovulation`
accordingly the prior_arts direct recommendations to use 24/big_token__4_and_23__big_token /5 dosing regimens to minimize the risks of escape_ovulation would have motivated one of ordinary_skill in the art to implement such a shortened pill-free_interval for use with known low-dose_cocs as recited in the asserted claims

bayers arguments do not support a contrary conclusion
bayer contends that ep¡¬607 and au¡¬094` are primarily directed to older women who have reached premenopause and are in need of hormone replacement_therapy' and that therefore a` skilled person setting out to design an oral_contraceptive using ee and drsp would not have used the 24/4 regimen intended to achieve effective [ hormone-replacement_therapy ]'
appellees br
39-40
but those references plainly disclose preparations with hormone replacement and contraceptive applications and the product claims at issue do not distinguish between target patient populations whether by age or otherwise

in addition bayer argues that the prior_art taught away from the claimed coc_preparations focusing on statements in guillebaud as indicating that the` conventional wisdom' in the field favored 21/7 dosing for most patients and as suggesting that a reduced pill-free_interval should be used together with higher-dose_cocs for patients perceived to be at risk of escape_ovulation.4 those statements however do not overcome the express teachings of multiple references including guillebaud that a shorter_pill-free_interval would improve coc efficacy
furthermore guillebaud may have suggested condensing the pill-free_interval while concurrently increasing the hormone_dose for at-risk patients but those two measures are never described as mutually dependent and each could be expected to reduce missed-pill ovulation risks with or without the other
`` [ a ] finding that the prior_art as a whole suggests the desirability of a particular combination need not be supported by a finding that the prior_art suggests that the combination claimed.. is the preferred or most desirable combination'
in re fulton 391_f.3d_1195 1200 fed.cir.2004
just because one of several references indicated a preference for using 24/big_token__4_or_23__big_token /5 dosing regimens in tandem with higher-dose_cocs does not mean the same missed-pill rationale could not also motivate applying the shorter_pill-free_interval to similarly improve other coc_preparations

*1377 finally bayers evidence of secondary_indicia of nonobviousness including alleged unexpected_results expert_skepticism industry_praise and copying by others is legally insufficient
to demonstrate unexpected_results bayer relies on data showing that 23/5 administration results in reduced follicular activity compared to 21/7 dosing of the same coc formulation
but those data merely confirm that administering additional active_pills results in additional follicular suppression which would have been a matter of` common sense' as even bayers expert agreed

as evidence of expert_skepticism bayer cites an fda request for clinical safety data and data demonstrating efficacy benefits sufficient to justify the added synthetic_hormone_exposure required for the proposed 24/4 dosing regimen
that request in no way indicates that fda experts would have been surprised to receive such data
see dow jones & co. v. ablaise ltd. 606_f.3d_1338 1352 fed.cir.2010 rejecting proffered evidence of expert_skepticism that` d [ id ] not directly address whether there was actual skepticism concerning the invention'
rather the cited request reflects attention to the fdas normal duties ensuring the safety and efficacy of new drugs by requiring actual data to corroborate statements in a new drug application

next bayer claims that its invention` was widely praised by experts in the coc field'
appellees br
61
in making that claim bayer relies on journal citations that reference the findings stated in bayers published efficacy studies or discuss possible non-contraceptive indications for 24/4 coc regimens
another article describing bayers 24/4 coc regimen as an` innovative strategy' was authored by the first-named inventor of the ¡¬564_patent
such bare journal citations and self-referential commendation fall well short of demonstrating true industry_praise
furthermore industry_praise of what was clearly rendered obvious by published references is not a persuasive secondary consideration

lastly we reject bayers contention that copying of its coc_preparations by the defendants and other generic manufacturers supports its validity position
such evidence of copying in the anda context is not probative of nonobviousness because a showing of bioequivalence is required for fda approval

conclusion
we have considered bayers remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive
accordingly nothing bayer has presented overcomes the plain disclosures and express motivation to combine those disclosures in the prior_art
we therefore conclude that claims 13_and_15 of the ¡¬564_patent are invalid for obviousness in view of the cited references and we reverse the judgment of the district_court

bayer also contends that goldstuck` endorsed' guillebauds suggestion to use a higher-dose formulation with a 24/big_token__4_or_23__big_token /5 regimen and therefore teaches away on the same basis

in citing guillebaud however goldstuck makes no mention of hormone_dose` the suggestion that manufacturers make 28-day_packages consisting of 24 active tablets and 4 bran [ placebo ] tablets is of considerable_merit [ guillebaud ]
this would both maintain a 28-day regimen and help reduce the pill-free_interval in those women who inadvertently miss a pill'
