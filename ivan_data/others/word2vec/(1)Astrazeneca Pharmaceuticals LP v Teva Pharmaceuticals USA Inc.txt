newman circuit_judge
teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc. teva_pharmaceutical_industries ltd. and sandoz inc. appeal from the grant by the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey of astrazeneca_pharmaceuticals_lp and astrazeneca uk limiteds motion for summary_judgment of no inequitable_conduct.1 the district_court ruled that the appellants had not presented evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that in prosecution of the subject patent_application in the patent and trademark office` pto' astrazeneca made a misrepresentation of material_fact or an omission of material_fact with intent to deceive or mislead the patent_examiner into granting the patent
we affirm the district_courts ruling

background
astrazeneca is the assignee of united states patent no._4879,288` the ¡¬ 288 patent' which claims the antipsychotic_drug_quetiapine having the following structural formula

?
astrazeneca markets quetiapine under the brand name` seroquelthe_r'
the ¡¬ 288 patent explains that this product is an` atypical' antipsychotic drug which means that unlike` typical' antipsychotics it does not produce involuntary body movements including torsion spasms muscle spasms and dystonia of the face neck or back with protrusion of the tongue and tonic spasms of the limbs dyskinesias
such undesirable side effects were not unusual for antipsychotic drugs
an earlier atypical_antipsychotic drug clozapine had become available in the 1970s but it was withdrawn from the market after it was discovered to cause a potentially deadly reduction in white blood cell count known as agranulocytosis
the astrazeneca product quetiapine was approved by the fda in 1997
the ¡¬288_patent expires on september 26 2011

teva and sandoz each filed abbreviated new drug applications` andas' for approval to sell their production of quetiapine under 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j certifying under` paragraph iv' that the ¡¬288_patent is invalid and/or not infringed
paragraph iv certifications are by statute an act of technical patent infringement designed to permit litigation of patent issues for products subject to federal regulatory approval
35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a
in accordance with the statutory procedures astrazeneca filed infringement suits against teva and sandoz ; the suits were consolidated in *770 the district court for the district of new_jersey
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 5 b iii

the district_court granted summary_judgment that there was no inequitable_conduct in prosecution of the ¡¬288_patent_application
that is the only issue of this appeal

discussion
the grant of summary_judgment receives plenary review on appeal
innogenetics n.v. v. abbott labs. 512_f.3d_1363 1378 fed.cir.2008
`` although the premises of inequitable_conduct require findings based on all the evidence a procedure that may preclude summary determination a motion for summary_judgment may be granted when drawing all reasonable_factual_inferences in favor of the non-movant the evidence is such that the non-movant can not prevail'
atd corp. v. lydall inc. 159_f.3d_534 547 fed.cir.1998 citation omitted
on appellate review we accordingly consider the evidence and all reasonable_factual_inferences in light of the applicable_law and the burdens and standards of proof
id.at 540

the issue presented in this case relates to the extent to which the patent applicant having fully disclosed the relevant prior_art and having provided comparative_data to the satisfaction of the patent_examiner must also present any additional unpublished information in the applicants possession concerning other less structurally similar_compounds and must also synthesize additional compounds for comparative testing
the district_court reviewed the evidence in the dual contexts of the materiality of any withheld or omitted information and whether deceptive_intent had been established
these are the essential factual underpinnings of the charge of inequitable_conduct and both materiality and deceptive_intent must be established by clear and convincing_evidence
see kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 872 fed.cir.1988 en banc both materiality and deceptive_intent must be shown
intent to deceive can not be inferred from a high_degree of materiality alone but must be separately proved to establish unenforceability due to inequitable_conduct
id.at 876 ; see star_scientific inc. v. r.j. reynolds tobacco co. 537_f.3d_1357 1366 fed.cir.2008` [ t ] he fact that information later found material was not disclosed can not by itself satisfy the deceptive_intent element of inequitable_conduct
``

if both materiality and deceptive_intent are established the court shall balance these findings with cognizance of the underlying facts and determine whether in the specific case there was inequitable_conduct in the prosecution of the patent_application
star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1365
upon determining that there was inequitable_conduct in obtaining the patent the district_court may in its discretion declare the patent permanently unenforceable
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876

the prior art
the references on which the appellants base their argument of withholding comparative_data were all before the pto
after filing of the ¡¬288_patent_application before the examiners first_office_action astrazeneca filed an information disclosure statement` ids' listing several_references including those described below and stated` enclosed herewith.. is a list of references believed to be relevant to the subject matter of the invention [ ]'
the relevant compounds in these references are compound 21076 described in the german-language publication research disclosure 1980` research disclosure' ; compound 24028 described in u.s._patent_no._3539,573 to schmutz et al
(` schmutz *771 ii' ; perlapine described in u.s._patent_no._3389,139 to schmutz et al
(` schmutz i' ; and fluperlapine described in u.s._patent_no._4308,207 to hunziker et al
(` hunziker'
these four compounds have the structural formulae shown below

?
astrazeneca had internal_test_data for these four compounds as well as for many other compounds ; data that were generated in the course of the research leading to quetiapine
this internal information was not included in its ids-that is the main basis of the appellants inequitable_conduct argument for they argue that astrazenecas data showed that some prior_art_compounds potentially exhibited atypical_antipsychotic activity and that this information should have been reported to the patent_examiner
the examiner in the first_office_action cited several_references showing compounds of close structural_similarity to quetiapine
the examiner cited schmutz_ii as the primary reference in view of u.s._patent_no._4097,597 to horrom` horrom' which was another reference included in astrazenecas ids and other combinations of secondary references
in particular the examiner identified a compound described in schmutz_ii to which the parties refer as` schmutz_x' and a compound described in horrom
these structures are as follows

?
*772 during the prosecution the applicant and the examiner discussed the prior_art_compounds for it was not disputed that the structural differences were small among these various compounds
the examiner based the rejection on structural_similarity alone and the applicant in response pressed the unpredictability of the critical physiological property of atypicality and that the prior_art provided no reason to make the particular compound quetiapine for the purpose of obtaining atypical_antipsychotic_properties
astrazeneca pointed to the long-felt need for such a drug because the use of clozapine was severely limited and no suitable replacement was available in the united states

the examiner persisted in the rejection stating that in accordance with the law of obviousness as to the claimed structure it is not necessary that the prior_art described or suggested that a specific structure would impart a specific property if in fact the prior_art_product had the desired property
the examiner stated that in order to overcome the structural obviousness rejection astrazeneca must provide proof that the prior_art_compounds do not necessarily or inherently possess the characteristics of the claimed product..
in other words once a condition of prima facie structural obviousness has been made out it must be overcome by a side-to-side comparison with the closest art compound s
in this case one would test both the prior_art species [ horrom_compound ] and [ schmutz_x ] and the claimed specie for their ability to avoid e.g
tardive dyskinesia or whatever undesirable side effect applicant wishes to focus on
pto paper no._10 december 2 1988
the examiner referred to the ids and stated [ t ] he cited references are noted
none disclose [ sic ] compounds closer than the species already discussed
id

in response to the examiners position astrazeneca submitted the declaration of one of the inventors dr._migler with data for the horrom_compound and a schmutz compound
the prosecuting attorney explained that astrazeneca did not have psychotic_test_data for schmutz_x and that such data would be` very expensive to generate now' and as a substitute astrazeneca offered pre-existing internal data for schmutz_b which the inventors believed was closer structurally than schmutz_x because the hydroxyethyl side-chain of schmutz_b is more similar to quetiapines side-chain than is the ethyl side-chain of schmutz_x
these structures are

?
dr._miglers declaration contained psychotic_test_data showing that the horrom_compounds antipsychotic_properties were` typical'
the declaration also contained *773 psychotic_test_data for schmutz_b and showed that it too was` typical'
dr._migler also included test_data for another compound described in schmutz_ii that the parties call schmutz_a which differs from quetiapine in that schmutz_as left benzene ring is substituted with chlorine whereas quetiapines left ring is unsubstituted and schmutz_as side chain is methyl as compared to quetiapines hydroxyethoxyethyl
the test_data showed that schmutz_a was inactive for antipsychotic activity ; astrazeneca explained that in light of this inactivity no test for atypical side-effects was conducted for schmutz_a

the appellants inequitable_conduct arguments before the district_court and again before this court focus on the fact that astrazeneca did not submit to the pto its internal_test_data for perlapine fluperlapine compound 21076 and compound 24028 shown supra
the appellants_state that it was a material_withholding to provide test_data only for the compounds on which the examiner relied stating that astrazenecas internal_test_data showed that compounds other than quetiapine possessed potential atypical_antipsychotic activity
thus the appellants argued that the migler declaration was deliberately misleading

the district_court found that astrazeneca properly addressed the closest_prior_art in response to the examiners specific requests and that the premises of the factual allegations of material_withholding with deceptive_intent had not been shown sufficiently to avoid the grant of summary_judgment citing that inequitable_conduct in patent_prosecution requires proof by clear and convincing_evidence of both 1 an affirmative misrepresentation of material_fact a failure to disclose material_information or submission of false material_information and 2 an intent to deceive the examiner by such material falsity
astrazeneca 567 f.supp.2d at 691 citing cargill inc. v. canbra foods ltd. 476_f.3d_1359 1364 fed.cir.2007

materiality
several standards for establishing the fact of materiality in connection with patent_prosecution have been proposed
see e.g. litton indus products inc. v. solid state systems corp. 755_f.2d_158 166_n._19_(fed.cir.1985) identifying` four tests 1 objectivebut for ; 2 subjectivebut for ; 3but it may have been ; 4 pto rule 1.56 a i.e. whether there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would have considered the omitted reference or false information important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent'
while a uniform standard has not been rigorously applied in the courts the fourth test of whether a reasonable_examiner would have considered the information important in deciding whether to grant the patent even when the omitted information does not negate patentability is most often employed
see e.g. upjohn co. v. mova pharm corp. 225_f.3d_1306 1312 fed.cir.2000
`` however a reference need not be provided to the examiner if it is merely cumulative to or less material than other references before the examiner'
id

appellants contend that astrazeneca misrepresented that the atypical_properties of quetiapine were unexpected stating that astrazeneca presented internal_test_data about similar_compounds that were typical while omitting internal_test_data about similar_compounds that were potentially atypical
astrazeneca states that it properly focused on the prior_art_compounds that were structurally closest to quetiapine and that its internal_test_data show that these closest_compounds were not atypical
astrazeneca states that this is the comparison requested by the examiner and the comparison most directly in *774 line with the applicable_law
astrazeneca states that it never represented to the examiner that quetiapines atypical_properties made it completely unique among structurally similar_compounds and points out that in its ids astrazeneca identified the references describing the compounds that the appellants here assert are potentially atypical_antipsychotics i.e. perlapine fluperlapine compound 24028 and compound 21076

no relevant reference is asserted to have been withheld
various references stated that certain prior_art_compounds were known to be atypical_antipsychotics such as clozapine and fluperlapine
for example the cited hunziker reference identifies fluperlapine as a` non-classical neuroleptic' i.e. antipsychotic` like clozapine
`` 2 u.s._patent_no._4308,207 col.3 ll.5-9
astrazeneca points out that since the hunziker reference describes fluperlapine as having atypical_properties astrazenecas internal_test_data on whether fluperlapine is atypical is at most cumulative information

with all of the references before him the examiner made a prima facie obviousness rejection based on the structural_similarity between quetiapine and the two prior_art_compounds that he identified as structurally closest to quetiapine ; that is schmutz_x and the horrom_compound
as we have discussed astrazeneca responded that it had test_data for the horrom_compound but that it did not have test_data for schmutz_x and provided test_data for schmutz_b ; astrazeneca told the examiner that the test_data on schmutz_x would be` very expensive to generate now' and that schmutz_b was actually structurally closer to quetiapine than schmutz_x. appellants charge that both of these statements to the examiner are material_misrepresentations
astrazeneca replies that both statements are accurate and true

first the appellants argue that astrazeneca falsely stated that generating test_data on schmutz_x would be` very expensive'
appellants contend that expense was mere pretext asserted because astrazeneca believed that schmutz_x was atypical based on the structural_similarity between schmutz_x and compound 24028 which astrazeneca knew to have potential atypical_properties
appellants do not assert that astrazeneca had data for schmutz_x and withheld it ; nor do they argue that schmutz_x is in fact atypical and no data are presented to this effect
instead the appellants seem to argue that because of the structural_similarity between schmutz_x and compound 24028 schmutz_x could be atypical and thus should have been synthesized and its antipsychotic_properties tested
the appellants position appears to be that astrazenecas failure to do so was a material_withholding or omission with deceptive_intent

although there may be situations in which the failure to conduct specific tests of specific compounds can be criticized in this case there was no evidence that the information gleaned if such tests had been conducted would have been material to patentability
it was not disputed that it was unpredictable whether a given compound would exhibit atypical_antipsychotic *775 properties
the record demonstrates that structural_similarity is not a predictor of whether antipsychotic behavior would be typical or atypical
as astrazeneca points out the properties of these structurally similar_compounds vary significantly with minor structural changes.3 the appellants made no showing as to whether the structural_similarity between schmutz_x and compound 24028 would establish whether schmutz_x would have atypical_properties
in the context of the knowledge in this field as reflected in the various references astrazenecas provision of its existing test_data for schmutz_b instead of preparing and testing schmutz_x can not constitute a material_misrepresentation
the district_court correctly so held

the appellants also argue that astrazeneca should have submitted to the examiner its existing test_data for compound 24028 because compound 24028 and schmutz_b are` equally close' to quetiapine
the appellants_state that the data should have been submitted although not identified or requested by the examiner

to ascertain what is` equally close' in identifying the structurally closest_prior_art the compounds are viewed as they would be perceived by persons experienced in the particular field of science
precedent suggests that as a starting point it is useful to ascertain the common_elements of the claimed invention and the prior_art
see in re merchant 575_f.2d_865 868 cust
& pat.app.1978 determining the common_elements
thus the appellants point out that compound 24028 schmutz_b and quetiapine differ only in their respective side chains
that is correct
however astrazeneca is also correct in pointing out that schmutz_bs hydroxyethyl side chain is structurally closer to quetiapines hydroxyethoxyethyl side chain both in length of the chain and in the hydroxyl end group than is compound 24028s methyl side chain as shown below

?
the patent_examiner did not dispute astrazenecas scientific position and accepted the proffered data on schmutz_b as the closest_prior_art
accordingly astrazenecas substitution of schmutz_b in place of schmutz_x was not a material_misrepresentation and the non-provision of the data on compound 24028 which is structurally less similar to quetiapine was not a material omission
*776 the appellants also argue that astrazenecas submission of its internal_test_data of schmutz_b along with its internal_test_data of schmutz_a was an implied_misrepresentation because it omitted other internal_test_data of potentially atypical compounds including fluperlapine perlapine compound 21076 and compound 24028
we agree with the district_court that the migler_declaration which was directed to the closest_prior_art_compounds was not an implied_misrepresentation
astrazeneca has not asserted that no prior_art_compound is atypical
rather astrazeneca demonstrated as the examiner required that the structurally closest_prior_art_compounds did not possess the same properties as quetiapine
the prosecuting attorney explained that schmutz_a was on the same list of antipsychotics as schmutz_x
a reasonable_examiner would not have understood the migler_declaration as stating that no prior_art_product had the atypical property shown by quetiapine for it was known that other atypical_antipsychotics existed including fluperlapine and clozapine
a reasonable_examiner would understand astrazenecas statements to refer to the closest_prior_art_compounds not all prior_art_compounds
astrazenecas inclusion of the schmutz_a data is not an` implied' misrepresentation

we conclude as did the district_court that the evidence can not support a finding that astrazeneca misrepresented or omitted material_information

deceptive intent
intent to deceive is an independent element of inequitable_conduct and must be independently established by clear and convincing_evidence
star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1365 ; cargill 476 f.3d at 1364 ; see molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1181 fed.cir.1995` [ c ] lear and convincing_evidence must prove that an applicant had the specific intent to accomplish an act that the applicant ought not to have performed viz. misleading or deceiving the pto
in a case involving nondisclosure of information clear and convincing_evidence must show that the applicant made a deliberate decision to withhold a known material reference
`` ; allen organ co. v. kimball int l inc. 839_f.2d_1556 1567 fed.cir.1988` [ m ] ateriality does not presume intent which is a separate and essential component of inequitable_conduct'

appellants_state that they have shown a` high_degree of materiality' and that they therefore need a proportionally lesser showing of intent to deceive to establish the requisite threshold level of intent
that is incorrect
evidence of mistake or negligence even gross negligence is not sufficient to support inequitable_conduct in patent_prosecution
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876
to establish the requisite deceptive_intent` the involved conduct viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence indicative of good faith must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive'
id
while the court must as the final step weigh and balance the findings of materiality and intent this presupposes that a threshold level of both of these elements has already been established by clear and convincing_evidence
see manville sales corp. v. paramount systems inc. 917_f.2d_544 551 fed.cir.1990` inequitable conduct requires proof by clear and convincing_evidence
a threshold showing of both materiality and intent to mislead or deceive must be first established and then those fact-findings are balanced to make the determination whetherthe scales tilt to a conclusion that inequitable_conduct occurred
``

the only evidence of intent offered by the appellants is astrazenecas internal knowledge of certain compounds *777 of this structural class that were atypical without including this information in the ids
the appellants argue that it is irrelevant that the omitted compounds are not the closest structural analogs and irrelevant that the patent_examiner asked for comparative_data for other closer compounds
the appellants offer no evidence or suggestion of deceptive_intent other than the fact that this information was not provided
the law is clear that` inequitable_conduct requires not intent to withhold but rather intent to deceive
intent to deceive can not be inferred simply from the decision to withhold [ information ] where the reasons given for the withholding are plausible'
dayco products inc. v. total containment inc. 329_f.3d_1358 1367 fed.cir.2003
as argued by appellants an applicant would not know how much of its research effort must be filed with the pto although of no interest to the examiner or run the risk of accusation of wrongdoing no matter where the line is drawn

as we have discussed the omitted test_data were not material because the compounds were not the structurally closest_compounds whereas astrazeneca and the examiner focused on the structurally closest_compounds
although the appellants argue that this is an inadequate reason no evidence of bad faith has been proffered concerning the omission of data for the less similar_compounds astrazeneca presented plausible reasons for its presentation of arguments and data during the prosecution and although the appellants dispute astrazenecas reasoning intentional withholding for the purpose of deceiving the examiner is unsupported by evidence sufficient to avert summary_judgment

we reach the same conclusion as did the district_court that the appellants have not provided evidence sufficient to establish the threshold facts of material_withholding with the intent to deceive
the grant of summary_judgment of no inequitable_conduct is affirmed
