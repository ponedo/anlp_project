the ¡¬645_patent claims a portable_microprocessor_system with sufficient_processing_power memory and network_compatibility for business_applications
¡¬645_patent col.3 ii.18-20
figure 1 below depicts this system with the microprocessor contained in the main_housing under the label 10
the specification teaches that the main_housings size and weight account in part for the systems portability
id
col.1_ii.29-36 56-62 ; col.3 ii.44-45
the main_housing` resembles a brick' about eleven inches high eight inches wide and three inches thick
it weighs approximately eight pounds
as illustrated in figure 2 the main_housing may fit in one half of an attache case
id
col.3 ii.33-45

?
the system also includes the capability to connect to peripheral_devices such as a keyboard or mouse
the parties agree that the term` peripheral_device' means` an external device that is capable of connecting to and is capable of being controlled by a computer'

the main_housing connects to these peripheral_devices either through individual_connectors one connector per peripheral_device or through a docking connector which` allows all peripheral_connections to be realized through a single_connector'
¡¬645_patent col.1 ii.24-31 ; col.2 ii.23-34
the docking connector simplifies coupling and decoupling of the main_housing with peripheral_devices
id
col.1_ii.29-36 ; col.3 ii.64-66` [ o ] nly one connection is necessary to disconnect the system or connect the system`

each of the asserted claims requires a` portable_computer' or` portable_computer microprocessing system' the` portable_computer_limitation' and a` single_connector for making all connections from the microprocessor to said specific_computer_peripheral_devices' the` all connections_limitation'
claim 28 is representative of the three asserted independent claims 28
a portable_computer comprising a a microprocessor for processing instructions ; b a housing containing the microprocessor ; c a plurality of computer-peripheral-device-specific_connectors in electrical_communication with the microprocessor such that each of said plurality of computer-peripheral-device specific_connectors provides a computer-peripheral-device specific data link to said microprocessors said connectors for connecting the microprocessor to specific_computer_peripheral_devices *1372 and being mounted on the housing ; and
d another single_connector on the housing said single_connector comprising a set of pins said set further comprising a plurality of subsets of computer-peripheral-device-specific_pins being in electrical_communication with said microprocessor such that one of each of said subsets of computer-peripheral-device-specific_pins provides the same computer-peripheral-device-specific data link as said each of said plurality of computer-peripheral-device-specific_connectors said single_connector for making all connections from the microprocessor to said specific_computer_peripheral_devices

during prosecution the examiner rejected several claims as anticipated and obvious in view of u.s. patent no._5030,128 to herron et_al
( ¡¬128_patent or herron
herron discloses a laptop_computer and a docking_module that facilitates operation on a desktop
herron connects each peripheral to the docking_module
¡¬128_patent col.2 ii.3-38
attempting to distinguish herron the applicants expressly defined their invention in different terms
in addition the applicants amended the claims
after an interview the examiner found that the amended` claims directed to redundant connectors one set plural & one a single_connector would be allowable'
the ¡¬645_patent issued in february 1993 and was later assigned to cdsc

defendants produce various computer devices including laptops and docking_stations
in its amended complaint cdsc identified a number of defendants laptop_computers and docking_stations as infringing
the record shows that each accused laptop_computer has a built-in display or keyboard

the district_court construed` portable_computer' and` portable_computer microprocessing system' in the preambles of the asserted claims to mean` a computer without a built-in display or keyboard that is capable of being moved or carried about'
claim_construction_order 2006 u.s._dist
lexis 58388 at *32-33
the trial_court determined that the prosecution_history and the specification distinguished the claimed invention from a laptop_computer
in particular the district_court found that the applicants had emphasized the differences between their invention and laptop_computers to overcome the examiners rejections based on herron
because the district_court held that the statements in the prosecution_history amounted to a clear and unmistakable_disavowal it construed the terms` portable_computer' and` portable_computer microprocessing system' to exclude computers with built-in displays or keyboards
id.at *18-24
the district_court also construed the phrase` said single_connector for making all connections from the microprocessor to said computer peripheral_devices' to require` that all individual peripheral_device connections on the housing that connect to the microprocessor also pass through the single_connector'
id.at *40-45

based on these claim interpretations cdsc itself sought entry of final_judgment of non-infringement conceding that none of the accused products meets the courts construction of the portable_computer_limitation
cdsc also noted that some of the accused products do not satisfy the all connections_limitation
cdsc admitted that each accused product` includes a computer that has a keyboard and display that *1373 are affixed to the housing.. and are not designed to be detached in ordinary use'

`` it is well-settled that in interpreting an asserted claim the court should look first to the intrinsic evidence of record i.e. the patent itself including the claims the specification and if in evidence the prosecution_history'
id
claim terms are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning which is` the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary_skill in the art in question at the time of the invention'
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1313 fed.cir.2005 en banc citations omitted
however the person of ordinary *1374 skill is deemed to read the claim_terms in the context of the entire_patent including the specification and prosecution_history
id

occasionally specification explanations may lead one of ordinary_skill to interpret a claim_term more narrowly than its plain meaning suggests
nonetheless this court will not countenance the importation of claim limitations from a few specification statements or figures into the claims see id.at 1323 warning against importing limitations from specification and noting that` although the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments' particularly if those specification extracts describe only embodiments of a broader claimed invention see e.g. verizon servs corp. v. vonage holdings corp. 503_f.3d_1295 1302-03 fed.cir.2007 examples of translation in specification involving change in protocol from higher to lower level did not support importing a high-to-low limitation into claims ; liquid dynamics corp. v. vaughan co. 355_f.3d_1361 1366 1369 fed.cir.2004 subset of figures from specification depicting perfectly helical_flow of slurry in a slurry tank did not limit claim which required` substantial [ ly ] helical' flow to perfectly helical_flow
by the same token` the specificationis always highly relevant to the claim_construction_analysis
usually it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term
`` phillips 415 f.3d at 1315 quoting vitronics 90 f.3d at 1582
the specification may show that` the patentee has disclaimed subject matter or has otherwise limited the scope of the claims'
rexnord corp. v. laitram_corp. 274_f.3d_1336 1343 fed.cir.2001
for example repeated and definitive remarks in the written description could restrict a claim limitation to a particular structure
see watts v. xl sys. 232_f.3d_877 882 fed.cir.2000

statements made during prosecution may also affect the scope of the claims
rexnord 274 f.3d at 1343
specifically` a patentee may limit the meaning of a claim_term by making a clear and unmistakable_disavowal of scope during prosecution'
purdue pharma l.p. v. endo pharms. inc. 438_f.3d_1123 1136 fed.cir.2006
a patentee could do so for example by clearly characterizing the invention in a way to try to overcome rejections based on prior_art
see e.g. microsoft_corp. v. multi-tech sys. inc. 357_f.3d_1340 1349 fed.cir.2004 limiting the term` transmitting' to require direct transmission over telephone line because the patentee stated during prosecution that the invention transmits over a standard telephone line thus disclaiming transmission over a packet-switched network ; alloc v. int l trade comm n 342_f.3d_1361 1372 fed.cir.2003 finding the patentee expressly disavowed floor paneling systems without` play' because the applicant cited the feature during prosecution to overcome prior_art ; bell atl

the doctrine of prosecution_disclaimer` protects the publics reliance on definitive statements made during prosecution' by` precluding patentees from recapturing through claim interpretation specific meanings [ clearly and unmistakably ] disclaimed *1375 during prosecution'
omega eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1323-24 fed.cir.2003 citing in part schriber-schroth co. v. cleveland trust co. 311_u.s._211 220-21 61_s.ct._235 85_l.ed._132_(1940) bracketed material added

prosecution_disclaimer does not apply to an ambiguous disavowal
see n. telecom ltd. v. samsung elec co. 215_f.3d_1281 1293-95 fed.cir.2000 holding that prosecution_disclaimer did not` support the judicial narrowing of a clear claim_term' because the inventors statements were amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations ; pall corp. v. pti techs inc. 259_f.3d_1383 1393-94 fed.cir.2001 remanding because the scope of disclaimer over the prior_art reference was ambiguous vacated on other grounds 535_u.s._1109 122_s.ct._2324 153_l.ed.2d_152_(2002)
prosecution_disclaimer does not apply for example if the applicant simply describes features of the prior_art and does not distinguish the claimed invention based on those features
see eolas techs. inc. v. microsoft_corp. 399_f.3d_1325 1337 fed.cir.2005
and if the specification expressly defines a claim_term and` remarks made to distinguish claims from the prior_art are broader than necessary to distinguish the prior_art the full breadth of the remark is not a clear and unambiguous disavowal of claim_scope as required to depart from the meaning of the term provided in the written description

as a threshold matter neither party disputes that the terms` portable_computer' and` portable_computer microprocessing system' as used in the preambles of the asserted claims limit their scope
`` in considering whether a preamble limits a claim the preamble is analyzed to ascertain whether it states a necessary and defining aspect of the invention or is simply an introduction to the general field of the claim'
on demand mach corp. v. ingram indus. 442_f.3d_1331 1343 fed.cir.2006
the terms at issue here clearly recite a necessary and defining aspect of the invention specifically its portability
the written description and applicants statements during prosecution emphasize this feature of the invention yet this limitation does not appear in the body of the claims
as a result this court finds that the terms` portable_computer' and` portable_computer microprocessing system' limit the scope of the asserted claims

the district_court construed the portable_computer_limitation to require` a computer without a built-in display or keyboard that is capable of being moved or carried about'
claim_construction_order 2006 u.s._dist
lexis 58388 at *32-33
the parties do not dispute that the limitation requires a computer` that is capable of being moved or carried about'
this court agrees that the plain meaning of` portable' and its use in the specification and prosecution_history require the computer to be` capable of being moved about'
this appeal focuses on the` a built-in display or keyboard' component of the district_courts construction

during prosecution in a response dated june_15,_1992 the applicants sought *1376 to distinguish their invention from herron
the applicants statements clearly and unambiguously disavowed computers with built-in displays and keyboards-that is laptops
at the outset of those statements the applicants distinguished their invention a portable_microprocessing_system from its peripheral_devices the applicants invention is a portable_microprocessing_system with a microcomputer contained within a housing
as is typical of such systems the microprocessor interfaces with several peripheral_devices including a keyboard display modem serial and parallel port devices a power source etc
the applicants system provides all of the interfaces for these devices at a set of interface_connectors on the rear_bezel of the housing
amendment to u.s. application no._07 /711,816 dated june_15,_1992 at 13
the applicants expressly listed a keyboard and display as peripheral_devices
they also explained that the interface_connectors for the keyboard and display are located on the rear_bezel of the housing
if the keyboard and display were built-in or attached to the housing like a laptop these peripheral_connections would not be necessary

in the same response the applicants also contrasted the advantages of their invention with the limitations of the herron laptop the applicants system therefore provides an extremely powerful utility
a full-sized microprocessor with large_memory_capacity is made completely portable
the processing unit housing or` brick' can be easily removed from one system and transported in a briefcase to another system
rather than requiring a portable display and keyboard the present_invention concentrates on portability of an exceptionally large_memory_capacity in hard disk drive.. for the same sized unit as a conventional lap-top_computer the invention does require that peripherals be made available at each location a requirement that would lead one away from the present_invention
however even that requirement can be an advantage over laptop_computers in that higher quality peripherals will more likely be used since they need not be transported
thus lap-top machines make concessions in memory display and other areas in favor of portability
the applicants system on the other hand is a portable full service microprocessing system which concedes portability of peripherals
id.at 14-15
( emphases added
in this statement the applicants clearly distinguished their invention from computers with a built-in display or keyboard
they told the examiner that the invention concedes portability of peripherals which they previously defined to include displays and keyboards in favor of processing power and memory
as a result they stated that the invention does not require a built-in display and keyboard
in fact the applicants explained that the invention requires these peripherals at each location of use
in contrast the applicants emphasized that laptops sacrificed the power of the claimed full-service microprocessing system in favor of built-in peripherals
the applicants also stated that the built-in display and keyboard of a laptop would be inferior in quality to the peripherals stored permanently at each location and used with the claimed invention

moreover the applicants further distinguished their system from the herron *1377` laptop_computer with its own_flat_panel_display and keyboard' arguing that laptops did not have the memory capacity utilities and functionalities of their system the herron_system does not allow a microprocessor having state-of-the-art memory capacity and other capabilities to interface to a full-service processing system as does the applicants system
the herron_system allows a lap-top_computer with its own_flat_panel_display and keyboard to interface to other peripheral_devices
this lap-top_computer does not possess utilities and functionalities comparable to those of the applicants system
id.at 17

the applicants also distinguished their invention from laptops based on how the devices connect to the docking_station
because the keyboard and display are not built into the claimed microprocessing system the applicants described the system as able to fit vertically in the docking_station
because of its built-in keyboard and display a laptop could not fit vertically
specifically the applicants stated` the herron reference discloses a docking_module which is latched to the rear of a lap-top_computer
the computer and docking_module rest on a desk top'
id.at 16
`` [ t ] he computer in herron is not oriented vertically as in the applicants system
it would make no sense to do so with the herron lap-top with its attached keyboard and display
therefore herron does not have the applicants reduced footprint size'
id.at 17

this response to the examiner also referred to laptops
in this statement the applicants saw that laptops too might find a use for the claimed system a single_connector to implement all of the interfaces provides for easy connection and disconnection and may be used to advantage with lap-top_computers as well
for example the lap-top system of herron et_al
docks to several connectors making it difficult to align the connectors before docking
id.at 15

this statement however does not bring a laptop within the scope of the claims
instead the statement suggests that one component of the claimed invention a single_docking_connector could be used with laptops
the single_docking_connector is one of several limitations recited in the claims recited separately from the portable_computer_limitation
thus this reference to laptops if anything just represents another attempt to distinguish the invention from the laptops of herron

a careful reading of the prosecution_history leaves little doubt that the distinctions between the invention and herron are more extensive than only the single_connector limitation
this court observes that the applicants distinguished their invention from the prior_art in multiple ways
nonetheless a disavowal if clear and unambiguous can lie in a single_distinction among many
see andersen corp. v. fiber composites llc 474_f.3d_1361 1374 fed.cir.2007 ; norian corp. v. stryker corp. 432_f.3d_1356 1362 fed.cir.2005` [ w ] e have not allowed [ patentees ] to assert that claims should be interpreted as if they had surrendered only what they had to`
moreover the examiners citation of the single_connection_limitation in the reasons for allowability does not erase the applicants clear_disavowal of laptops
cf laitram_corp. v. morehouse indus. inc. 143_f.3d_1456 1462 fed.cir.1998 finding prosecution statements relevant to claim_construction although the *1378 examiner did not rely on them
of course a multitude of distinctions may serve to make any single_distinction in the group less clear and unmistakable as the point of distinction over prior_art and as a critical defining point for the invention as a whole

moreover the prosecution_history must always receive consideration in context
for instance in 3m innovative props. 350 f.3d at 1373 this court held that the patentee had` expressly defined a term in the specification' and that the definition would control over broad remarks during prosecution
in this case however the specification of the ¡¬645_patent does not provide an express definition of` portable_computer' that would override or make the distinctions in the prosecution_history ambiguous

as noted the specification in this case does not create any ambiguity
the background section describes a hierarchy of computer_systems based on` size and processing ability' mainframe systems mini-computer_systems microcomputer_systems or personal computers and laptop_computers
¡¬645_patent col.1 ii.7-21
thus the specification contrasts the microcomputer_system with a laptop_computer
furthermore the specification repeatedly describes the invention as a microcomputer
see e.g. id. abstract` a microcomputer_system includes a microprocessor and a housing for holding the microprocessor
`` ; col.3 ii.14-16` in accordance with the present_invention a microcomputer works equally well for business_applications as it does for personal applications
`` ; col.3 ii.21-22` fig._1 depicts the main_housing 10 of the microcomputer of the present_invention'
in contrast the specification never identifies the invention as a laptop

cdsc argues that the specification discloses an embodiment with a built-in display and keyboard specifically the embodiment illustrated in figures 13-15
however the text and the figures demonstrate that the keyboard and display are not actually built into the computer in this disclosed embodiment
rather the specification explains that a keyboard and visual_display are` options available with the system'
id
col.2_ii.8-11
figure 13 shows how a keyboard 60 and display 58` may be coupled to the microcomputer_system'
id
col.7 ii.23-24 ; see also id. col.2 ii.64-66` fig._13 shows a possible configuration of the microcomputer_system that includes a keyboard a visual_display and a dc power source`
as discussed above the background of the invention distinguishes microcomputers from laptop_computers
and the keyboard shown in figure 13 is physically separate from the main_housing
the text confirms that the keyboard is connected to the housing using connector_24b shown on the left-hand_side of the rear_bezel in figure 6
id
col.5 ii.30-31
thus a cable connects the physically separate keyboard to the main_housing
the keyboard is neither built-in nor attached
figure 15 only illustrates that the keyboard may be folded with the display and microcomputer for economy of space
id
col.3 ii.1-3 ; col.7 ii.43-44
further the display illustrated in figure 14 is easily attachable and detachable not built-in
the specification describes using connectors 70_and_72 a` mechanical mechanism' and thumb screws 65 which` simplif [ y ] the process of removing the mechanical connections'
id
col.7 ii.28-42

the claims do not recite the term` microcomputer'
this point however does not alone expand the claims beyond the microcomputer embodiment described in the specification
to the contrary a person *1379 of ordinary_skill is deemed to read the claim_terms in the context of the entire_patent including the specification and prosecution_history
phillips 415 f.3d at 1313
thus the specification does not suggest that the claimed invention encompasses laptops
rather the written description emphasizes differences between the claimed invention and laptops
at a minimum the specification does not cut against the applicants clear_disavowal of laptop_computers in the june_15,_1992 response

as noted above the` totality of the prosecution_history' informs the disavowal inquiry
rheox inc. v. entact inc. 276_f.3d_1319 1326 fed.cir.2002
here the sum of the patentees statements during prosecution would lead a competitor to believe that the patentee had disavowed coverage of laptops

seachange int l inc. v. c-cor inc. 413_f.3d_1361 1372 fed.cir.2005 prosecution_disclaimer protects the right of competitors to rely on representations made by the patentee during prosecution to guide their conduct
cdsc can not recapture claim_scope disavowed during prosecution to prove infringement
see chimie 402 f.3d at 1384
the trial_court correctly determined that the portable_computer_limitation requires` a computer without a built-in display or keyboard that is capable of being moved or carried about'

summary judgment is appropriate if` there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and.. the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 c
cdsc stipulated that if the claims are construed to require a computer without a built-in display and keyboard defendants accused laptops and docking_stations do not infringe
thus without a dispute of fact on a limitation required by every asserted claim this court finds that defendants are entitled to summary_judgment of non-infringement
because defendants laptops and docking_stations do not infringe the portable_computer_limitation this court does not reach the issues related to the all connections_limitation including the district_courts denial of cdscs rule 56 f motion

a court may award reasonable attorney_fees to prevailing parties under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the case is` exceptional'

when the accused infringer prevails in the underlying action factors relevant to the inquiry include the closeness of the question pre-filing investigation and discussions with the defendant and litigation behavior
see serio-us indus. inc. v. plastic recovery techs. inc. 459_f.3d_1311 1322 fed.cir.2006 upholding trial_courts finding that defendant was not entitled to award of attorney_fees under ¡± 285 when plaintiff relied on opinion of patent counsel and made efforts to talk with defendant before bringing suit ; cambridge prods. ltd. v. penn nutrients inc. 962_f.2d_1048 1050 fed.cir.1992 concluding that reasonable pre-filing inquiry shown by plaintiffs testing of sample of allegedly infringing product commissioning chemical analyses and acquiring documentary evidence that appeared to confirm that accused product fell within chemical specifications of patented method even if plaintiff did not ask alleged infringer about the method it practiced
if the patentee prolongs litigation in bad faith an exceptional finding may be warranted

*1380 this court detects no clear_error in the district_courts finding that this case is not exceptional
with respect to cdscs decision to file suit the district_court found that the applicants disavowal of laptops` did not seem self-evident at the beginning of the claim_construction_analysis'

the district_court also found that cdsc` engaged in a serious effort to evaluate the likelihood of success on its patent claims'
id.at *13
the record supports this finding
cdsc submitted affidavits from its employees and its in-house and outside counsel who attested to cdscs pre-filing investigation of the patent prosecution_history and the accused devices
before filing suit one of cdscs engineers dismantled and performed various electrical tests on one of the defendants accused products cdsc engaged in licensing discussions or attempted to do so with each defendant and cdsc sent infringement charts to each defendant
id.at *12
although this court agrees with the district_court that the applicants clearly disavowed laptops in the prosecution_history based on the evidence of pre-filing activities in the record the district_courts finding that the action was not objectively baseless was not clearly erroneous
see serio 459 f.3d at 1322 ; see also kao corp. v. unilever u.s. inc. 441_f.3d_963 974 fed.cir.2006 affirming denial of attorney_fees despite the patentees knowledge that the claims did not cover salt forms of copolymer and that the accused infringers products used a salt form of polymer

the district_court also found that cdscs decision to continue the litigation after the district_courts claim_construction did not make this an exceptional case

cdsc attempted to obtain a final_judgment of non-infringement to expedite appeal of the district_courts claim_constructions
the parties could not agree on the form of judgment with respect to the all connections_limitation
as a result the district_court denied the motion and later granted defendants motion for summary_judgment on both limitations
on appeal the parties devote substantial portions of their briefs to addressing the construction of the all connections_limitation and whether there are disputed issues of material_fact with respect to whether at least some of the accused products infringe it
if this court had reversed the district_courts construction of the portable_computer_limitation cdsc might have been able to prevail on the all connections_limitation
thus the district_court did not clearly err in refusing to find the case exceptional based on cdscs decision to continue the litigation

this court affirms the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement of the portable_computer_limitation and its denial of attorney_fees and costs under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
