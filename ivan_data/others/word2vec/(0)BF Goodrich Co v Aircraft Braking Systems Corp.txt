b.f._goodrich_co. v. aircraft braking sys. c.a
nos._91-48 /91-515-slr d.del
nov._10,_1994
because we conclude that the patents are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and that bfg did not engage in inequitable_conduct we affirm

background
bfg is the assignee of the017 and895_patent s. the017_patent is directed to a method of overhauling a disk_brake_assembly
the895_patent is a division of the017_patent and contains apparatus claims for a disk_brake_assembly
both patents are entitled to the benefit of the017_patents july_2,_1984 filing date and thus july_2,_1983 is the critical_date for purposes of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102

the claimed brake_assembly is used in aircraft landing gear wheels
figure 4 of the patents is a cross-sectional view illustrating the assembly

?
-- -- - the assembly includes stators 46 positioned between rotors 50
the stators 46 and rotors 50 consist of carbon_disks and are sandwiched between end_plates 48
the rotors 50 are mechanically attached to a rim not shown on which is mounted a tire so that when the wheel rotates rotors 50 rotate between stators 46
when the brake is activated piston 26 applies pressure to one of the two end_plates 48 which in turn forces together the rotors and stators against end plate 44 so that the resulting friction between the rotors and stators stops the wheel
eventually the carbon_disks become worn through friction and must be replaced since a minimum thickness of the disks is required to absorb the heat generated by the friction and ensure effective braking operation

the invention provides a brake_assembly having alternating thick and thin_disks referred to as a thick/thin_assembly consisting of for example thin stators and thick rotors
the disks tend to wear evenly
accordingly when the thin_disks become worn to the point of requiring replacement the thick_disks are only half worn
only the original thin_disks are replaced and they are replaced with thick_disks
the process can be repeated and during each maintenance interval only half of the disks are thus replaced

in comparison prior_art brake assemblies had disks of uniform thickness
during *1580 prosecution the patentee distinguished its invention over this feature of the prior_art brake assemblies
in response to a final rejection of the017_patent of the ground of obviousness the applicant submitted an affidavit by wesley s. perry director of engineering for bfg
the following are relevant_portions of the perry_affidavit
that.. he has not seen or heard of the brake_construction and method shown and described in the [ bfg_patent_application ] ; that as director of engineering he had the responsibility for reading the literature and trade journals on aircraft_brakes and has attended numerous seminars and trade_shows on aircraft_brakes ; that at no time in the literature or at seminars and trade_shows he has attended has the brake_construction and method shown and described in the [ bfg_patent_application ] been suggested ;

.
.
.
.
.
that the common practice in overhauling carbon_brakes is to replace all the brake_disks after they are substantially completely worn with full_thickness_disks and that it would not be obvious to replace one set of stators or rotors with a new or refurbished set of full_thickness_disks while the other set is half worn at overhaul intervals shorter than the refurbished interval for the disks as taught and shown in the [ bfg_patent_application ] ;

.
.
.
.
.
that based on his observation and knowledge of the ordinary_skilled worker overhauling carbon_brakes the ordinary_skilled worker would not have found it expedient through routine experimentation to arrange the rotors and stators of a carbon disk brake with different available_wear_portions so that after a predetermined_number of brake_applications said available_wear_portions of a first_group of disks are substantially worn away at an intermediate_overhaul_time and said available_wear_portions of a second_group of disks are not worn away..

in response to the submission of this affidavit the u.s._patent and trademark_office pto allowed the application which issued as the017_patent
the pto subsequently allowed the divisional application which issued as the895_patent
claim 1 of the017_patent and claim 2 of the895_patent which are the only independent claims at issue read as follows 1
a method of assembling and overhauling a disk brake having a plurality of disks with available_wear_portions of predetermined different thicknesses comprising positioning a first_group of said disks in overlapping relationship with a second_group of said disks said first_group of said disks having each of said available_wear_portions of a first_thickness said second_group of said disks having each of said available_wear_portions of a second_thickness said first_thickness of each of said available_wear_portions of said first_group of said disks being less than said second_thickness of each of said available_wear_portions of said second_group of said disks replacing said first_group of said disks with a third_group of said disks at an intermediate_brake_overhaul_time when said available_wear_portions of said first_group are substantially fully worn said available_wear_portions of each of said third_group of said disks having a third thickness greater than the thickness of each of said available_wear_portions of said second_group of said disks at said intermediate_brake_overhaul_time
2
a disk_brake_assembly comprising a first_group of brake_disks and a second_group of brake_disks in axially aligned and interleaved relationship said disks of said first_group being interleaved with said disks of said second_group in alternating relationship each of said disks of said first_group and said second_group having oppositely disposed wear surfaces said wear surfaces on opposite_sides of each brake_disk of said first_group are equal in thickness said wear surfaces on opposite_sides of each brake_disk of said second_group are equal in thickness said wear surfaces of said first_group of said disks having a first_thickness said wear surfaces of said second_group of said disks having a second_thickness said first_thickness of said first_group of said disks being less than said *1581 second_thickness of said second_group of said disks whereby after a predetermined_number of brake_applications the available_wear_thickness of said first_group of said disks are substantially fully worn away at an intermediate_overhaul_time and said available_wear_thickness of said second_group of said disks are not worn away

during prosecution of the patents the pto was apparently not aware of and hence did not consider a published paper by employees of dunlop ltd
this paper entitled the economic and safety aspects of commercial aircraft carbon brakes [ hereinafter dunlop ] was presented at the international federation of airworthiness annual conference in long beach california in april 1982
although several individuals at bfg had copies of dunlop in their files bfg did not cite it to the pto during prosecution of the patent_applications
relevant portions of dunlop describe what is referred to as a 2_for_1 refurbishment scheme in which two worn_disks are machined to smoothness and then clipped together to form one` new' disk
dunlop describes how these thicker 2_for_1 disks can be used with new disks following brake chassis inspection the heat_stack can either be put back into the brake for the remainder of its life or some of the half worn discs can be assembled with re-furbished discs from other brakes
because of this arrangement it is possible to use reclaimed discs which are thicker than new discs
in other words during the machining for reclaim [ sic ] the minimum amount of carbon has been machined off in order not to waste any of this expensive material
individually these extra_thick_discs have a life potential well in excess of 3,000 landings
by the use of this half life inspection routine and by using extra_thick_discs mixed with part worn discs the cost per brake landing can be reduced significantly
id.at 11
dunlop also teaches obtaining maximum_use of the carbon_disks by building up the heat_stack to fill the space available for the disks by using a combination of new and refurbished disks
id.at 12

in addition dunlop describes brake overhaul_schedules using the 2_for_1 refurbishment technique
a chart in dunlop illustrates the overhaul_schedules
aircraft are listed on the left side of the chart and the months from october 1984 through june 1988 are listed across the top of the chart
the chart contains boxes representing a particular overhaul for the corresponding aircraft and month
the chart also contains a description of several overhaul routines the most relevant of which are referred to as overhaul combinations 3_and_5
the description for combination 3 states` new stators pressure and thrust stators half worn rotors'
that for combination 5 states` new rotors half worn stators pressure and thrust stators'
combinations 3_and_5 therefore together describe an overhaul scheme involving a thick/thin_aircraft_brake_assembly

bfg also failed to submit to the pto other prior_art that it was aware of during its prosecution of the patents
this prior_art included a concorde_manual which describes a brake overhaul method used on the concorde which was the first commercial aircraft to use carbon disk brakes
according to this method new or partially worn_disks were placed in the brake_assembly during overhaul
thus after use in this manner the carbon_disks in the concorde brake had varying thicknesses

other prior_art also included u.s._patent 3,480,115 which describes a brake_assembly having steel_disks arranged in descending order of thickness
bfg had itself used brake assemblies with steel rotors of different wear thicknesses

bfg also failed to notify the pto of certain of its own activities which may have implicated the on-sale_bar under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
bfg made a presentation in france to airbus industries which has customers in the united_states concerning the brake_assembly in january 1983
later bfg met with representatives of boeing on march_24,_1983 in seattle washington in order to discuss bfgs carbon_brakes
this meeting was part of an ongoing effort by bfg to interest boeing in its thick/thin carbon aircraft brake assemblies
even though these activities occurred before the critical_date bfg failed to disclose them to the pto during prosecution of the017 and *1582895_patent s. moreover the inventor lowell d. bok stated in his invention record which he submitted to a bfg in-house attorney that the bfg thick/thin brake assemblies had been` proposed for the 757-200 a310-big_token__300_and_767__big_token -300 aircraft [ ]'

bfg sued abs and allied-signal separately for infringement of claims 2_and_3 of the895_patent and claims 1-4 of the017_patent
both defendants counterclaimed for a declaratory_judgment of invalidity and unenforceability and the cases were consolidated for discovery and a bench trial
in its memorandum opinion following the trial the district_court held that 1 claims 2_and_3 of the895_patent and claims 1-4 of the017_patent were invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 as having been obvious over dunlop and under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b as having been on sale by virtue of bfgs activities before the critical_date ; 2 allied-signal infringed claims 2_and_3 of the895_patent and claims 1-4 of the017_patent ; 3 abs did not infringe any of the asserted claims ; and 4 bfg did not engage in inequitable_conduct during prosecution of the patents
on appeal bfg challenges the district_courts decision on validity and on infringement by abs
on cross-appeal abs and allied-signal challenge the district_courts holding that bfg did not engage in inequitable_conduct

discussion
a. obviousness
we review the district_courts conclusion of obviousness de novo as a matter of law
see jervis b. webb co. v. southern sys. inc. 742_f.2d_1388 1393 222_uspq_943 946 fed.cir.1984
a determination of obviousness is based on factual_inquiries graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 693-94 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 467 1966 which we review under the clearly erroneous standard

52 a ; webb 742 f.2d at 1393 222 uspq at 946 ; see also uniroyal inc. v. rudkin-wiley corp. 837_f.2d_1044 1050 5_uspq2d_1434 1438 fed.cir
(` the factual_findings of the district_court underlying the obviousness determination will be overturned on appeal only if they are clearly erroneous
`` cert

bfg argues that the district_court erred in holding the inventions of the895 and017_patent s to have been obvious over dunlop
bfg contends that there was no suggestion or motivation to modify the teachings of dunlop to obtain the claimed invention
in addition bfg alleges that the district_court misconstrued or failed to credit evidence of secondary_considerations such as commercial_success copying by others satisfying a long-felt need and providing significant unexpected advantages

abs and allied-signal counter that the district_court did not err in finding the invention to have been obvious over dunlop
they contend that dunlop suggested the claimed invention to one skilled in the art
they further argue that the evidence of secondary_considerations presented by bfg only served to reinforce the conclusion of obviousness

obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a legal conclusion involving four factual_inquiries
uniroyal 837 f.2d at 1050 5 uspq2d at 1438
these inquiries consist of` 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claims and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art ; and 4 secondary_considerations if any of nonobviousness'
id
secondary considerations include evidence of factors tending to show nonobviousness such as commercial_success of the invention satisfying a long-felt need failure of others to find a solution to the problem at hand and copying of the invention by others

) cert
denied 481_u.s._1052 107_s.ct._2187 95_l.ed.2d_843_(1987)

when obviousness is based on a particular prior_art reference there must be a showing of a suggestion or motivation to modify the teachings of that reference
e.g. acs hosp sys. inc. v. montefiore hosp. 732_f.2d_1572 1577 221_uspq_929 933 fed.cir.1984
this suggestion or motivation need not be expressly stated
*1583 cable elec prods. inc. v. genmark inc. 770_f.2d_1015 1025 226_uspq_881 886 fed.cir.1985

the district_court found that the invention was obvious over dunlop
the level of ordinary_skill in the art was not in dispute nor was the scope of the prior_art which included the dunlop paper the steel_brake_art such as was described in u.s._patent 3,480,115 and the concorde_manual
the difference between dunlop and the claimed inventions is relatively minor
the district_court found that the only real difference is that the claims are limited to an initial thick/thin_assembly whereas dunlop discloses the thick/thin_arrangement only for replacement of half-worn_disks during brake overhaul
the district_court stated that` figure 14 [ the overhaul_schedule ] plainly contemplates the continuation of the series of overhauls beyond the last date covered in the chart'
the district_court held that the overhaul_schedule in dunlop itself provided the suggestion for an initial thick/thin carbon brake_assembly and hence rendered the claimed invention obvious

the district_court also analyzed the secondary_considerations presented by bfg
it did not find that they overcame the strong teachings of the prior_art
the assertion of` long-felt need' was discounted because the bfg invention was similar to the teachings of dunlop
the failure of others was not found to be significant because there was only a brief time period during which manufacturers sought a solution to the problem of increased carbon_utilization in aircraft_brakes
only slight evidence of skepticism by others was presented
copying by others was not found to be compelling because there was no extensive development by competitors and a noninfringing substitute was easily designed
the advantages of the invention were not found to be necessarily unexpected given the state of the prior_art
finally the district_court found that the evidence of commercial_success was ambiguous

we conclude that the district_courts factual_findings regarding the four graham inquiries were not clearly erroneous
see fed.r.civ.p
52 a 1995
as explained above these findings were supported by the evidence of record and we do not have a definite and firm_conviction that a mistake was made as to those findings
see united_states v. united_states gypsum co. 333_u.s._364 395 68_s.ct._525 542 92_l.ed._746_(1948)` a finding isclearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been committed
``

in addition we agree with the district_courts ultimate conclusion of obviousness
as the district_court recognized the overhaul_schedule in dunlop contemplates continuation of the combination 3_and_5 overhaul methods
dunlop also teaches maximizing carbon_utilization by filling the` envelope' the space available for disks in the brake using any combination of new or part worn or reclaimed disks
in addition abss and allied-signals expert_witness as well as bfgs expert_witness testified that those skilled in the art would know to fill the brake` envelope' to obtain maximum_use of the available space
bfg has indicated a connection between an initial thick/thin_assembly and` filling the envelope'
moreover as the inventor himself agreed if a thick/thin_arrangement makes sense for an overhaul it would seem to be logical to adopt it ab initio
accordingly the teachings of dunlop to one skilled in the art provide a suggestion of an initial thick/thin brake_assembly
we also agree with the district_court that the secondary_considerations were not convincing of nonobviousness
considering the minor difference between the claimed invention and the teachings of dunlop the secondary_considerations were not sufficiently compelling
see ashland oil inc. v. delta resins & refractories inc. 776_f.2d_281 291-92 227_uspq_657 663 fed.cir.1985

because we hold that claims 2_and_3 of the895_patent and claims 1-4 of the017_patent are invalid as having been obvious over dunlop we need not reach the issues relating to the on-sale_bar and infringement

b
inequitable conduct
a determination of inequitable_conduct is committed to the district_courts discretion
accordingly we review the district *1584 courts judgment under the abuse of discretion standard
kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 cert
denied 490_u.s._1067 109_s.ct._2068 104_l.ed.2d_633_(1989)
to overturn such a discretionary ruling of a district_court` the appellant must establish that the ruling is based on clearly erroneous findings of fact or on a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or evidences a clear error of judgment on the part of the district_court'
molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 33_uspq2d_1823 1827 fed.cir.1995

abs and allied-signal allege inequitable_conduct with respect to several pieces of prior_art
in particular they allege that bfg engaged in inequitable_conduct in its failure to disclose to the pto dunlop the concorde_manual u.s._patent 3,480,115 showing an example of the steel_brake_art bfgs own steel brake prior_art and bfgs activities with boeing and airbus
they also allege that the statements in the perry_affidavit provide evidence of an intent to mislead

bfg argues that there was no intent by the inventor bok or his attorneys to mislead the pto
bfg asserts that there is no evidence that bok or his attorneys knew of dunlop during prosecution
while they of course knew of the boeing and airbus activities bfg argues that it had a reasonable belief that these activities did not violate the on-sale_bar
bfg also argues that the perry_affidavit does not show an intent to mislead the pto because all the statements in the affidavit were true

inequitable conduct consists of an` affirmative misrepresentation of a material fact failure to disclose material information or submission of false material information coupled with an intent to deceive'
molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1826
one alleging inequitable_conduct must prove the threshold elements of materiality and intent by clear and convincing evidence
id. 33 uspq2d at 1826-27
the district_court must then weigh the threshold findings of materiality and intent in light of all the circumstances to determine whether the equities warrant a conclusion that inequitable_conduct occurred
id

much of the prior_art involved here certainly was material
dunlop was directly relevant to the problem addressed by the017 and895_patent s ; it discloses techniques for increased carbon_utilization in aircraft_brakes as well as a thick/thin_aircraft_brake_assembly
bfgs sales activities were also material because they were potential statutory bars under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
the steel_brake_art included brakes having steel_disks of varying thickness and the concorde_manual disclosed carbon_brakes with disks of varying thickness
all of this prior_art was thus arguably material

the focus of the inequitable_conduct issue in this case must thus be on intent which is a question of fact
see molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1827
we must affirm the district_court on this issue unless its finding was clearly erroneous
id
the district_court was troubled by bfgs conduct but essentially gave it the benefit of the doubt because determinations of obviousness and the applicability of the on-sale_bar are often close and subject to varying reasonable interpretations
in particular the district_court stated that` [ t ] he application of the on-sale_bar in ¡± 102 b and the factors determining obviousness under ¡± 103 is by no means a certain enterprise and the fact that the court has found the patents invalid on these grounds does not mean that bfgs failure to submit this art and information in connection with its patent_applications was intentionally misleading'

we too are troubled by bfgs conduct but conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in its findings or abuse its discretion in determining that bfg did not engage in inequitable_conduct
`` [ a ] finding that particular conduct amounts togross negligence does not of itself justify an inference of intent to deceive ; the involved conduct viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence indicative of good faith must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive'
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876 9 uspq2d at 1392

there was a basis for the patent_attorney prosecuting the applications to conclude that *1585 bfgs meeting with boeing did not trigger the on-sale_bar on the ground that it was a technical not a sales meeting and thus that it need not have been disclosed to the pto
prudence would have dictated otherwise but the requisite evidence of intent to deceive is lacking
in addition the airbus activity seemingly occurred outside the united_states and its nondisclosure does not reveal an intent to deceive
even though dunlop was in the files of several bfg employees it is not clear that bok and his attorney possessed it
the evidence tends to show that bok only became aware of dunlop after the017 and895_patent s issued and the patent_attorney was not on the circulation_list to receive the publication
there is also a letter of record from bfg to a foreign attorney indicating after the patents issued that bfg had just recently become aware of dunlop
the other alleged prior_art is similarly not associated with evidence of an intent to deceive

the perry_affidavit is more troubling but also falls short of providing an inference of an intent to mislead the pto
while the statements in the affidavit are true as bfg asserts this alone does not negate a finding of inequitable_conduct since truthful statements can be crafted in a misleading manner through intentional_omission of particular relevant facts
however there is no evidence of intentional_omission of relevant facts in the affidavit and in particular no evidence that perry in fact knew of dunlop
while perry was not called as a witness at trial due to an agreement between the parties relevant_portions of his deposition transcript are of record
in perrys deposition he testified that he` may have seen it [ dunlop ] before' but did not` specifically remember seeing it'
he also testified that he did not recall seeing the copy of dunlop on which his name was handwritten as part of a circulation_list
the district_courts conclusion that evidence of intent to deceive is lacking can not be said to be clearly erroneous

we have considered whether the totality of the actions here lead to an inference of an intent to deceive even though the individual instances do not
we arrive at the same conclusion lack of evidence of intent
it is not surprising that those who are careless exhibit those qualities more than once
it still does not demonstrate without more an intent to deceive
accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in its finding of lack of intent to deceive or abuse its discretion in finding that bfg did not engage in inequitable_conduct
in the absence of an intent to deceive courts can not find inequitable_conduct merely because patents are held invalid over the relevant prior_art
having affirmed the district_courts conclusion that there was no inequitable_conduct we also affirm its conclusion that this case was not exceptional and hence its denial of attorney_fees

our conclusion does not mean however that we condone bfgs conduct in prosecuting the017 and895_patent s. barely dodging a bullet based on our deference to a trial courts decision on the factual question of intent and on a matter of equity does not merit approval or justify complacency
bfgs conduct shows a pattern of careless patent prosecution
it has led to the grant of a patent which is invalid over a withheld reference
while we have not reviewed the holding of invalidity based upon the on-sale_bar there certainly was a close question concerning that uncited event
the perry_affidavit evidences questionable conduct considering that perrys name was on a circulation_list for dunlop and that he stated in his affidavit that he was responsible for knowing the literature on aircraft_brakes and that he had never seen a brake_assembly as described and shown in the017 and895_patent s. submission of careless statements under oath deserves criticism but as noted above we are not able to conclude that the district_court erred in failing to find intent to deceive from these actions

conclusion
because the district_court did not err in holding the017 and895_patent s invalid on the ground of obviousness we affirm the district_courts judgment of invalidity
because the district_court did not err in holding *1586 that bfg did not engage in inequitable_conduct due to insufficient evidence of an intent to deceive the pto in prosecuting the017 and895_patent s we affirm the district_courts judgment regarding inequitable_conduct and we deny abss and allied-signals request for attorney_fees
in light of our holding that the017 and895_patent s are invalid on the ground of obviousness the issues relating to the on-sale_bar and infringement are moot

affirmed
