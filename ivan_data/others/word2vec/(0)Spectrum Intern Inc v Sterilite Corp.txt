spectrum international inc.` spectrum' appeals the summary_judgment of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york that sterilite corporations` sterilite' storage crates do not infringe claims 2_and_11 in spectrums reexamined u.s. patent no._4971,202` the202_patent' originally issued november 20 1990 reexamination certificate b1 4,971,202 issued may_27,_1997 either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents

because in view of the202_patents prosecution_history any infringement by sterilites accused crates can not lie as a matter of law we affirm albeit on a different rationale than the one articulated by the district_court

i
titled` stackable recycling crate' the202_patent is directed to` a box-like structure with four walls and a bottom'
'202_patent at col. 2 lines 67-68
like an ordinary uncovered box the202 crate contains a bottom_side two side walls a front_wall and a back_wall
two features alter the typical configuration of a box to enable simultaneously *1374 the placement of large articles in the crate when stacked in tandem with other crates of its kind while retaining the articles within the confines of the crate once the articles have been so placed
first the upper and lower_portions of the front_wall are cut out such that when stacked the upper cut-out portion of each lower crate and the lower cut-out portion of each upper crate together form a large overall opening into which articles may be easily placed
second the front portion of the bottom_side tapers to an incline that joins the central_portion of the front_wall forming an internal storage compartment that is further enclosed laterally by the side portions or` legs' of the front_wall remaining after the upper and lower_portions of the front_wall have been excised

the202_patent originally recited 16 claims
the broadest original claim claim 1 reads as follows 1
a stackable crate comprising a a pair of opposing sidewalls ; b a back_wall coupled to the sidewalls ; c a front_wall coupled to the sidewalls and having a first substantially rectangularly shaped opening at the top portion of the front_wall and a second substantially rectangularly shaped opening at the bottom portion of the front_wall thereby defining in the front_wall a central_portion with the bottom_edge of the central_portion extending to form at each end a lower_leg_segment and the top_edge of the central_portion extending to form at each end an upper_leg_segment ; and
( d a bottom_side being planar as the bottom_side extends away from the back_wall and tapering upwardly to merge with the central_portion wherein the bottom_side as joined to the sidewalls and to the back_wall to define a storage compartment in the interior of the crate

on january 3 1994 spectrum apprised sterilite of its view that sterilites` storage_cart' product may infringe the202_patent
on that same day spectrum also mailed a request for reexamination to the u.s. patent and trademark office` pto'
a protracted 30-month reexamination proceeding ensued culminating in a decision by the board of patent appeals and interferences mailed july_26,_1996 affirming the examiners final rejection of 11 out of the original 16 claims including claim 1
only claims 2 11 and 14-16 survived reexamination
claims 14-16 are not pertinent to this appeal and will not be further discussed

claims 2_and_11 each contain the requirement that the bottom_side of the crate merge with at least a substantial_portion of the bottom_edge of the central_portion of the crates front_wall
see202_patent at col. 5 lines 24-26 ; col. 6 lines 4-7.1 during reexamination the examiner lodged a rejection of claims 2_and_11 over a prior_art_crate shown in figure 1 disclosed in deputter u.s. patent no._3682,351` deputter'

*big_token__1375_figure_1__big_token
?
to rebut the rejection spectrum argued that in the prior_art_crate the bottom_side merges with the top_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall but not the bottom_edge
the pto sustained the patentability of claims 2_and_11 solely on the basis of this argument

armed with its board decision spectrum filed suit in the southern_district of new_york on october 24 1996 charging sterilite with infringement of claims 2_and_11 by the` storage_cart' illustrated in figure 2

figure 2. ?
after discovery a hearing was held on cross-motions for summary_judgment and on january 28 1998 the district_court issued an order and judgment granting sterilites motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement and denying spectrums cross-motion for summary_judgment of infringement
the court reasoned that because spectrum did not in the courts view provide any special definition for the claim_term` wall' the terms ordinary meaning as discerned by the court controlled
given its construction of the claims the court found that steriites accused product does not have a front_wall as required by claims 2_and_11 and as such does not infringe these claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
spectrum now appeals
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 1994

*1376 ii
spectrum predicates its argument for reversal of the district_courts decision as to both claims 2_and_11 on a deconstruction of sterilites accused product
this deconstruction presented by spectrum in its opening brief is shown in figure 3

figure 3. ?
referring to this diagram spectrum asserts that sterilites accused product contains a back_wall b a pair of opposing sidewalls a coupled to a front_wall c having rectangular openings at the top ct and bottom cb that define a central_portion cp with a top_edge cpt and bottom_edge cpb wherein the central_portion extends to form an upper_leg_segment lt and a lower_leg_segment lb and further wherein a bottom_side d that is planar as it extends away from the back_wall tapers upwardly to merge with at least a substantial_portion of the bottom_edge cpb of the front_wall along the line marked` x'
as such argues spectrum sterilites accused product meets each limitation common to claims 2_and_11

of particular note is spectrums reliance on line` x' as representing the set of points along which sterilites accused crate meets the limitation in claims 2_and_11 requiring that the upwardly tapering bottom_side merge with at least a substantial_portion of the bottom_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall

spectrum recognizes that it must rely on line` x' because unless the merger of the bottom_side and the front_wall occurs along line` x' sterilites accused product can not infringe either claim 2_or_11 whether literally or by equivalents
as the relevant portion of sterilites reply-brief diagram of its accused crates side view shown in figure 4 makes clear if the upwardly tapering d2 bottom_side d1 of the accused crate is considered to merge with the front_wall at the interface of d3 and d4 rather than at the interface of d2 and d3 as asserted by spectrum the merger of the accused crates bottom_side and its front_wall occurs at the top not the bottom of the central_portion contravening the explicit requirement in claims 2_and_11 to the contrary
accordingly literal_infringement is precluded
see e.g. mas-hamilton_group v. lagard inc. 156_f.3d_1206 1211 48_uspq2d_1010 1015 fed.cir.1998` to prove literal_infringement the patentee must show that the accused device contains every limitation in the asserted claims
if even one limitation is missing or not met as claimed there is no literal_infringement'
( internal_citations omitted
moreover because merger of the bottom_side and central_portion of the front_wall at the interface of d3 and d4 constitutes *1377 the very embodiment that spectrum explicitly relinquished during prosecution doctrine of equivalents_infringement is precluded as well under the opposing doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel
see e.g. wang lab. inc. v. mitsubishi_elecs
am. inc. 103_f.3d_1571 1577 41_uspq2d_1263 1269 fed.cir.1997` prosecution history estoppel acts as one check on application of the doctrine of equivalents by precluding a patentee from regaining through litigation coverage of subject_matter relinquished during prosecution of the application for the patent'
( internal_citations omitted

figure 4. ?
spectrum attempts to evade the consequences of a straightforward determination of noninfringement on this basis by presenting in essence two arguments
first citing moleculon_research_corp. v. cbs inc. 793_f.2d_1261 1271 229_uspq_805 812 fed.cir.1986 for the proposition that a claim employing the transitional_term` comprising' does not exclude additional unrecited_elements spectrum contends that the open` comprising' language of claims 2_and_11 permits spectrum to deconstruct sterilites cart and call line` x' the merging interface of the bottom_side and front_wall in sterilites accused crate because sterilite has done nothing more than add an irrelevant unrecited element to the` front' of an otherwise infringing device
second spectrum argues that nothing of record either limits the front_wall recited in claims 2_and_11 to any particular height or precludes claim 2_and_11 again relying on the open claim language` comprising' from encompassing crates in which the bottom_side merges with both the bottom and top of the front_walls central_portion
as such the mere fact that the central_portion of the` front_wall' in sterilites accused crate-d3 in figure 4 according to spectrum-is a single thin layer of plastic having a top and bottom that both merge with the upwardly tapering bottom_side of the accused crate does not preclude and indeed warrants a finding of infringement

the district_court focused on and found fault with the first prong of spectrums second argument i.e. spectrums contention that d3 in figure 4 is a front` wall' for purposes of claims 2_and_11
opining during oral hearing that such a construction of the term` wall' flies in the face of any reasonable interpretation of the term the district_court found that sterilites accused crate does not possess a` front_wall' as required by claims 2_and_11 and therefore does not infringe these claims as a matter of law either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents

spectrum asserts legal error in the district_courts construction of claims 2_and_11 on the ground that as its own lexicographer spectrum had made clear in the claims and written description of the202_patent that the` front_wall' of claims 2_and_11 places no limitation on the size of the openings above *1378 and below the central_portion and hence on the height of the central_portion itself
spectrum also argues in the alternative that the` legs' in the accused crate supply any requisite height requirement imposed by the claim_term` wall' and that the central_portion defined by the upper and lower openings is unbounded by any requirement for a particular vertical dimension
in either event spectrum contends that the district_court improperly interpreted claims 2_and_11 and as a result erred in finding no infringement either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
sterilite points to a dictionary definition of` wall' in support of the district_courts construction and further argues that by defining the front face of its accused crate along the line marked` x' in spectrums diagram what spectrum calls` legs' are clearly part of the side wall not the front_wall
as such sterilite urges this court to find no merit in either of spectrums theories for reversal

iii
summary_judgment is proper when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
see fed.r.civ.p
56 c
even disputed material facts will not defeat summary_judgment when taking all factual inferences in favor of the nonmovant the moving party is nonetheless entitled to judgment as a matter of law
see young dental mfg co. v. q3 special prods. inc. 112_f.3d_1137 1141 42_uspq2d_1589 1592 fed.cir.1997
we review a grant of summary_judgment de novo
see id
our review as with any infringement inquiry must first engage the legal step of construing the asserted claims and then dispose of the factual infringement issue by comparing the accused device with the asserted claims in accordance with their proper construction
see e.g. ekchian v. home depot inc. 104_f.3d_1299 1302 41_uspq2d_1364 1366 fed.cir.1997

in determining the proper meaning of the claims` we first consider the so-called intrinsic_evidence i.e. the claims the written description and if in evidence the prosecution_history'
digital_biometrics inc. v. identix inc. 149_f.3d_1335 1347 47_uspq2d_1418 1424 fed.cir.1998
moreover` [ i ] f upon examination of this intrinsic_evidence the meaning of the claim language is sufficiently clear resort to extrinsic evidence such as treatises and technical references as well as expert testimony when appropriate should not be necessary'
id

unambiguous intrinsic_evidence in turn provides sufficient input to the rules of claim_construction in particular in this case the rule that explicit statements made by a patent applicant during prosecution to distinguish a claimed invention over prior_art may serve to narrow the scope of a claim
see southwall techs inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1576 34_uspq2d_1673 1676 fed.cir.1995` the prosecution_history limits the interpretation of claim_terms so as to exclude any interpretation that was disclaimed during prosecution
`` ; standard oil co. v. american cyanamid co. 774_f.2d_448 452 227_uspq_293 296 fed.cir.1985 stating that the prosecution_history which includes` all express representations made by or on behalf of the applicant to the examiner to induce a patent grant' limits the interpretation of the claims` so as to exclude any interpretation that may have been disclaimed or disavowed during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance'2

that explicit arguments made during prosecution to overcome prior_art can lead to narrow claim interpretations makes sense because` [ t ] he public has a right to rely on such definitive statements made during prosecution'
digital_biometrics 149 f.3d at 1347 47 uspq2d at 1427 pointing to` [ n ] otice [ as ] an important function of the patent prosecution process as reflected by the [ patent ] statute itself'
indeed` [ b ] y *1379 distinguishing the claimed invention over the prior_art an applicant is indicating what the claims do not cover'
ekchian 104 f.3d at 1304 41 uspq2d at 1368
therefore a patentee after relinquishing subject_matter to distinguish a prior_art reference asserted by the pto during prosecution` can not during subsequent litigation escape reliance [ by the defendant ] upon this unambiguous surrender of subject_matter'
southwall 54 f.3d at 1581 34 uspq2d at 1681 ; ekchian 104 f.3d at 1304 41 uspq2d at 1368 citing southwall
accordingly` [ c ] laims may not be construed one way in order to obtain their allowance and in a different way against accused infringers'
southwall 54 f.3d at 1576 citing unique concepts inc. v. brown 939_f.2d_1558 1562 19_uspq2d_1500 1504 fed.cir.1991 ; see also alpex computer corp. v. nintendo co. ltd. 102_f.3d_1214 1221 40_uspq2d_1667 1672 fed.cir.1996` therefore because alpex admitted during prosecution that its claims do not cover a video display system based on shift registers as in okuda.. alpexs claims can not now be construed to cover the [ accused device ] which possesses the same structural and functional traits as okuda`
this principle applies with equal force to arguments made by a patentee to sustain the patentability of claims during reexamination
see e.g. cole v. kimberly-clark_corp. 102_f.3d_524 532 41_uspq2d_1001 1007 fed.cir.1996` we also believe the district_court correctly interpreted the prosecution_history to require that theperforation means limitation can not be construed to include ultrasonic bonded seams
cole surrendered ultrasonic bonded seams in her requests for reexamination
``

iv
as discussed spectrum argued to the pto during reexamination that the limitation in claims 2_and_11 requiring that the bottom_side of spectrums claimed crate merge with the bottom_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall distinguishes over deputter because in deputters crate the bottom_side merges with the top_edge and not the bottom_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall
spectrum now argues that this claim limitation does not exclude infringement by a crate in which the bottom_side merges with both the bottom_edge and the top_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall because the open claim_term` comprising' permits the addition of any elements to those listed in the claims
in effect spectrum argues for a broad construction of the phrase` wherein the bottom_side merges with at least a substantial_portion of the bottom_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall' that does not exclude the possibility that the bottom_side merges with both the bottom_edge and the top_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall

spectrums argument must fail
if` comprising' permits the addition of any elements then it not only permits the addition of merger of the bottom_side with the top_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall but also allows the addition of a downward-projecting appendage to the central_portion along the line at which the bottom_side merges with both the bottom and top_edges of the central_portion thus transforming merger of the bottom_side with the bottom and top_edges of the central_portion into merger of the bottom_side with the top_edge alone
but this embodiment is in the prior_art
therefore to have sustained the patentability of claims 2_and_11 over the prior_art asserted during reexamination spectrum must have relinquished from the language of these claims the possibility that merger of the bottom_side also occurs with the top_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall
were the result otherwise spectrum could cut off the downward-projecting central_portion of deputters front_wall be left with a crate in which the bottom_side merges with both the bottom and top_edges of the central_portion of the remaining front_wall add back the downward projection with` comprising' and thus hold deputter liable for infringement
this spectrum clearly can not do

spectrums reliance on moleculon_research_corp. v. cbs inc. 793_f.2d_1261 1271 229_uspq_805 812 fed.cir.1986 as support for its attempt to encompass the additional unrecited_elements in sterilites accused crate within the confines of claims 2_and_11 through recourse to the recitation in these claims of the term` comprising' is thus misplaced
to be sure moleculon acknowledges that` a transitional_term such ascomprising *1380.. does not exclude additional unrecited_elements or steps in the case of a method claim' 793 f.2d at 1271 229 uspq at 812 but in the very same sentence the court limited this broad view of` comprising' to avoid altering the scope of the particular claim step at issue
see id
neither may the term` comprising' alter the scope of the merger element in the claim at issue here
`` comprising' is not a weasel word with which to abrogate claim limitations
see id

to summarize we conclude that the limitation in claims 2_and_11 requiring that the bottom_side merge with the bottom_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall excludes the possibility that the bottom_side also merges with the top_edge
the claim_term` comprising' can not restore this excluded subject_matter

v. spectrum argues that sterilites accused crate meets each limitation in claim 2 and therefore literally infringes this claim
spectrum correctly understands that` [ i ] f even one limitation is missing or not met as claimed there is no literal_infringement'
mas-hamilton_group v. lagard inc. 156_f.3d_1206 1211 48_uspq2d_1010 1015 fed.cir.1998
summary_judgment of no literal_infringement is proper therefore when no reasonable_jury could find that every limitation recited in a properly construed claim is found in an accused device
see bai v. l & l wings inc. 160_f.3d_1350 1353-54 48_uspq2d_1674 1676 fed.cir.1998 citing cole v. kimberly-clark_corp. 102_f.3d_524 532 41_uspq2d_1001 1007 fed.cir.1996

as discussed claim 2 excludes from its literal scope the possibility that a crates bottom_side merges with both the bottom and top_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall
yet spectrum unequivocally asserts that this is precisely the configuration found in sterilites accused product
accordingly no reasonable_jury could find that sterilites accused crate meets all the limitations in claim 2 and thus sterilites crate can not literally infringe claim 2 as a matter of law

spectrum next argues that even if not literally infringed sterilites accused crate nevertheless infringes claim 2 under the doctrine of equivalents
spectrum also argues that sterilites accused crate infringes claim 11 under the doctrine of equivalents
while it is true that a product can infringe an asserted claim under the doctrine of equivalents if each element in the claim even if not literally present is met by a substantial equivalent see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 117_s.ct._1040 1049 1053 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1871 1875 1997 the countervailing doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel` bar [ s ] recapture by the patentee of scope that was surrendered in order to obtain allowance of the claims'
pall corp. v. micron separations inc. 66_f.3d_1211 1218 36_uspq2d_1225 1230 fed.cir.1995 ; see also wang lab. inc. v. mitsubishi_elecs
am. inc. 103_f.3d_1571 1577 41_uspq2d_1263 1269 fed.cir.1997
whether prosecution_history_estoppel applies is a matter of law
id
if we determine upon reviewing the relevant prosecution_history that estoppel applies doctrine of equivalents_infringement is precluded as a matter of law and summary_judgment of noninfringement is appropriate
id

here as already discussed spectrum clearly relinquished from the scope of both claims 2_and_11 the possibility that the bottom_side of a crate merges with both the bottom_edge and the top_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall in order to sustain the patentability of these claims over prior_art asserted by the examiner
these actions therefore trigger application of prosecution_history_estoppel precluding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as a matter of law
see wang lab. 103 f.3d at 1577 41 uspq2d at 1269

vi
two ancillary issues remain to be addressed
first sterilite urges us to invalidate spectrums202_patent over two items in the prior_art on condition that we adopt the district_courts claim_construction
however the district_court did not rule on validity
while we are obliged to refrain from vacating a lower courts invalidity judgment when we determine that a patent has not been infringed see *1381 phonometrics inc. v. northern telecom inc. 133_f.3d_1459 1468 45_uspq2d_1421 1428-29 fed.cir.1998 citing cardinal chem co. v. morton int l 508_u.s._83 113_s.ct._1967 124_l.ed.2d_1 26_uspq2d_1721_(1993) here there is nothing to potentially vacate
we therefore do not reach the validity issue

second spectrum urges us to reverse the district_court on the ground that the court` may have been swayed by its examination of the patentees commercial_embodiment' that it requested spectrum to submit
to be sure a court may not predicate an infringement determination on a comparison of an accused product with a patentees commercial_embodiment of his claimed invention
see e.g. international visual corp. v. crown metal mfg. 991_f.2d_768 772 26_uspq2d_1588 1591 fed.cir.1993
any error that may have been committed by the district_court in this case however is harmless in view of our claim_construction

vii
for the reasons discussed the district_courts summary_judgment of no infringement is affirmed

costs
no costs

affirmed

in claim 2 which depends from claim 1 this limitation is expressed as` wherein the bottom_side merges with at least a substantial_portion of the bottom_edge of the central_portion of the front_wall'
in claim 11 an independent claim narrower than claim 2 this limitation is expressed as` a bottom_side being planar as the bottom_side extends away from the back_wall and tapering upwards to merge with at least a substantial_portion of the bottom_edge of the central_portion' thus incorporating language from claim 1
the parties treat this limitation in the two claims as identical
we agree that there is no difference between the two expressions of this limitation and therefore treat them identically as well
2
our recourse to language emphasizing the relinquishing of subject_matter during prosecution should not be construed to undermine the` clear distinction between following the statements in the prosecution_history in defining a claim_term and the doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel which limits expansion of the protection under the doctrine of equivalents when a claim has been distinguished over relevant prior_art'
