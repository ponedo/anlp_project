background
pozen developed a method for treating migraines by combining two drugs sumatriptan and naproxen in a single_tablet
pozen_inc. v. par pharm. inc. 800_f.supp.2d_789 796 e.d.tex.2011
sumatriptan a 5-ht receptor agonist was developed in the late 1980s and is widely accepted as an effective medicine for migraines but it does not prevent the reoccurrence of migraine_symptoms
id.at 797
naproxen is a well known nonsteroidal *1157 anti-inflammatory drug` nsaid'
id.at 798
pozen in partnership with glaxosmithkline` gsk' markets a combination of sumatriptan and naproxen called treximetthe_r and holds three related patents relevant to this appeal
id
the ¡¬499_patent_claims a method of treating migraines comprising co-timely administration of 5-ht agonists and long-acting nsaids
¡¬499_patent col.1 ll.13-17
the ¡¬458_patent is a continuation of the ¡¬499_patent and claims methods and compositions combining 5-ht agonists and long-acting nsaids
¡¬458_patent col.1 ll.18-20
the ¡¬183_patent claims a multilayer_pharmaceutical_tablet with a triptan such as sumatriptan and a nsaid in separate_layers that dissolve independently
¡¬ 183 patent col.1 ll.54-57

pozen filed a new drug application` nda' to market treximetthe_r and obtained approval from the united_states food and drug administration` fda' on april_15,_2008
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 798
pozen listed the patents-in-suit in its nda as covering treximetthe_r
the patents are included in the fdas approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations known as` the orange_book' see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 b 1 indicating they could be infringed by the unlicensed manufacture use or sale of treximetthe_r
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 798

appellants are generic pharmaceutical manufacturers who filed andas with the fda seeking approval to market generic forms of treximetthe_r before the expiration of pozens patents
id
; see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 b 2 j 2
appellants filed their application certifying that the patents listed in the orange_book are` invalid or will not be infringed' by the generic_products
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv ; pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 798-99 ; such a certification constitutes an artificial_act of infringement
35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 ; warner-lambert co. v. apotex corp. 316_f.3d_1348 1365 fed.cir.2003
thereafter pozen filed complaints against appellants for infringement of claim 15 of the ¡¬499_patent ; claims 11 12 24 26 27 29 and 30 of the ¡¬458_patent ; and claim 2 of the ¡¬183_patent under the hatch-waxman act.2 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a ; pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 799

a
the relevant ¡¬499_patent claims
the district_court found appellants anda_products directly infringe claim 15 of the ¡¬499_patent which depends on claim 5 and reads 5
a therapeutic_package for dispensing to or for use in dispensing to a migraine patient which comprises a one or more unit_doses each such unit_dose comprising i a 5-ht agonist and
( ii a long-acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug la-nsaid ; wherein the respective_amounts of said 5-ht agonist and said la-nsaid in said unit_dose are effective upon concomitant_administration to said patient of one or more of said unit_doses to *1158 reduce migraine_relapse or produce longer lasting efficacy compared to the administration of said 5-ht agonist in the absence of said la-nsaid or the administration of said la-nsaid in the absence of said 5-ht agonist and
( b a finished pharmaceutical_container therefor said container containing said unit_dose or unit_doses said container further containing or comprising labeling directing the use of said package in the treatment of migraine
... 15
the improvement method or composition of claims 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 8 wherein said 5-ht agonist is sumatriptan said la-nsaid is naproxen and the unit_dosage_form is an oral unit_dosage_form comprising sumatriptan in an amount greater than 15 mg and naproxen in an amount greater than 200 mg. ¡¬499_patent col.14 ll.1-19 ; col.15_ll.12-17

b
the relevant ¡¬458_patent claims
the district_court found appellants anda_products directly infringe claims 11 12 and 24 which depend on claim 3 as well as claims 26 27 29 and 30 which specify sumatriptan is the 5-ht agonist and naproxen is the la-nsaid used in various dosages
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 806
representative claim 3 states 3
a pharmaceutical composition in unit_dosage_form useful in treating a migraine headache patient which comprises a a 5-ht agonist wherein said 5-ht agonist is a triptan ; and
( b a long-acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug la-nsaid wherein said la-nsaid has a pharmacokinetic half-life of at least 4 hours and a duration of action of at least 6 hours ; wherein the respective_amounts of said 5-ht agonist and said la-nsaid in said composition are effective upon concomitant_administration to said patient of one or more of said unit_dosage_forms of said composition to produce longer lasting efficacy compared to the administration of said 5-ht agonist in the absence of said la-nsaid or the administration of said la-nsaid in the absence of said 5-ht agonist
¡¬458_patent col.12 ll.29-45

c. the relevant ¡¬183_patent claims
the district_court held that under the doctrine of equivalents par and drls anda_products infringe claim 2 of the ¡¬183_patent which is dependent on claim 1 and reads 1
a multilayer_pharmaceutical_tablet comprising naproxen and a triptan and wherein a substantially all of said triptan is in a first_layer of said tablet and substantially all of said naproxen is in a second separate_layer ; and
b said first_layer and said second_layer are in a side by side_arrangement such that the dissolution of said naproxen occurs independently of said triptan
2
the tablet of claim 1 wherein said naproxen is in the form of naproxen_sodium between 200_and_600 mg. ¡¬183_patent col.18 ll.30-39
the court construed the phrase` substantially all of said triptan is in a first_layer of said tablet and substantially all of said naproxen is in a second separate_layer' as meaning` [ a ] t least 90 % and preferably greater than 95 % of the total_triptan_present in the tablet is included within one distinct_layer and at least 90 % and preferably greater than 95 % of the naproxen_present in the tablet is included within a second_distinct_layer'
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 809
the parties agreed that the claim_term` dissolution of said naproxen occurs independently of said triptan' means` [ d ] issolution of naproxen.. and triptan from the multilayer_tablet.. occurs in the same *1159 amount of time_¡Ó 10 % as when the same_amount of naproxen.. and triptan are given separately'

d. procedural history
based on the anda filings pozen filed suit against appellants for infringement of the ¡¬499 ¡¬458 and ¡¬183_patent s and asked for a permanent_injunction against appellants from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united_states their anda_products until the patents-in-suit expire
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 799
the lawsuit triggered a 30-month stay of fda approval for appellants andas
id

following the claim_construction hearing the district_court conducted a five-day bench_trial regarding pozens infringement claims and appellants noninfringement invalidity and unenforceability defenses and counterclaims
the district_court held in part that the patents were not invalid because they were neither anticipated nor obvious in light of the prior_art that appellants anda_products infringed the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s and that par and drls anda_products infringed the ¡¬183_patent
id
furthermore the district_court held that the ¡¬499_patent_claims asserted were not invalid due to lack of written description
id.at 821-22
accordingly the district_court enjoined par alphapharm and drl from making or selling their respective anda_products
id.at 826
par alphapharm and drl filed a timely appeal.3 we have jurisdiction over the appeals pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
a
standard of review
this court reviews judgments of the district_court after a bench_trial` for errors of law and clearly erroneous findings of fact'
zenon envtl. inc. v. u.s. filter corp. 506_f.3d_1370 1377 fed.cir.2007 citations and internal_quotation_marks omitted

appellants challenge the validity of the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s in light of four prior_art_references.4 appellants also challenge the validity of the ¡¬183_patent in light of the ¡¬499_patent and prior_art.5 appellants ask this court to hold the ¡¬499_patent invalid for lack of written description
additionally appellants challenge the district_courts infringement determination as to the ¡¬183_patent
we address each argument in turn

b. invalidity
1
the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s are not obvious
a party asserting invalidity must present clear and convincing_evidence to *1160 overcome a patents presumption of validity
35 u.s.c.¡± 282 ; microsoft_corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship -- - u.s. -- -- 131_s.ct._2238 2245 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011)
a patent claim is invalid as obvious` whenthe differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art..` ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 406 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) quoting 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a
to determine if a patent is obvious the district_court looks to 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 differences between the prior_art and the claims ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 secondary considerations such as commercial success and failure of others
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)`
'obviousness is a question of law reviewed de novo based upon underlying factual questions which are reviewed for clear_error following a bench_trial
`` aventis pharma deutschland gmbh v. lupin ltd. 499_f.3d_1293 1300 fed.cir.2007 quoting alza corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 464_f.3d_1286 1289 fed.cir.2006

the district_court found that the prior_art_references did not invalidate the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s. specifically the district_court reasoned that the references did not separately or combined` teach or suggest the simultaneous_administration of sumatriptan and naproxen
nor.. otherwise disclose to one of ordinary_skill in the art that the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen produces a longer lasting efficacy reducing migraine_relapse compared to the administration of naproxen or sumatriptan alone'
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 819

as an initial matter par argues that the district_court erred because it failed to apply the term` concomitant_administration' to include simultaneous and sequential_administration as it had been construed
if the district_court had applied the terms as construed par asserts it would have found the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s invalid because the prior_art showed concomitant_administration

within the context of the claim_language the district_court properly applied its claim_construction
in its obviousness analysis the district_court only referred directly to whether the references disclosed` simultaneous_administration' rather than using the broader term` concomitant_administration'
see pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 814-19
the district_court construed the term` concomitantly administering' in the ¡¬499_patent_claims as simultaneous administration ; or administration of a second_drug for migraine_relief while a first_drug for migraine_relief is present in a therapeutically effective amount ; or administration of a 5-ht agonist and nsaid such that the effective plasma levels of the nsaid will be present in a subject from about one hour to about 12-24 hours after the onset of migraine or onset of precursor symptoms of a migraine
j.a.2554
the district_court construed the term` concomitantly administering' in the ¡¬458_patent claims as` [ g ] iven in close enough temporal proximity to allow their individual therapeutic effects to overlap'
j.a.2555
none of the parties contested the claim_construction
before the bench_trial the parties agreed that the claim_terms` unit_dose form'` unit_doses' and` unit_dosage_form s' in both the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s meant` single_drug_administration_entity ies'
every asserted claim in the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s contains the` unit_dose' limitation
see ¡¬499_patent col.14 *1161 ll.1-15 ; ¡¬ 458 patent col.12 ll.29-45
when considering the claim_language as a whole the term` unit_dose' necessarily limits concomitant_administration to mean simultaneous_administration because a single_drug_administration_entity can not be administered in any other fashion
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1314 fed.cir.2005 en banc` [ t ] he context in which a term is used in the asserted claim can be highly instructive`
therefore the district_court properly limited its analysis of the prior_art to whether the references taught simultaneous_administration of naproxen and sumatriptan

appellants further argue that the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s should be invalid as obvious in light of the prior_art asserting that references parma saadah patient_records from henry_ford_hospital or catarci alone or in combination teach a` concomitant_administration' of sumatriptan and naproxen to treat migraines
if the district_court had followed the case law and applied the claim_construction appellants contend it would have found both the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s invalid
we consider each reference in turn

i
the parma reference
the district_court determined that the parma_reference does not render the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s obvious
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 815-16
we agree
parma is an epidemiological survey assessing various migraine treatments entitled` the treatment of migraine a study in general_medicine
`` 6 one of the tables labeled` table_vi
combinations 2 drugs' listed` fans + sumatriptan' fans is the italian abbreviation for nsaids among fifteen other drug combinations for the treatment of migraines
another table labeled` table_viii
'unsatisfactory treatments' lists percentages of patients unsatisfied with various monotherapy treatments ; included in that list is` sumatriptan'

j.a.242119
appellants expert testified that parma teaches simultaneous_administration of various_drug_combinations and someone skilled in the art would look at` table_viii
'unsatisfactory treatments' and be motivated to either administer another_agent or administer a combination_therapy
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 816
the district_court gave more weight to pozens expert who testified that a person skilled in the art would have interpreted parma to disclose a sequential_administration of various_drug_combinations
id
as the tables reproduced above illustrate parma revealed the types of treatments used and documented the number of unsatisfactory treatments reported
parma only specifies the unsatisfactory results of monotherapy treatment in table_viii ; it does not indicate the relative successes of various combination treatments listed in table_vi.7 furthermore the district_court found that parma does not disclose anything about the combination of` fans + sumatriptan' in particular reducing migraine_relapse *1163 or producing longer lasting efficacy nor does it disclose the dosage of the combination treatment
id
although the district_court abused its discretion by admitting the tognoni_declaration see supra 1161_n._6 it was harmless error there was not clear and convincing_evidence that the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s are obvious over the parma_reference

ii
the saadah reference
the saadah_reference is a 1992 report entitled` abortive_migraine_therapy with oral_naproxen_sodium plus metoclopramide plus ergotamine_tartrate with caffeine'
it discloses the simultaneous delivery of several components ergotamine which is a 5-ht agonist that at the time was a widely used anti-migraine agent ; metoclopramide and caffeine to reduce nausea and improve` gastric emptying' which in turn leads to better absorption of anti-migraine agents ; and naproxen for its pain and inflammation reduction effects

par argues that another article n.h. raskins` acute and prophylactic_treatment of migraine practical_approaches and pharmacologic_rationale'` raskin' shows sumatriptan has beneficial effects on nausea and can be used instead of ergotamine to treat migraines eliminating the need for a concurrent antiemetic.8 therefore appellants contend a person of ordinary_skill in the art would reasonably expect to successfully substitute sumatriptan for ergotamine both 5-ht agonists in the treatment_plan disclosed by saadah
furthermore appellants contend that in substituting sumatriptan for ergotamine there would no longer be a need for antiemetics so metoclopramide and caffeine would be unnecessary
accordingly appellants assert saadah and raskin together teach the simultaneous_administration of sumatriptan and naproxen rendering the ¡¬ 499 and ¡¬458_patent s obvious

pozen contends that a person of ordinary_skill in the art motivated to substitute sumatriptan for ergotamine would remove not only metoclopramide and caffeine from the treatment_plan but also naproxen because sumatriptan was recognized to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects
therefore pozen argues the formulation would result in sumatriptan monotherapy

the district_court held that after reading saadah it is not obvious that one could substitute sumatriptan for ergotamine and remove metoclopramide and caffeine as unnecessary
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 817
we agree
saadah disclosed each drug as having a specific purpose and even though raskin teaches that antiemetics are unnecessary with sumatriptan raskin does not provide the motivation to a skilled_artisan to substitute one agent in place of three
nor does saadah teach the remaining efficacy limitations since it gives no reason to assume that an entirely different combination of agents would have the same success as the combination disclosed nor does it disclose the combination_therapy has any added benefits over any of the components given individually
see crocs inc. v. int l trade comm n 598_f.3d_1294 1309 fed.cir.2010` even if the [ patent at issue ] were a combination of known elements according to their established functions.. it yields more than predicable results' and thus is non-obvious
the district_court did not clearly err in determining the scope of saadah and raskin
accordingly as the district_court held the saadah_reference does not *1164 render the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art

iii
the henry ford patient records
appellants present two patient_records from the henry ford clinic in detroit michigan showing doctors prescribed a daily_dose of naproxen as a prophylactic treatment and sumatriptan for treating acute_migraines
appellants argue that because the two agents would be working in the body at the same_time even if taken separately they are concomitantly administered
additionally appellants contend that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would expect a daily_dose of naproxen to have the same effectiveness as a single dose of naproxen taken when needed because concentration of the drug in the blood would be the same or higher
therefore appellants assert that when sumatriptan is taken in addition to a daily_dose of naproxen the combination of the two drugs would have the same effect as when the two drugs are given simultaneously

dr. ramadan who treated the patients at the clinic testified that he did not recall ever prescribing or giving a patient sumatriptan and naproxen simultaneously
furthermore the henry_ford_records do not suggest that it produced longer lasting efficacy or reduced migraine_relapse
at least one of the patients prescriptions was soon altered to sumatriptan and an antidepressant suggesting the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen did not work to relieve migraine_symptoms
accordingly the district_court did not err in its determination of the scope of the teachings of the henry_ford_records ; we hold that the patient_records do not render the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s obvious

iv
the catarci reference
the catarci_reference is a case report entitled` ergotamine-induced_headache can be sustained by sumatriptan_daily_intake'
catarci describes a single patient who developed ergotamine-induced headaches and subsequently replaced ergotamine with daily administration of sumatriptan
sumatriptan effectively alleviated the patients daily migraines but did not relieve her constant mild headache
catarci discloses that the patient was subsequently taken off of sumatriptan and nsaids were` prescribed both on a daily basis and when required'
catarci discloses that treating the patients acute migraine attacks with either nsaid or sumatriptan was not beneficial
instead the patient resumed taking a daily_dose of sumatriptan in addition to acupuncture and successfully treated acute_migraines with additional sumatriptan
finally catarci concludes that acupuncture is beneficial` in treating drug-induced daily headache'
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 814 internal_citations and quotations omitted

appellants argue that catarci shows a concomitant_administration of sumatriptan and naproxen was used to treat migraines as evidenced by the patients prescription of a daily nsaid as a prophylactic with sumatriptan used as needed

the district_court did not clearly err in finding that catarci does not teach a combination of sumatriptan and naproxen provided migraine_relief
rather catarci concludes that the only effective treatment for this patient was sumatriptan and acupuncture
the district_court determined that catarci discourages combining sumatriptan and naproxen to achieve the claimed efficacy benefits teaching away from the invention
id
; see in re gurley 27_f.3d_551 553 fed.cir.1994 a reference teaches away when` a person of ordinary_skill upon reading the reference would be discouraged from following the *1165 path set out in the reference or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by the applicant
`` ; see also spectralytics inc. v. cordis corp. 649_f.3d_1336 1343 fed.cir.2011 explaining that a jury could find that prior_art taught away from one solution because all prior_art taught a different solution
for the reasons given by the district_court we agree that the catarci_reference does not render the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s obvious

v. conclusion regarding prior_art
we agree with the district_court that the prior_art would not have provided one of ordinary_skill with motivation to combine sumatriptan and naproxen in order to benefit from longer lasting efficacy as compared to when either agent is taken alone
appellants failed to rebut the presumption of validity afforded issued patents by clear and convincing_evidence
35 u.s.c.¡± 282 ; microsoft_corp. 131 s.ct.at 2245 ; see pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1361 fed.cir.2007` [ t ] he burden falls on the challenger of the patent to show by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art_references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so`
therefore the prior_art_references do not render the ¡¬499 and ¡¬458_patent s obvious

2
the ¡¬183_patent is not invalid for obviousness
par asserts as it did before the district_court that the ¡¬183_patent is obvious in light of the ¡¬499_patent combined with bandelin and/or knowledge of a person of ordinary_skill in the art
par argues the prior_art taught that naproxen has very low solubility in acidic environments like the stomach which would impede the dissolution of sumatriptan when the two are administered together in a single unit_dose
therefore a person of ordinary_skill in the art would use a multilayer_tablet which was well known to resolve the physical incompatibility between sumatriptan and naproxen
additionally par contends that the district_court failed to apply the correct construction of` independent_dissolution' by using the narrow definition in its invalidity_analysis when a plain and ordinary definition of the term which par argues the district_court used to find infringement would render the claim obvious

the district_court explained that although the references submitted by par are different than what was before the pto during prosecution the content of the references and the arguments made are the same.9 pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 820
the district_court reasoned that considering the record and the arguments

it was not obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art to formulate the naproxen_sodium and sumatriptan into a bilayer configuration
while multilayer_tablets were commonly used pozens dosage_forms of naproxen_sodium and sumatriptan were not obvious
nor do the references render obvious the specific_tablet_architecture as pozen argued to the pto and claimed in the ¡¬183_patent
accordingly defendants failed to rebut the ¡¬183_patents presumption of validity by clear and convincing_evidence
id.at 821 citation omitted
par concedes that using a` narrow' interpretation of the *1166 term` independent_dissolution' does not invalidate the ¡¬183_patent
we agree
par contends that the district_court improperly used a different construction of` independent_dissolution' in its infringement_analysis and invalidity_analysis
par argues that the district_courts infringement_analysis was conducted under the plain and ordinary_meaning of the independent_dissolution_limitation whereas the validity analysis uses a narrower definition
id
however par fails to explain the` plain and ordinary_meaning' of independent_dissolution and identify how it differs from the` narrow' meaning
in its infringement_analysis the district_court construed` independent_dissolution' as that term is defined in the ¡¬183_patent and does not appear to define that term in its invalidity_analysis any differently.10 regardless of what definition is applied appellants failed to rebut the presumption of validity afforded issued patents by clear and convincing_evidence
the district_court correctly held that the ¡¬183_patent was not obvious

3
the ¡¬499_patent is not invalid for lack of written description
appellants argue that the district_court erred in finding claim 15 of the ¡¬499_patent not invalid because the limitations` therapeutic_package'` finished pharmaceutical_container' and` said container further containing or comprising labeling directing the use of said package in the treatment of migraine' lack adequate written description in the specification
appellants assert that the terms were added during prosecution and that although the exact term need not be recited` the specification must contain an equivalent description of the claimed subject_matter' and there was no description of these limitations

the district_court reasonably found that one skilled in the art would understand the meaning of` therapeutic_package' and` finished pharmaceutical_container'

c. the district_court did not err in finding that appellants anda products infringe the ¡¬183_patent

*1168 the district_court found that par and drls anda_products infringed claim 2 of the ¡¬183_patent under the doctrine of equivalents
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 812
on appeal the appellants challenge the district_courts findings that the appellants anda_products meet the` independent_dissolution' limitation and the` substantially all' limitation
we address each in turn

1
the` independent dissolution' limitation
the parties agreed that the limitation` dissolution of said naproxen occurs independently of said triptan' as recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬183_patent means` [ d ] issolution of naproxen.. and triptan from the multilayer_tablet.. occurs in the same_amount of time_¡Ó 10 % as when the same_amount of naproxen.. and triptan are given separately' as it was described in the patent_specification
j.a.653 ; ¡¬183_patent col.2 ll.48-54
based on the evidence presented the district_court found` pozen has shown by a preponderance of the evidence the accused anda_products achieve independent_dissolution'
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 811-12

relying upon pars fda filings and expert_testimony presented at trial the district_court found that pars anda_product performs the same_function in the same_way to achieve the same_results and therefore satisfies the independent_dissolution_limitation under the doctrine of equivalents
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 810
pozens expert noted that pars anda_product was specifically formulated to achieve complete and independent_dissolution
j.a
6029
moreover in its anda par represented to the fda that the sumatriptan and naproxen in its anda_product dissolves completely and independently from each other
j.a
157587 ; j.a
157602 ; j.a
158055.12

the district_court similarly found that drls anda_product achieves independent_dissolution` by the way it formulates and manufactures the tablets'
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 810
relying upon the parties anda disclosures and expert_testimony the district_court found that` substantially all the triptan is segregated and separated into the equivalent of a first_distinct_layer in an equivalent_side-by-side_arrangement and this achieves the result of independent_dissolution'
id.at 811
moreover the district_court found` drls testing of its anda_product confirms its independent_dissolution'
id.13

notwithstanding the evidence presented at trial appellants argue that pozen did not prove independent_dissolution because there is no evidence on the record that the comparison required by the ¡¬183_patent was ever undertaken
specifically appellants contend that there is no proof that the independent_dissolution achieved by the anda_products was compared to dissolution rates of the same_amount of naproxen or sumatriptan alone
appellants *1169 thus ask this court to find the district_court erred by not requiring any proof that the active_agents in their anda_products achieved dissolution in about the same_time ¡Ó 10 % it would take for either of the active_agents to achieve dissolution when taken alone

the district_court did not clearly err in finding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because the record contains sufficient_evidence that the independent_dissolution requirement of the ¡¬183_patent was met
in assessing equivalents the court considers whether` the accused product [ s ] perform [ ] substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way with substantially the same_result as each claim_limitation of the patented_product'
crown_packaging_tech. 559 f.3d at 1312
although there is no direct evidence comparing the rate of dissolution of the anda_products to that of the agents individually no such actual comparison was necessary
under the doctrine of equivalents analysis pozen need only show that the anda_products performed the same_function in the same_way to achieve the same_result as the claimed elements of the ¡¬183_patent
par and drl provided expert_testimony to show that the sumatriptan dissolves completely and independently from the naproxen and that the naproxen dissolves completely and independently from the sumatriptan in their anda_products
also there is probative evidence from pars anda and comparison of drls anda_products dissolution_profile showing that their sumatriptan and naproxen dissolve completely and independently from another
as a result appellants offer no basis for setting aside the district_courts finding
indeed there is sufficient_evidence showing that logically if the agents dissolve in the same_way they would if the other_agent was not present their dissolution takes the same_amount of time it would taken when given separately
thus the district_court did not clearly err in relying on pozens expert_testimony and concluding that appellants anda_products meet the` independent_dissolution' limitation as recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬183_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

2
infringement of the` substantially all' limitation
claim 1 of the ¡¬183_patent requires` substantially all of said triptan is in the first_layer of said tablet and substantially all of said naproxen is in a second separate_layer'
¡¬183_patent col.18 ll.30-39
the district_court construed this phrase as` at least 90 % and preferably greater than 95 % of the total_triptan_present in the tablet is included within one distinct_layer and at least 90 % and preferably greater than 95 % of the naproxen_present in the tablet is included within a second_distinct_layer'
pozen_inc. v. par pharm. inc. 719_f.supp.2d_718 734 e.d.tex.2010
it is undisputed that the first_layer of pars anda_tablet` contains 100 % of the tablets sumatriptan along with 15 % of the tablets naproxen with the remaining 85 % of the naproxen in the second_layer
drls anda_tablet has 100 % of the tablets naproxen and 15 % of the tablets sumatriptan in the first_layer with the remaining 85 % of the sumatriptan in the second_layer'
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 809

i
the doctrine of equivalents can apply to the` substantially all' limitation
the district_court recognized that the claim_construction of the term` substantially all' provided specific percentages but stated that` absent more limiting language in the intrinsic record' the doctrine of equivalents can be applied to find infringement where the accused value is insubstantially different from the claimed value
id
( quoting adams_respiratory therapeutics *1170 inc. v. perrigo co. 616_f.3d_1283 1292 fed.cir.2010 ; see also u.s. philips corp. v. iwasaki elec co. 505_f.3d_1371 1378 fed.cir.2007 holding that despite a claimed concentration range the doctrine of equivalents can still be applied

par argues that the district_court improperly treated the claim_term` substantially all' as a precise quantity entitled to the doctrine of equivalents when it is really a` fuzzy' quantitative limitation not entitled to equivalents
par asserts that the word` substantially' was used to capture values lower than 100 % indeed the district_court construed the term to include any amount as low as 90 % and par contends pozen should not reach below 90 %` to encompass equivalents of equivalents'
cohesive techs. inc. v. waters corp. 543_f.3d_1351 1372 fed.cir.2008

drl argues that the district_court erred in granting pozen a range of equivalency for the ¡¬183_patent beyond the scope of equivalency determined through claim_construction
drl asserts that in the cases the district_court cites the degree to which the accused product fell outside the specifically claimed range was miniscule in comparison to the amount their anda_product falls outside of the claimed range.14 here drl contends sumatriptan only makes up 85 % of one layer ; 5 % less than the minimum 90 % set forth in the construction of the term` substantially all'

indeed this court has stated that where` a patentee has brought what would otherwise be equivalents of a limitation into the literal scope of the claim the doctrine of equivalents is unavailable to further broaden the scope of the claim'
cohesive techs. 543 f.3d at 1372
`` [ a ] ll claim_limitations are not entitled to an equal scope of equivalents
whether the result of the all limitations rule prosecution history estoppel or the inherent narrowness of the claim_language many limitations warrant little if any range of equivalents'
moore u.s.a. inc. v. standard_register_co. 229_f.3d_1091 1106 fed.cir.2000 internal_citations omitted

however although the claim_language itself is a qualitative measure the claim_construction pulls directly from the specification to give the term` substantially all' a quantitative definition specifically` at least 90 % and preferably greater than 95 %' ¡¬183_patent col.2 ll.62-65 and this court has previously concluded that the doctrine of equivalents is not foreclosed with respect to claimed ranges see adams_respiratory 616 f.3d at 1291-92
in kemin_foods the court construed` substantially free from other_carotenoids' to mean` significantly less than 10 % of other_carotenoids' based in part on the specification stating that` [ g ] enerally the concentration of other_carotenoids in the starting material should be 10 % or less'
kemin_foods l.c
v. pigmentos vegetales del centro s.a. de c.v. 464_f.3d_1339 1349 fed.cir.2006
the court determined that because kemin did not argue that` significantly less than 10 %' has a precise upper limit a reasonable_person could determine that a concentration of 6.14 % -9.86 % does not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
id
similarly in this case pozen never stated that` at least 90 % and preferably greater than 95 %' should be an absolute floor
under the doctrine of equivalents a *1171 tablet_layer with 85 % of the agent can be fairly characterized as an insubstantial change from a tablet_layer with 90 % of the agent

ii
appellants anda_products infringe the` substantially all' limitation under the doctrine of equivalents
turning now to the district_courts analysis of infringement of the` substantially all' limitation we review the district_courts findings of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents for clear_error
conoco 460 f.3d at 1357
the district_court stated that the multilayer_tablet claimed in the ¡¬183_patent requires` substantially all of the naproxen and triptan [ to be ] segregated and separated for the purpose of independent_dissolution'
pozen 800 f.supp.2d at 810
the parties experts agreed that the function was to have` separate distinct_layers of sumatriptan and naproxen
the way in which this function is achieved is by formulating the sumatriptan and naproxen in different manners to create physical barriers
the result is that substantially naproxen is separated from the [ sumatriptan ] thereby providing independent_dissolution'
id

the district_court found that pars anda_product performs essentially the same_function by segregating the naproxen and sumatriptan into two layers
id
this is achieved by formulating them differently specifically by using a polymer_binder to form 15 % of the naproxen into granules which are added to the sumatriptan layer
id
the result is that one layer has 100 % of the sumatriptan with 15 % of the naproxen and another_layer has the remaining 85 % of the naproxen substantially all separated and segregated into two layers
id
therefore the district_court determined pars anda_product performs the same_function in the same_way and achieves the same_result and satisfies all of the limitations of the ¡¬183_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

the district_court also found that drls anda_product performs the same_function of achieving separate distinct_layers by segregating the triptan and naproxen
id
this is achieved by granulating 15 % of the sumatriptan with a polymer_binder and then spraying it on the naproxen which has been granulated with a polymer_binder as well ; the remaining 85 % of the sumatriptan forms the other_layer
id
`` thus substantially all the triptan is segregated and separated into the equivalent of a first_distinct_layer in an equivalent_side-by-side_arrangement and this achieves the result of independent_dissolution'
id.at 811
therefore the district_court determined drls anda_product performs the same_function in the same_way and achieves the same_result and satisfies all of the limitations of the ¡¬183_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

appellants argue that their anda_products do not achieve separate distinct_layers because one of the layers has both agents
however their products contain a bilayer_tablet with 100 % of one agent in one layer and 85 % of the other_agent in the other_layer
we determine as the district_court did that this structure is insubstantially different from a bilayer_tablet with 90 % of the total therapeutic agent present in the tablet included in a single layer

appellants contend that their products are admixtures which pozen specifically disclaimed during the ¡¬183_patent prosecution
drl argues that the district_court improperly limited pozens disclaimer to admixtures that achieve independent_dissolution when it really disclaimed admixtures in general
we agree that pozen did *1172 in fact disclaim admixtures when it stated before the pto the present claims require that naproxen and [ sumatriptan ] be in a tablet in which they are segregated from one another in a` side by side_arrangement' and in which their dissolution occurs independently of one another
the claims are limited to one very specific_tablet_architecture
among the dosage_forms falling outside the claims are admixtures ; any dosage_forms other than tablets ; tablets in which one drug is in a core and surrounded by a layer or coating containing the second_drug ; and tablets containing multiple drug release pellets or microparticles
j.a.240667
however the appellants anda_products are not admixtures i.e
substances with blended or mixed ingredients because substantially all of the agents are separated and segregated into two distinct_layers as explained above

based on the evidence above the district_court did not clearly err in finding that pars anda_products and drls anda_products met the` substantially all' limitation of the ¡¬183_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

conclusion
appellants failed to rebut the presumption of validity of issued patents thus we affirm the district_courts holding that the ¡¬499 ¡¬458 and ¡¬183_patent s are not invalid
additionally the appellants provided no basis for unsettling the district_courts finding on infringement
accordingly we affirm the district_courts injunction enjoining appellants from making using importing selling or offering to sell their anda_products or inducing others to do so until the expiration of the ¡¬499 ¡¬458 and ¡¬183_patent s

affirmed

clevenger circuit_judge dissenting-in-part
i join the courts opinion in all respects but one
the district_court erred in finding infringement of claim 2 of the ¡¬183_patent under the doctrine of equivalents and the court today errs in sustaining the judgment of the district_court on this issue

claim 2 calls for a multilayer_pharmaceutical_tablet comprising naproxen and a triptan wherein` substantially all of said triptan is in a first_layer of said tablet and substantially all of said naproxen is in a second separate_layer'
this claim_language begged the question of how much by volume of both naproxen and triptan less than 100 % is` substantially all'
the district_court answered the question construing` substantially all' without objection to mean' [ a ] t least 90 % and preferably greater than 95 % of the total_triptan_present in the tablet is included within one distinct_layer and at least 90 % and preferably greater than 95 % of the naproxen_present in the tablet is included within a second_distinct_layer'
the accused products do not literally meet the` substantially all' limitation
that is why the patentee could not assert literal_infringement of claim 2 and why he was forced to rely on the doctrine of equivalents to establish infringement
the actual composition of the claimed and accused tablets with regard to the` substantially all' limitation is shown on the following chart

*1173 as shown in the table above each of the par and drl products includes one more or less` pure' layer meeting the` substantially all' limitation as defined by the district_court
pars product has substantially all the required triptan in one layer along with 15 % of the tablets naproxen but the second par layer has less than 90 % of naproxen
so the question is whether 85 % of naproxen is equivalent to 90 % when` substantially all' means` at least 90 % and preferably greater than 95 %'

drls product is also designed to avoid the` substantially all' limitation
it has substantially all the required naproxen in one layer along with 15 % of the triptan but the second drl layer has only 85 % of the total triptan in the product
so again the question is whether 85 % can be` substantially all' given the district_courts construction of the limitation

pozen candidly admits in its brief to this court that the district_court never directly addressed the question of whether a layer containing 85 % of a necessary_ingredient is an equivalent of a layer containing at least 90 % and preferably 95 % of the necessary_ingredient
and pozen says it does not argue that 85 % can be a numerical equivalent of 90 %
instead pozen argues that the district_court properly elided the numeric equivalence issue by asking only if the accused products had an` equivalent of a second_layer' which could be viewed as containing substantially all of the required ingredient
pozen and the district_court both see the` substantially all' limitation as requiring the tablet to have one more or less pure_layer and not an actual second_layer but an` equivalent' second_layer that could be said to be equivalent to a more or less pure_layer even if it failed to contain substantially all of the required ingredient
in short pozen and the district_court used the notion of an equivalent_layer simply to avoid answering the question of whether 85 % is the equivalent of 90 % or preferably 95 %

even if the equivalent_layer notion has merit it still can not be disconnected from the language of the claim
the equivalent_layer would in any event have to be the equivalent of a more or less pure_layer i.e. one with at least 90 % and preferably 95 % of the required ingredient in it
how can a layer with only 85 % of the necessary_ingredient in it be an equivalent of a layer with at least 90 % and preferably 95 % of the required ingredient in it ?

the district_court with no contest from pozen recognized that` substantially all' inherently contains a range from something less than 100 % up to 100 %
rather than leave the inherent equivalent range embedded in the claim_language the district_court put boundaries on the claim_language
`` substantially all' means at least 90 % and preferably 95 %
the defendants cite our precedent including moore *1174 u.s.a. inc. v. standard_register_co. 229_f.3d_1091 fed.cir.2000 for the proposition that the spread from 85 % to 90 % is too great to be an equivalent
pozen appreciates the force of those cases but argues they are inapplicable here because the district_court did not answer the numeric equivalence question but instead turned the infringement decision on a flawed layer equivalence notion

in my view the district_court erred by not asking itself if under claim 2 a layer viewed from the outside or from the inside can be equivalent if is numerically nonequivalent
it can not
the majority states that` a reasonable_person could determine that a tablet_layer with 85 % of the agent is within the scope of the doctrine of equivalents'
respectfully i disagree

at trial pozen presented and the district_court allowed into evidence a declaration from one of the coauthors of the parma_reference referred to as the` tognoni_declaration' which stated while my article speaks of [ combination_therapy ] of many pairs of drugs including nsaids and sumatriptan this is not meant as a reference to administering those two drugs at the same_time.. it refers to the common practice of that time of migraine patients taking drugs separately in sequence with a required gap in time between administrations of the drugs to determine the efficacy of the first_drug before trying additional drugs
j.a.158512
drl argues that the declaration is inadmissible as hearsay and irrelevant and in admitting it the district_court abused its discretion

the fifth_circuit reviews decisions to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion

`` the residual_hearsay_exception is to be used only rarely in truly exceptional cases'
united_states v. walker 410_f.3d_754 757 5th cir.2005 citations and internal_quotation_marks omitted
to admit evidence under the residual_hearsay_rule there must be at least circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness
id.at 758
the fifth_circuit has found there are equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness when the declaration is made under oath and the declarant is subject to the penalties of perjury the testimony was preserved on videotape and the witnesses were subject to cross-examination
id
here tognoni made a written statement under penalty of perjury but was never subjected to cross-examination which may be enough under fifth_circuit law to guarantee trustworthiness
however even if it is trustworthy this is not an exceptional case and thus does not warrant the residual_hearsay_exception

although the properties of the two agents were known independently parma does not give any indication that the combination of the two produced any benefit beyond those experienced when each agent is taken alone

to establish literal_infringement` every limitation set forth in a claim must be found in an accused product exactly'

pars anda states most of our experiments were targeted to match the in-vitro dissolution_profile of the individual brands
naproxen_sodium is poorly soluble in lower ph conditions and tends to form a gel like matrix and thereby retard the release of co-administered drugs
our primary objective is to develop a formulation having minimal effect of naproxen_sodium over sumatriptan succinate dissolution thereby having release profiles independent of each other in all the ph conditions.. j.a.157602

comparing drls dissolution_profile of its anda_product to table 7 in the ¡¬183_patent which shows the dissolution_profile of sumatriptan in a bilayer_tablet pozens expert dr. williams opined that the dissolution results in the table were almost the same as those in drls anda_product
