opinion
*1315 newman circuit_judge
mr. nouri e. hakim sued cannon_avent_group plc cannon_rubber_limited and avent_america inc. together` avent' in the united_states_district_court for the western_district of louisiana asserting infringement of hakims united states patents no._6321,931 the ¡¬931_patent and no._6357,620 the ¡¬620_patent by avents leak-resistant_drinking_cups
the district_court granted avents motions for summary_judgment that the ¡¬931_patent is not infringed and the ¡¬620_patent is invalid.1 we affirm these judgments

the ¡¬931_patent
the hakim inventions are for drinking_cups that prevent the spilling of liquid if the cup is tipped over
hakims patented cups have a valve through which fluid can pass when suction is applied by a person by way of a drinking_spout whereby the valve closes to seal the cup when a person is not drinking
the specification of the ¡¬931_patent describes the preferred_embodiment as having a dual sealing mechanism that provides an` extremely secure_seal' against spillage in accordance with the invention an improved cup construction and valve_assembly is provided which provides an extremely secure_seal against accidental liquid flow from the cup_spout
further to the invention a user places his or her mouth against the spout of the cup assembly to suck liquid out of the cup when desired
the act of sucking at the spout of the cup creates negative_pressure or a partial vacuum against a valve in the cup_spout causing the valve to invert or turn inside out either partially or totally thereby unblocking an opening such as an orifice or slit in the valve
once the opening is unblocked liquid can flow freely through the valve and spout
in contrast when not in use the valve sits in a resting closed_position with the valve pressed against the center_seal-off thereby sealing off the opening or slit in the valve_assembly
thus in its relaxed_state with no negative_pressure applied the valve sits in a closed_position with the fluid_opening sealed by the center_seal-off
moreover in accordance with the dual valve nature of the device in the preferred_embodiment an adjacent valve similarly seals when no negative_pressure is applied thereby blocking off the air vents in the cover of the cup and further preventing the possibility of fluid flow
consequently the closed_position provides an extremely secure_seal against fluid leakage such that inadvertent spills or even deliberate attempts to force liquid outside of the cup such as by turning the cup upside down or shaking the cup are ineffective
¡¬931_patent col. 1 line 51 to col. 2 line 10

during patent prosecution hakim described his distinctions from the cited references as follows thus two separate mechanisms are both used to close off the passage of liquid through the valve when not in use
the first mechanism involves an inverting flexible_valve_material which has a slit therein and responds to suction
the second mechanism involves the use of a blocking element which is impenetrable to the passage of liquid
the slit sits against the blocking element sealing or blocking off the slit to yet further prevent the passage of liquid through the valve
... by providing both the elastomeric member with a slit and a blocking element *1316 a sealing mechanism is provided which reduces spillage beyond that of either mechanism alone
none of the references cited in the office action [ robbins iii bachman and belcastro ] teach or suggest such a no-spill mechanism having a slit sitting against a blocking element such as is recited in all of the pending claims
¡¬931 application response oct._2,_2000 emphases added
thus during prosecution the presence of the slit in the flexible_valve_material was emphasized as distinguishing all of the claims from the cited references

avents accused drinking_cup has a valve with a flexible_diaphragm having a central opening but the opening is not a slit that opens and closes but simply a hole in the diaphragm
the diaphragm rests against a plastic mount that has a conical_head that seals the hole
upon suction by a person seeking to drink the diaphragm is lifted off the conical_head exposing the hole and permitting fluid to flow from the cup to the drinking_spout

the district_court held on summary_judgment that avents device did not infringe the ¡¬931_claims based on the claim_construction that limited the ¡¬931_claims to a sealing mechanism that includes a flexible_valve_material or diaphragm having a slit
hakim i at *1` for the reasons contained in the report and recommendation of the magistrate_judge previously filed herein and after a de novo review of the entire record and the written objections filed herein and concurring with the magistrate_judges findings under the applicable law' ; summary_judgment was granted
mr. hakim argues that the claim_construction is excessively constricted and that all of the ¡¬931_claims do not require a slit that opens and closes with pressure for claims 1_and_2 use the word` opening' not` slit' for the aperture in the diaphragm
claim 1 is as follows 1
an apparatus for use in a no-spill drinking_cup said apparatus comprising a valve holder such valve holder comprising at least one valve and a blocking element said valve comprising a flexible_material said blocking element comprising an area of material which is impenetrable to the flow of liquid said valve further comprising an opening through said flexible_material said valve having a resting position wherein said flexible_material sits with said opening against said blocking element such that said valve is closed to the passage of liquid through said valve said valve moving into an open_position for the passage of liquid through said valve upon the application of negative air pressure to the top of said valve said open_position being a position wherein said flexible member comprising said opening lifts off of said blocking element
( emphasis added
the word` opening' was placed in claims 1_and_2 when hakim filed a continuation_application after receiving a notice of allowance for claims wherein the word` slit' appeared instead of` opening'
the filing of the continuation was accompanied by an attorney letter stating that hakim was broadening claims 1_and_2 and an amendment changing` slit' to` opening' in claims 1_and_2
the continuation_claims were allowed without any comment or rejection by the examiner
however in construing the claims of the continuation patent the district_court held hakim to his arguments in the parent_application that the invention includes the presence of a slit in the flexible_material
the court stated` because hakim did not retract any of his arguments distinguishing the prior_art he is held to the restrictive claim_construction he argued during prosecution of the patent'
hakim i at *5 adopted magistrates report

*1317 hakim argues that the district_court improperly relied on the argument in the abandoned parent_application
hakim states that by re-filing the application with broader_claims he avoided any unnecessary restriction that may have crept into the prior prosecution
he states that he informed the examiner that the new_claims were broader than those previously allowed and that when the examiner allowed the new_claims without rejection there is a presumption that the examiner had assured himself of the patentability of the new_claims
see united states v. chemical foundation 272_u.s._1 14-15 47_s.ct._1 71_l.ed._131_(1926)` the presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers and in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties'
hakim states that he did what was appropriate when he flagged this change to assist the examiner and that the claims as granted should not be unnecessarily narrowed by the court

avent states that the totality of the prosecution_history nonetheless limits hakim to the embodiment with the slit for the magistrate_judge found` the prosecution_history makes perfectly clear that hakim specifically distinguished his invention from the prior_art by limiting it to an apparatus with both 1 a slit which closes when suction is not applied and 2 a second closure consisting of a blocking element which the slit rests against'
hakim i at *5 adopted magistrates report
avent states that this was and is the distinction from the prior_art and that the claims are properly limited to this feature whether they use the word` slit' or the word` opening'
avent stresses that when hakim wrote to the examiner that he was broadening the claims he did not specifically point out that he no longer intended to be limited to the specific mechanism that he had previously argued was the distinguishing feature of his invention

hakim points out that a patent applicant is not precluded from filing a continuation_application with broader_claims
it is recognized that an applicant can broaden as well as restrict his claims during the procedures of patent examination and that continuing applications may present broader_claims than were allowed in the parent
cf
symbol technologies inc. v. lemelson medical education & research found. 422_f.3d_1378 1385 fed.cir.2005` commonly and justifiably one might refile an application to add subject_matter in order to attempt to support broader_claims as the development of an invention progresses although entitlement to an earlier filing date for any claimed subject_matter may of course be necessary to avoid a statutory bar created by intervening events outlined in 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102_and_103
``

hakim had the right to refile the application and attempt to broaden the claims
see id.at 1385` one may also refile an application even in the absence of any of these reasons [ refiling an application in response to a requirement for restriction ; refiling in order to present evidence that may not have previously existed ; or refiling to support broader_claims as the development of an invention progresses ] provided that such refiling is not unduly successive or repetitive'
however an applicant can not recapture claim_scope that was surrendered or disclaimed
the district_court did not err in holding that the examiners action in allowing the continuation_claims without further prosecution was based on the prosecution argument in the parent
see omega engineering inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1324 fed.cir.2003` the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer is well established in supreme court precedent precluding patentees from recapturing through claim interpretation specific *1318 meanings disclaimed during prosecution'
( citing schriber-schroth co. v. cleveland trust co. 311_u.s._211 220-21 61_s.ct._235 85_l.ed._132_(1940) crawford v. heysinger 123_u.s._589 602-04 8_s.ct._399 31_l.ed._269_(1887) and goodyear dental vulcanite co. v. davis 102_u.s._222 227 26_l.ed._149_(1880)
although a disclaimer made during prosecution can be rescinded permitting recapture of the disclaimed scope the prosecution_history must be sufficiently clear to inform the examiner that the previous disclaimer and the prior_art that it was made to avoid may need to be re-visited
see springs window fashions lp v. novo indus. l.p. 323_f.3d_989 995 fed.cir.2003` the public notice function of a patent and its prosecution_history requires that a patentee be held to what he declares during the prosecution of his patent
a patentee may not state during prosecution that the claims do not cover a particular device and then change position and later sue a party who makes that same device for infringement
``

the district_court correctly ruled that the word` opening' is not correctly construed to eliminate the sealing mechanism provided by the slitted diaphragm
on this construction the summary_judgment of noninfringement of the ¡¬931_patent was correct and is affirmed

the ¡¬620_patent
the ¡¬620_patent also describes a valve containing a diaphragm with an opening but the opening surrounds a conical post protruding from the surface of the blocking element ; when suction is applied to the spout of the cup the diaphragm is lifted off of the blocking element permitting fluid to flow through the opening
hakim describes this invention as follows in the preferred_embodiment the application of negative_pressure to the top of the valve causes an opening in a portion of the valve to move up off of the base of a protruding member extending through that opening
once the opening is unblocked liquid can flow freely through the valve and spout
in contrast when not in use the valve sits in a resting closed_position with the opening pressed against the center_seal-off thereby sealing off the opening slit or orifice in the valve_assembly
thus in its relaxed_state with no negative_pressure applied the valve sits in a closed_position with the fluid_opening sealed by the center_seal-off
in the preferred_embodiment the protruding member extends through the opening in a male to female relationship such that the orifice sits tightly on the protruding member against the protruding members bottom portion and the center_seal-off or sealing members base
¡¬620_patent col. 1 line 51 to col. 2 line 9

the district_court granted summary_judgment that the claims of the ¡¬620_patent are invalid based on anticipation by italian patent no._594286 the it_¡¬286_patent
the it_¡¬286_patent was not before the united states examiner whereupon the district_court analyzed the reference to determine its relevance and effect

a. hakim argues that the district_court erred in invalidating the ¡¬620_patent without first construing the claims citing amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343_(fed.cir.2001) for the proposition that an invalidity analysis begins with the construction of the claims

claim construction is directed to claims or claim terms whose meaning is disputed as applied to the patentees invention in the context of the accused device
when there is no dispute as to the meaning of a term that could affect the disputed issues of the litigation` construction' may *1319 not be necessary
we are not told what alternative meanings are sought for terms that might affect validity of the claim or how claim` construction' would affect the issue of anticipation by the italian patent
hakims methodological challenge is without substance

b
`` anticipation' means that the claimed invention was previously known and that all of the elements and limitations of the claim are described in a single prior_art reference
see akzo n.v. v. u.s. int l trade comm n 808_f.2d_1471 1479 fed.cir.1986` under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 anticipation requires that each and every element of the claimed invention be disclosed in a prior_art reference'
the magistrate_judge found that the drinking_cup described in the it_¡¬286_reference and the drinking_cup in the ¡¬620_patent` are substantially identical in all material respects' explaining both inventions have a flexible valve_member or diaphragm a base and a protruding member or post called a peduncle in the it_¡¬286_patent
the post extends through a hole in the valve_member and when at rest in its closed_position the valve_member sits tightly around the lower portion of the post in both inventions
when a child sucks on the spout the valve_member moves up the post which allows liquid to flow through the hole in the valve_member
both the ¡¬620 and the ¡¬286_patent ed apparatuses operate in this manner
hakim_ii at *4

hakim argues that the district_court erred in deciding the factual issue of anticipation adversely on summary_judgment ; specifically the question of whether the it_¡¬286_reference describes a` closed_position'
hakim points out that each claim of his ¡¬620_patent requires a closed_position in which the valve blocks the passage of liquid and that the it_¡¬286_reference describes a valve that` produces hermetic sealing' i.e
that blocks the passage of air
hakim argues that a valve can be tight enough to block the passage of air but not strong enough to block the passage of liquid and that it can not be assumed that when the it ¡¬286 valve is closed it blocks the passage of liquid

the district_court rejected this argument pointing to the it ¡¬286 statement that its purpose is to prevent liquid from flowing when suction is not applied that is to block the passage of liquid in the closed_position
we discern no error in the district_courts analysis of the description of the device shown in the it ¡¬286 or the operation of the valve structure
we agree with the district_court that no reasonable jury could find other than that all of the limitations of the ¡¬620 claims are present in the it_¡¬286_device thereby anticipating the ¡¬620 invention

c. mr. hakim also argues that the district_court erred in failing to analyze anticipation on a claim-by-claim basis
in particular hakim argues that the court ignored the limitation of claim 12 that the flexible valve` begins to invert upon the application of negative_pressure'
it is correct that each claim must be considered separately and that the limitations in subordinate claims are relevant to determination of anticipation of those claims by a single reference
however the district_court did discuss the aspect of when the valve begins to invert finally hakim argues that unlike the it_¡¬286_device his device requires that the flexible member` invert' or` begin to invert' and he embarks on semantical gymnastics to create a distinction in the two devices
this is not as they say rocket science ; both of these extremely *1320 simple devices are made so that when a child sucks on the spout the flexible member flexes up on the post breaking the seal and allowing the flow of liquid
it matters not whether this movement is called inverting` beginning to invert' flexing sliding moving lifting or any other term denoting its movement
both devices allow the liquid to flow when suction moves the flexible_diaphragm from its` sealed' position on the post
hakim_ii at *5
hakim does not state that this analysis is incorrect ; he just asserts that this limitation was not separately addressed in the opinion
however the` begins to invert' limitation of claim 12 was indeed discussed
reversible error has not been shown on this ground

we affirm the district_courts conclusion that the ¡¬620 device is anticipated by the device in the it_¡¬286_patent and that the claims were correctly invalidated

hakims expert declaration
hakim argues that the district_court erred in striking his declaration offered as an expert and that his testimony provided evidence of the validity and correct interpretation of his patents
the court sustained the exclusion as follows a magistrate_judges non-dispositive order is reviewable under the clearly erroneous and contrary to law standard
28 u.s.c.¡± 636 b 1 a ; fed.r.civ.p
72 a ; castillo v. frank 70_f.3d_382 385-86 5th cir.1995
in his memorandum order granting the motion to strike the hakim declaration magistrate_judge kirk concluded that hakim failed to provide a timely expert report or to submit himself for deposition that expert testimony is not needed by the court in this case and that hakims testimony is self-serving biased and` of no assistance to the court in understanding thetechnology involved regarding the simple device at issue in this case'
this discretionary ruling is not grounds for reversal for we have not been shown how the trier of fact was led into error or could reasonably have reached a different decision had the inventors declaration been admitted
this evidentiary ruling was in accordance with the rules and is affirmed

affirmed
