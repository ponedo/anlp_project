opinion
michel circuit_judge
nupla corporation` nupla' appeals the judgment based on the decisions of the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california no._95-7992- r granting two motions for partial_summary_judgment in favor of ixl manufacturing company inc.` ixl' and dismissing the complaint as to all four of nuplas causes of action
the case was submitted for our decision following oral argument on january 27 1997
because we agree that 1 nuplas united states reissue patent no
re 32,364`364_patent` is invalid since the declaration submitted pursuant to 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.175 was insufficient as it addressed only one of three material_changes from the original_claims ; and 2 nuplas two registrations for the trademark_cush-n-grip u.s
supplemental reg
no._895244`244 trademark' and u.s
principal reg
no._1742,769`769 trademark' are invalid as a matter of law because the mark is generic we affirm

background
nupla is the exclusive licensee of the364 reissue_patent which was issued to inventor joseph a. carmien on february 24 1984
the invention is directed to tool_handles with flexible_cores that can be inserted into the tools
the flexible_core provides compressive support inside the handle and prevents buckling or collapse of the handle when the tool is subjected to high bending stress

the364_patent is a reissue of u.s._patent_no._4451,073`073_patent`
the original_patent contained a single independent_claim a flexible_core for insertion into a handle receiving socket of a hand tool said core comprising an elongated generally cylindrical body ; a plurality of grooves formed in said_body and spaced from one another
along said_body forming at least one socket_filler for bearing
compressive load in said handle receiving socket ; and
a flexible_shaft capable of bending to permit said core to conform to the
shape of said handle receiving socket

carmien filed a reissue_application deleting original_claims 1-5 and substituting for them reissue_application_claims 6-10 to change among other things the limitation` a plurality of grooves' to` at least one groove'
the reissue_application also added claims 11-19
his declaration filed pursuant to 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.175 explained that the original_patent contained an error in that its claims were too narrowly drawn to` a plurality of grooves' because of a mistake by the prosecuting patent attorney caused by the attorneys misunderstanding of instructions given by the inventor
during the reissue_examination the patent_examiner rejected all of the reissue_application_claims as unpatentable over u.s._patent_no._4301,109` the kain_patent' which relates to conveyor_idlers
the claims were further amended without a supplementary_declaration in response to this rejection and claims 6-19 were ultimately allowed

nupla is also the owner of the244 and769 trademark registrations each of which is for the mark cush-n-grip in connection with tool_handles and replacement_handle_kits

nupla filed a complaint against ixl on november 22 1995 for contributory infringement and inducing infringement of the364 reissue_patent by ixls manufacture and sale of tool_handles and replacement handles and for ixls infringement of the cush-n-grip_trademark based on ixls use of the name cushion-grip in the sale and advertising of ixls products

conroy v. reebok int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994
patents have a statutory presumption *193 of validity 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 1994 which can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence

i
the reissue_statute 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 1994 provides in relevant_part whenever any patent is through error without any deceptive_intention deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective specification or drawing or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he [ or she ] had a right to claim in the patent the commissioner shall.. reissue the patent for the invention disclosed in the original_patent and in accordance with a new and amended application for the unexpired part of the term of the original_patent
no new matter shall be introduced into the application for reissue
...
the provisions of this title relating to applications for patent shall be applicable to applications for reissue of a patent.. emphasis added

the reissue_regulations 37 c.f.r.¡±¡± 1.171-179 1996 require an applicant to file an oath or declaration with an application for reissue
the declaration must include 1 when the applicant verily believes the original_patent to be wholly or partly inoperative or invalid stating such belief and the reasons why
... 3 when it is claimed that such patent is inoperative or invalid` by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he [ or she ] had the right to claim in the patent' distinctly specifying the excess or insufficiency in the claims
... 5 particularly specifying the errors relied upon and how they arose or occurred
( 6 stating that said errors arose` without any deceptive_intention' on the part of the applicant
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.175 a 1996 emphasis added
our case law requires a reissue_application to include declarations` to specify every difference between the original and reissue_claims'
in re constant 827_f.2d_728 729 3_uspq2d_1479 1480 fed.cir.1987
in constant this court affirmed the decision of the united states patent and trademark office board of patent appeals and interferences` board' which affirmed the examiners rejection of a reissue_application on the ground that the applicant failed to comply with 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.175
there the appellant argued that the board erred in its interpretation of the regulation by requiring` every difference between the original and reissue_claims' to be specified
this court rejected that appeal because the declaration addressed only one type of change and` failed to address the remainingexcesses and insufficiencies as required by ¡± 1.175 a 3'
id
the court while noting that there was no implication that the manual of patent examining procedure` mpep' is binding on this court cited mpep ¡± 1444 which states now as it did then that` [ e ] very departure from the original_patent.. must be particularly and distinctly specified and supported in the original or a supplemental reissue oath or declaration under 37_c.f.r._1175'
mpep ¡± 1444 6th ed. rev.1 sept. 1995 ; constant 827 f.2d at 729 3 uspq2d at 1480
the court concluded that` [ a ] ppellant has failed to show any error of law in the boards application of rule 175 or in the rules promulgation'
constant 827 f.2d at 729 3 uspq2d at 1480

here the only declaration provided by the inventor1 with the reissue_application merely stated in relevant_part

i believe the original_patent to be partly inoperative or invalid because of error without any deceptive_intent on the part of the applicant by reason that i claimed less that [ sic ] i had a right to claim.... *194 because independent_claim 1 of my original_patent includes the language` a plurality of grooves formed in said_body and spaced from one another along said_body' at column 4 lines 38-39 i believe my patent to be partly inoperative or invalid
...
when i filed my original_patent application i intended only that` at least one socket_filler' be required
the fact that my independent_claim 1 requires a plurality of grooves to form that` at least one socket_filler' when it is clear that only one such groove is needed simply evidences a mere oversight or lack of foresight on my behalf
the requirement of a` plurality of grooves' was not needed at the time the original_application was filed nor did i intend that my invention be so limited
( emphasis added
although the declaration only explains one difference in scope between the original and reissue_claims there were actually three material differences in scope
first a limitation was changed from` a plurality of grooves' to` at least one groove' the` groove' limitation
the` groove' limitation is adequately explained by the declaration filed with the reissue_application
second there were added limitations to` a tool portion having a handle receiving socket' and` a handle received and secured within said handle receiving socket' the` tool' limitations
third there were still further added limitations to` said shaft having a diameter reduced from that of said_body to define a groove separating said at least one socket_filler from the remainder of said_body' and` said at least two portions of said_body being connected together by a flexible_shaft capable of bending to permit said core to conform to the shape of said handle receiving socket' the` shaft' limitations
neither the` tool' limitations nor the` shaft' limitations were addressed in the declaration
nor were any supplemental_declarations filed

every reissue_claim of the364_patent contains at least one new limitation absent from the originally issued claims that is not explained by the declaration
according to the statute these new_limitations must represent an error in the original_claims
reissue claims 6-10 contain the` tool' limitations and reissue_claims 11-19 contain both the` shaft' limitations and the` tool' limitations
nupla argues that the` tool' limitations were added during the prosecution of the reissue_application to overcome the rejection for obviousness in light of the kain_patent2 and were not to correct` errors' in the original_patent
therefore nupla argues a declaration to explain this additional limitation is unnecessary since there was no` error'

nupla misperceives the nature and scope of the errors covered by the reissue_statute and regulations
although the underclaiming error corrected by the addition of the` groove' limitation resulted from miscommunication between the inventor and the prosecuting attorney miscommunication is not the only kind of error contemplated by the statute
rather the` error' must only be the` claiming of more or less than he [ or she ] had a right to claim' for some excusable reason
35 u.s.c.¡± 251
leaving aside the excusability of the reason the essence of` error' addressable in the reissue_procedure is this overclaiming or underclaiming
when the inventor here added the` tool' limitations *195 to overcome the rejection in the reissue_examination based on the kain_patent the inventor was conceding that in view of kain he had overclaimed in the073_patent
presumably his excuse was that at the time of the prosecution of the original_application he was unaware of kain
the reissue_procedure is only available to correct error in claims in patents as originally issued
as we have noted before` [ t ] he reissue_statute was not enacted as a panacea for all patent prosecution problems nor as a grant to the patentee of a second opportunity to prosecute de novo his original_application'
in re weiler 790_f.2d_1576 1582 229_uspq_673 677 fed.cir.1986

the reissue_regulations require full explanation of each` excess' in the original_claims
as noted above section 1.175 a 3 the primary applicable subsection concerns` the patentee claiming more.. than he [ or she ] had the right to claim in the patent' and the subsection then expressly requires that the declaration meet the test of` distinctly specifying the excess.. in the claims'
section 1.175 a 5 then requires an explanation of the` errors relied upon and how they arose or occurred'
finally section 1.175 a 6 requires an assertion that each such error arose without deceptive_intent
therefore only if the declaration or any supplemental_declaration establishes that the overclaiming or underclaiming resulted from an excusable error may reissue_application_claims be allowed
if the alterations which the reissue_applicant made were not to correct an` error' they could not be made during reissue.3

by volunteering narrowing amendments to overcome the kain_rejection the patentee was necessarily admitting that he had overclaimed in this respect even while underclaiming in another respect in the original_patent
because the patent_examiner rejected the claims in view of kain he arguably knew in what way the original_patent overclaimed
yet the patentee failed to explain in a supplementary_declaration the source of the overclaiming error or that it was non-deceptive and otherwise excusable
nor did he show how and why the new_limitations corrected the overclaiming
the examiner could not have had any idea of` the errors relied upon' much less` how they arose'
therefore even with respect to the` tool' limitations added merely in response to and to overcome the kain_rejection the purposes of the declaration_requirement have been frustrated
because neither of the declarations filed said one word respecting the` tool' limitations the declarations were wholly insufficient

we therefore hold based on the principle announced in constant and the explicit requirements of 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.175 a 3 5 and 6 that when amendments correcting an overclaiming are made during reissue_prosecution in response to a rejection a patentee is obligated to file a supplementary_declaration explaining the source of the overclaiming error that it was non-deceptive and otherwise excusable and how the amendment corrects the overclaiming
since no declaration either original or supplementary explained the error resulting in the amendments to the reissue_application_claims to include the` tool' limitations the declaration was insufficient
as noted above all the reissue_claims contain the` tool' limitations
therefore they were all properly deemed invalid.4

*196 we do note that this is not a case in which the examiner dictated specific amendments necessary for the reissue_application_claims to be allowed
in that event arguably he would already know what the declaration might tell him
nor is this a case in which only small language changes that do not affect the scope of the claims were suggested by the applicant
we make no comment ruling or intimation on the need for a supplemental_declaration explaining such dictated or non-substantive amendments

ii
nuplas second third and fourth causes of action for trademark_infringement and misrepresentation were dismissed based on the conclusion that nuplas registrations for the trademark_cush-n-grip were invalid as a matter of law because the mark was either 1 generic or 2 merely descriptive and nupla had not proven secondary_meaning
based on overwhelming documentary evidence of record showing widespread and long-time prior use of the cushion-grip mark in the hand tool industry we agree with the district courts conclusion that there is no genuine issue of material fact that nuplas mark which is merely a misspelling of cushion-grip is also generic as a matter of law and the registrations are therefore invalid
see abercrombie & fitch co. v. hunting world inc. 537_f.2d_4 9-10 189_uspq_759 764-65 2d cir.1976 ; mccarthy on trademarks ¡± 12.12 [ 2 ] 3d ed.1992
since the mark is generic there is no need for us to reach the question of possibly acquired secondary_meaning of an otherwise merely descriptive mark

a declaration was also provided by the attorney who prosecuted the reissue_application
this declaration discussed only those issues included in the inventors declaration
2
there is no question that the examiner was authorized to reject the reissue_claims based on the kain prior_art patent
the reissue_regulations state that` [ a ] n original claim if re-presented in the reissue_application is subject to reexamination and the entire application will be examined in the same manner as original_applications..' 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.176
pertinent prior_art is citable even if it was not cited in the original examination
see hewlett-packard co. v. bausch & lomb inc. 882_f.2d_1556 1563 11_uspq2d_1750 1756 fed.cir.1989` reissue is essentially a reprosecution of all claims
for example original_claims which a patentee wants to maintain unchanged may nevertheless be rejected on any statutory ground`
if such re-presented claims can be fully reexamined then it is only logical that an altered_claim can also be fully examined
the need to examine such an altered_claim is more acute since the claim has never been initially examined
thus it was appropriate for the examiner to reject the reissue_application in light of the kain_patent and for the inventor to respond with argument and amendment
there is however nothing in the reissue_statute or regulations that indicates that newly found statutory bases for rejection should be treated differently vis-a-vis the declaration_requirement
3
this is not to say that a reissue_applicant necessarily must admit without basis that an error was made in the original_patent
if for instance this applicant after the rejection in reissue believed that kain did n't affect the patentability of the claims because for instance it concerned not tool_handles but conveyor_idlers he could have simply appealed the final rejection to the board and if necessary to this court
furthermore an applicant need not fear that a reissue_claim may create a new patentability problem
in that instance the applicant could simply amend the reissue_claim during reissue_prosecution and file a supplementary_declaration that once again explains the error in the original_patent and how the new amended reissue_claim solves the problem
the regulations do not require an explanation of any` error' in a withdrawn reissue_claim
4
furthermore the` shaft' limitations are also not addressed by the declaration
nor does nupla present any argument regarding them here
unlike the` tool' limitations which were added during reissue_prosecution the` shaft' limitations were in the initially filed reissue_application
nupla can hardly assert they were necessitated by anything said by the examiner during reissue_examination
even were we to assume that the addition of the` shaft' limitations was to correct some error for instance overbreadth in light of after-discovered prior_art what prior_art this might have been is entirely unexplained
nowhere in the reissue_declaration does the inventor indicate the basis for concluding that the original_claims were overbroad an explanation of how the overclaiming occurred such as that he was unaware of the prior_art nor any explanation of how the error is corrected by adding the` shaft' limitations
therefore more so even than for the` tool' limitations the very purpose of requiring a declaration is entirely frustrated
the reissue examiner could only guess as to the need for purpose of allowability of and sufficiency of the` shaft' limitations
this is exactly the problem the requirement of a reissue_declaration was intended to avoid
thus these unexplained added limitations form an alternative basis for affirming the holding of invalidity of reissue_claims 11-19
