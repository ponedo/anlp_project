background
a
factual background
the technology involved in this case relates to hematology_controls
these controls are used to monitor and test the accuracy and consistency of hematology_analyzers which clinical laboratories use to analyze patient blood samples
specifically hematology_analyzers measure the various components of whole_blood including red blood cells white_blood_cells platelets and reticulocytes,2 and the information gathered is used to diagnose and treat diseases
both streck and r & d manufacture and sell hematology_control_products

prior to 1996 hematology instruments measured reticulocytes and white_blood_cells separately and thus required separate stand-alone hematology_controls-i.e. those that measured only a single component of blood
stand-alone_controls using true_reticulocytes3 and reticulocyte_analogs were well-known in the art before the applications that matured into the patents-in-suit were filed
dr. alan johnson a senior scientist at r & d is a named co-inventor on u.s._patent_no._5736,402` the ¡¬402_patent` which claims stand-alone true_reticulocyte controls
in the mid-1990s dr. wayne ryan the majority owner and chief executive officer of streck invented and patented a method for making reticulocyte_analogs and using those analogs in a stand-alone control
see u.s._patent_no._5432,089` the ¡¬089_patent`
the ¡¬089_patent explains that reticulocyte_analogs` exhibit a reticulocyte_continuum and distribution that is similar to that of normal_human_reticulocytes'
¡¬089_patent_col. 8_ll._36 -39

hematology instrument manufacturers began developing a hematology analyzer that could measure both reticulocytes and white_blood_cells simultaneously in the same blood sample
accordingly there was a need for an integrated_hematology_control containing at least 1 a stabilized reticulocyte_component ; and 2 a fixed and stabilized white_blood_cell_component
*1275 over time both r & d and streck began working on projects aimed at developing an integrated_hematology_control

on august 20 1999 streck filed a patent_application directed to an integrated_reticulocyte_control
that application became the ¡¬500_patent which issued on march_31,_2001
ryan is the named inventor on the ¡¬500_patent
the ¡¬668_patent which issued on april_24,_2001 and the ¡¬388_patent which issued on june_4,_2002 are continuations of the ¡¬500_patent
ryan and john scholl strecks research and development manager are named as coinventors on the ¡¬668 and ¡¬388_patent s. both ryan and scholl assigned their rights in the patents to streck

the parties agree that claim 1 of the ¡¬668_patent is representative for this appeal
it claims` [ a ] hematology_control_composition_comprising a a stabilized reticulocyte_component ; and b a fixed and stabilized white_blood_cell_component capable of exhibiting a five-part_differential'
¡¬668_patent_col. 16_ll._41 -45
the specification explains that the control may suitably contain stabilized reticulocytes that is immature_anucleate_red_blood_cells containing some ribonucleic_acid or an analog thereof
for example among possible_embodiments the reticulocyte_component may comprise true_mammalian_reticulocytes prepared for instance by mammalian e.g
human red_blood_cell_encapsulation or by isolation from whole_blood
the reticulocyte_component is prepared in any suitable_manner
see e.g. [ the ¡¬089_patent ]
alternatively it is possible to obtain suitable_reticulocytes by obtaining blood from an anemic_animal e.g. a pig goat rabbit or the like
¡¬668_patent_col. 3_ll._14 -25
the district_court construed the patents-in-suit to encompass an integrated_reticulocyte_control using either true_reticulocytes or reticulocyte_analogs

on october 18 1999 roughly two months after streck filed its application r & d filed its own patent_application relating to integrated_reticulocyte_controls
dr._johnson is the named inventor of the control_composition in r & ds application
in 2003 after some of strecks patents had issued r & d copied claims from strecks patents into its still-pending application and asked the united_states patent and trademark office` the pto' to declare an interference to determine priority of invention
facts relating to the parties priority dispute are set forth in companion appeal_no.2011-1045 which was previously decided by this court
to the extent necessary those facts are incorporated by reference herein

while r & ds interference_request was pending r & d began manufacturing and selling integrated_hematology_controls the first of which was referred to as cbc-xe
r & d subsequently began producing controls under the names cbc-4k plus retics and cbc-5d plus retics as well
it is undisputed that ryan used his reticulocyte_analog as the reticulocyte_component of the integrated_control when he reduced his invention to practice
in contrast r & ds integrated_controls use true_reticulocytes as the reticulocyte_component

b
procedural history
on june_29,_2006 streck filed suit against r & d in the district of nebraska alleging willful_infringement of the patents-in-suit
r & d counterclaimed seeking a declaration that the asserted_claims of the patents-in-suit are invalid and not infringed

1
identification of the asserted_claims
on december 14 2006 the parties agreed to be bound by the patent local *1276 rules of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california
summary_judgment_order 658 f.supp.2d at 993
patent local rule 3-1 requires that` [ n ] ot later than 10 days after the initial case management conference a party claiming patent_infringement shall serve on all parties adisclosure of asserted_claims and preliminary_infringement_contentions` which sets forth among other_things` [ e ] ach claim of each patent in suit that is allegedly infringed by each opposing party'
n.d. cal
patent_l.r
3-1 a4 likewise rule 3-3 provides that` [ n ] ot later than 45 days after service upon it of thedisclosure of asserted_claims and infringement contentions each party opposing a claim of patent_infringement shall serve on all parties itsinvalidity contentions` identifying each item of prior_art that allegedly anticipates a claim or renders it obvious
patent_l.r
3-3 a
the parties agreed that consistent with rule 3-7 supplementation of invalidity_contentions` was allowed only by order of [ the ] court on a showing of good cause'
summary_judgment_order 658 f.supp.2d at 994

pursuant to the patent_local_rules in a document dated december 15 2006 streck provided its` disclosure of asserted_claims and preliminary_infringement_contentions' which identified the following` claims asserted to be infringed' r & d directly infringes induces others to infringe and/or contributes to third-party infringement of at least_claims 28_and_29 of the ¡¬500_patent claims 1 4 5 6 8-9 13 15 and 26-29 of the ¡¬668_patent and claim 13 of the ¡¬388_patent literally and/or under the doctrine of equivalents through the manufacture use sale offer to sell including r & ds related promotion and advertising and/or importation of r & ds hematology_controls designated` cbc-xe' and` cbc-4k plus retics'
streck inc. v. research & diagnostic sys. inc. no._806cv458 d.neb
apr._16,_2007 ecf_no._32-4 at 2-3
in response on january 19 2007 r & d submitted its` preliminary invalidity contentions' stating that the` johnson inventions anticipate each claim asserted by streck including at least_claims 28_and_29 of the ¡¬500_patent claims 1 4 5 6 8-9 13 15 and 26-29 of the ¡¬668_patent and claim 13 of the ¡¬388_patent'
id
ecf_no._32-5 at 3
on december 16 2008 streck informed r & d that it was asserting only the following ten claims claims 28-29 of the ¡¬500_patent ; claims 1 4 5 6 8 9 and 13 of the ¡¬668_patent ; and claim 13 of the ¡¬388_patent
summary_judgment_order 658 f.supp.2d at 994
subsequently in march 2008 r & d amended its invalidity_contentions to assert that all claims of the patents-in-suit except claim 20 of the ¡¬388_patent were invalid for failure to satisfy enablement and written description_requirements.5

claim construction and final invalidity contentions
on june_5,_2008 the district_court conducted a hearing pursuant to markman v. westview instruments inc. 517_u.s._370 372 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
the court issued its claim construction order on november 12 2008
in that order the court noted that the` claims of the patents make it clear that the reticulocyte *1277 component of the control_composition can be either a reticulocyte or an analog of a reticulocyte'
claim_construction_order 2008_wl_4891132 at *8 2008 u.s._dist
lexis 91865 at *23
the court construed` reticulocyte_analog' to mean` particles made from a source other than naturally occurring reticulocytes such particles appearing to the instrument as reticulocytes that naturally occur in the whole_blood for which the instrument is intended'
id.at *11 2008 u.s._dist
lexis 91865 at *33

on january 2 2009 r & d served its final set of invalidity_contentions alleging that 1 johnsons inventions anticipated each of strecks asserted_claims ; 2 each claim of the patents-in-suit except claim 20 of the ¡¬388_patent was invalid for failure to satisfy enablement and written description_requirements ; and 3 claim 3 of both the ¡¬500 and the ¡¬668_patent_s was invalid for indefiniteness
see summary_judgment_order 658 f.supp.2d at 994

summary judgment motions
on march_27,_2009 the parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment
strecks motion requested judgment that 1 its asserted_claims were valid and contained sufficient written description ; and 2 r & d had infringed the asserted_claims

r & ds motion asserted that 1 claim 3 of the ¡¬500 and ¡¬668_patent_s was invalid as indefinite inoperative or not enabled ; 2 all claims of the patents-in-suit except claim 20 of the ¡¬388_patent were invalid for lack of written description and lack of enablement ; 3 the ¡¬388_patent was invalid for misjoinder6 ; and 4 there was no evidence to support a finding of willful_infringement
specifically with respect to invalidity r & d argued that the patents-in-suit described an integrated_control with reticulocyte_analogs and did not adequately describe an integrated_control with true naturally occurring reticulocytes

on september 9 2009 the district_court denied r & ds motion for summary_judgment on its written description defense and granted strecks cross-motion
first the court held that as a matter of law strecks patents adequately described an integrated_control with true_reticulocytes
summary_judgment_order 658 f.supp.2d at 999
the court noted that r & ds arguments focused primarily on enablement rather than written description and that r & d relied heavily on claim 3 of ¡¬500_patent which was not asserted in strecks initial disclosures
id
the court further found that the level of skill in the art was high and that a person of such skill would understand that the patents were meant to encompass both natural and analog reticulocytes
the court denied r & ds motion for summary_judgment on enablement finding that` there is a genuine_issue of material_fact with respect to the enablement_issue'
id.at 999-1000

next the court dismissed r & ds invalidity counterclaims with respect to claim 3 of the ¡¬500 and ¡¬668_patent_s. the court found that streck did not assert infringement of those claims and that r & d had` noreasonable_apprehension it will face an infringement_suit on any claims other than those that streck asserts it has infringed in this action'
id.at 1000
finally the court found that r & d had as a matter of law literally infringed the claims at issue and that there was evidence from which a jury could find willfulness.7 id

*1278 4
motions in limine
on september 4 2009 both parties filed motions in limine
r & d sought among other_things to exclude evidence relating to strecks conception prior to 1997 on grounds that conception is irrelevant to the question of the priority of invention
streck sought to exclude any evidence challenging the validity of the seventy-four unasserted_claims of the patents-in-suit
streck explained that it had informed r & d that it was only asserting infringement with respect to nine out of the total eighty-three claims of the patents-in-suit and that r & d should be prohibited from presenting evidence or testimony relating to the seventy-four unasserted_claims.8 on october 15 2009 the district_court denied r & ds motion without prejudice to reassertion at trial on grounds that it` involve [ d ] the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence'

lexis 96196 at *9 d.neb
oct._15,_2009
the court also denied strecks motion

although the court finds the subject of the motion is more properly viewed as an objection to be raised at trial the court notes it will generally sustain such an objection..
the validity of claims other than those alleged to have been infringed is not an issue in this case and evidence with respect to those claims is generally not relevant
that said some evidence that touches on the unasserted_claims could be relevant for some purpose
accordingly the court finds that the motion in limine should be overruled at this time without prejudice to its reassertion via timely objection to the admissibility of such evidence at trial
id.at *1-2 2009 u.s._dist
lexis 96196 at *3-4
prior to trial however the district_court excluded r & ds evidence on the unasserted_claims
specifically the court orally ruled that` [ t ] here is an issue about the declaratory_judgment and jurisdiction over the unasserted_claims of the patents
the validity of the unasserted_claims will not go to the jury
thats the way i intend to proceed'
j.a
45134

jury trial and jmol motions
beginning on october 19 2009 the court conducted an eight-day jury_trial to address priority of invention enablement damages and willfulness
at the close of the evidence both parties moved for jmol on the issues of enablement and priority
the court noted that it had permitted the presentation of enablement evidence to the jury so that the court could get a clear understanding of the issue
based on the evidence adduced at trial and before submitting the case to the jury the court granted jmol for streck on enablement explaining that` [ e ] verybody *1279 agrees that if you use encapsulated reticulocytes that you could use dr. ryans invention to describe that'
j.a
46724
the court further explained that` a pig reticulocyte is not a human_reticulocyte so its obviously an analog of a human_reticulocyte'
id
finally the court stated that according to the evidence it would make no difference whether analog or true_reticulocytes were used in ryans claimed invention
with respect to priority the court found that ryan was the first to conceive but that there were substantial factual disputes as to whether johnson was the first to invent
accordingly the only issues submitted to the jury were r & ds priority counterclaim and strecks damages and willful_infringement claims

on october 28 2009 the jury found that 1 r & d had not proven by clear and convincing_evidence that it was the first to invent ; and 2 r & d had not willfully infringed strecks patents
the jury found that streck was entitled to a royalty for r & ds infringing sales and awarded damages of 12.5 % which amounted to $ 92,298.88 plus costs and interest
the court entered judgment in favor of streck on october 29 2009

6
the concurrent interference proceedings and strecks ¡± 146 action
while the infringement litigation was progressing r & ds interference_request was pending with the pto and on march_21,_2007 the pto declared an interference` the pto_interference' between five of strecks patents the patents-in-suit as well as u.s._patent_nos._6403 377_and_6406,915 and r & ds pending patent_application
the sole_count in the pto_interference was count 1 which corresponded to claim 1 of strecks ¡¬668_patent and is identical to the representative_claim in this appeal.9 on august 14 2007 the district_court denied r & ds motion to stay the infringement_suit pending resolution of the pto_interference and the two cases proceeded concurrently

the pto board of patent appeals and interferences` the board' heard the parties arguments regarding priority of invention in february 2009
on november 2 2009 just four days after the district_court entered judgment in this case the board issued its priority_decision
unlike the jury in this case which found priority for streck the board found that r & d had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that johnson was the first to invent the claimed integrated_control

on november 13 2009 streck appealed the boards interference decision to the district_court under 35 u.s.c.¡± 146
the ¡± 146 appeal was assigned to the same judge who presided over the infringement case
because there was a complete evidentiary record on the issue of priority-between the trial and the proceedings before the board-the parties agreed to submit the ¡± 146 action to the district_court on the admitted record without further discovery or offers of proof

7
renewed motion for jmol motion for a new trial and injunctive relief
following the jury_verdict and the boards priority_decision the parties filed three motions on november 12 2009
first r & d filed a renewed motion for jmol and motion for a new_trial
in the motion r & d argued that the court should enter judgment as a matter of law *1280 on its counterclaim for invalidity because there was` insufficient evidence as a matter of law to sustain the jurys verdict that defendants did not meet their burden of proving that dr._johnson was the prior inventor by clear and convincing_evidence'
j.a
45059
second in light of the boards decision in the pto_interference proceedings r & d moved to vacate the judgment in this case stay proceedings and hold a new_trial
finally streck filed a motion for permanent_injunction against r & d to prevent future infringement of the patents-in-suit
the parties agreed to defer judgment on strecks motion for injunctive_relief and r & ds motion for a new_trial until the district_court ruled on the ¡± 146 action so both could be appealed together to this court

the district_court issued three decisions on september 30 2010
first in the co-pending ¡± 146 action the court reversed the boards decision and found priority for streck
as discussed below the ¡± 146 action was at issue in a companion_appeal-appeal_no.2011-1045-which was previously decided by this court
see streck inc. v. research & diagnostic sys. inc. 659_f.3d_1186 fed.cir.2011
second in this case the court denied r & ds renewed motion for jmol and motion for a new_trial
the court found in relevant_part that the evidence at trial supported 1` the jurys finding that r & d did not prove by clear and convincing_evidence that dr._johnson was the first to invent an integrated_reticulocyte_control_composition' ; and 2` the courts finding as a matter of law that strecks patents were adequately enabled'
denial of renewed jmol_order 2010_wl_3926059 at *9-10 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 104461 at *32
finally the court granted strecks motion for a permanent_injunction and assessed additional damages of $ 36,690.18 for infringement occurring since the jury_trial
the court then enjoined r & d from making using or selling the products at issue in this case` as well as any hematology_control_products that are only colorably different_therefrom in the context of the infringed_claims.. and from otherwise infringing the asserted_claims of [ the patents-in-suit ] until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents-in-suit'
j.a
40047

the district_court denied r & ds motion to stay the injunction pending appeal to this court
specifically the court held that r & d 1 did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits regarding enablement priority or lack of written description ; 2 did not show it would be irreparably harmed absent a stay because hematology_controls are only a small part of their business ; and 3 did not show that an injunction would hurt the public interest because there was no showing that streck would be unable to meet the industrys demands for controls
r & d was however granted a sixty-day grace period to clear its inventory because hematology_controls are perishable products

r & d timely appealed the september 30 2010 district_court decisions to this court
this opinion relates solely to the infringement action
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
on appeal r & d does not challenge the district_courts decision that its accused products literally infringe the patents-in-suit as a matter of law
instead r & d argues that the district_court erred when it 1 dismissed r & ds invalidity counterclaims relating to the unasserted_claims ; 2 granted summary_judgment to streck and denied r & ds cross-motion on written description ; 3 granted jmol for streck and denied r & ds cross-motion on enablement ; 4 denied r & ds motion *1281 for renewed jmol and motion for a new_trial on priority ; and 5 issued an overbroad permanent_injunction

for the reasons set forth below we find that 1 the district_court did not err in limiting the action to the claims_streck asserted given r & ds failure to establish a case or controversy with respect to the other_claims ; 2 the patents-in-suit satisfy the written description_requirement as a matter of law because the specification clearly discusses true_reticulocytes as well as analogs ; 3 r & ds evidence failed to create a jury question on the issue of whether the patents-in-suit failed to enable one skilled in the art to make the claimed integrated_controls using true_reticulocytes ; 4 the priority_issue is controlled by this courts ruling in appeal_no.2011-1045 and r & ds related evidentiary challenges are without merit ; and 5 properly construed the language in the permanent_injunction is not overbroad
accordingly we affirm the district_court in full

a
jurisdiction over the unasserted claims
r & d sought summary_judgment of invalidity with respect to all claims of the patents-in-suit
in its summary_judgment_order the district_court noted that 1 streck did not assert infringement with respect to claim 3 of the ¡¬ 500 and ¡¬668_patent_s ; 2 r & d` has noreasonable_apprehension it will face an infringement_suit on any claims other than those that streck asserts it has infringed in this action' ; and 3 there is` nothing in the record to suggest any intent to sue on the nonasserted_claims'
summary_judgment_order 658 f.supp.2d at 1000
although the district_court initially denied strecks motion in limine to exclude argument and evidence regarding the unasserted_claims just before trial the court stated that` [ t ] here is an issue about the declaratory_judgment and jurisdiction over the unasserted_claims of the patents
the validity of the unasserted_claims will not go to the jury'
j.a
45134

r & d argues that the district_court erroneously dismissed its written description and enablement challenges with respect to the unasserted_claims
in support of this argument r & d_submits that the court applied an outdated` reasonable_apprehension of suit_test' and that strecks withdrawal of claims` more than two years into this case' does not deprive the court of jurisdiction over its invalidity counterclaims.10 appellants br
34
r & d also argues that its counterclaim was sufficient to put streck on notice that all claims were at issue

in response streck argues that the district_court correctly dismissed r & ds challenges to its unasserted_claims
specifically streck contends that r & ds counterclaim only sought a declaration of invalidity with respect to the` asserted_claims' and therefore the court had jurisdiction only over claims asserted at the time the relevant motions were filed
for the reasons that follow we conclude that the district_court did not err in finding that it lacked jurisdiction over the unasserted_claims

it is well-established that in patent cases the existence of a` case or controversy must be evaluated on a claim-by-claim_basis'

prior to the supreme_courts decision in medimmune this court applied a two-part test to determine whether there was an actual controversy in a declaratory_judgment_action
under the prior test a declaratory_judgment_plaintiff had to show 1 an explicit action by the patentee that creates the` reasonable_apprehension' of an infringement_suit ; and 2 present activity by the declaratory_judgment_plaintiff that could constitute infringement or steps taken with intent to infringe
gen-probe inc. v. vysis inc. 359_f.3d_1376 1380 fed.cir.2004
in medimmune the supreme_court rejected strict reliance on the` reasonable_apprehension of suit' prong of the test
549 u.s. at 132_n._11 127_s.ct._764 ; see also sandisk corp. v. stmicroelectronics inc. 480_f.3d_1372 1380 fed.cir.2007` the supreme_courts opinion in medimmune represents a rejection of our reasonable_apprehension of suit_test'
the court held that there is no bright-line rule for determining whether an action satisfies the case or controversy requirement and instead what is required is that the dispute be definite and concrete touching the legal relations of parties having adverse_legal_interests ; and that it be real and substantial and admit of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts
medimmune 549 u.s. at 127 127_s.ct._764 citations and quotations omitted
after medimmune courts must look at` all the circumstances' to determine whether a declaratory_judgment_plaintiff has shown a case or controversy between the parties
as this court has explained moreover although the supreme_court rejected the reasonable_apprehension of suit_test as the sole test for jurisdiction` it did not completely do away with the relevance of a reasonable_apprehension of suit'

post-medimmune at least one district_court has found that it lacked declaratory_judgment_jurisdiction over patent_claims that were initially asserted in a broad complaint and subsequently not included in the narrower scope of claims alleged to be infringed
see hoffman-la roche inc. v. mylan inc. no._209-0192 2009_wl_4796736 at *5 2009 u.s._dist

id.at *3 2009 u.s._dist
lexis 114784 at *9
the district_court found that with respect to claims that were no longer asserted the counterclaimant seeking declaratory_judgment` must meet its burden under medimmune and show that a live case or controversy exists and continues to exist on a claim-by-claim_basis and at every stage of the litigation'
id.at *5 2009 u.s._dist

citing scanner_technologies corp. v. icos vision systems corp. 528_f.3d_1365 1382-83 fed.cir.2008 r & d argues that` a patentee can not dictate the scope of a duly filed counterclaim simply by withdrawing some but not all of the asserted patent_claims from the lawsuit'
appellants br
34
as streck argues however r & ds reliance on scanner_technologies is misplaced particularly since the circumstances here are readily distinguishable

in scanner_technologies the patent holder filed suit alleging infringement and the defendant counterclaimed seeking a declaration that both of the patents-in-suit were invalid unenforceable and not infringed
528 f.3d at 1371
the parties stipulated that the case` would rise and fall' on one claim of one of the patents and based on that stipulation the district_court analyzed only that one claim in its infringement_analysis
id
the district_court then found that the claims of both patents-in-suit were invalid as obvious and entered summary_judgment of noninfringement
id.at 1373
the patentee appealed arguing among other_things that the district_court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate and invalidate claims other than the single claim at issue in the infringement_analysis
id.at 1383
although the parties had stipulated that the case would be tried on a representative_claim we found that the district_court nonetheless had jurisdiction over all of the claims because the defendant asserted a counterclaim seeking declaratory_judgment on all claims of the patents-in-suit
id.at 1383-84
specifically we found that the` pleadings represented thatthe case constituted allegations of infringement of both patents and a declaratory_judgment_action seeking invalidity noninfringement and unenforceability of all the claims of the patent in suit'
id.at 1383-84
as such the district_court had jurisdiction to invalidate the claims of both patents-in-suit

unlike the situation in scanner_technologies where the parties stipulated that the court need only analyze one` representative' claim to decide infringement and the patentee never affirmatively disclaimed its allegations of infringement as to the other_claims here as in hoffman the patentee narrowed the scope of its claims at the start of litigation pursuant to the local_patent_rules and did so even further before any dispositive rulings by the court
*1284 streck filed its complaint in june 2006 alleging infringement of` one or more claims' of each of the patents-in-suit
in december 2006 streck served its preliminary_infringement_contentions which narrowed the scope of claims at issue to fifteen specific claims.11 in response r & ds counterclaim was limited to the` asserted_claims' and its initial invalidity_contentions which were served on january 19 2007 addressed the same fifteen claims identified in strecks infringement_contentions
the number of asserted_claims was narrowed again moreover by no later than may 2009 this time to only nine claims
therefore unlike the situation in scanner_technologies where all of the claims were at issue and were never withdrawn or altered by either party here both parties were on notice from the start of litigation that the scope of claims at issue was only a subset of the full patents-in-suit and significantly did not include claim 3 of any patent
and the parties knew precisely which claims were at issue well before the court ruled on the parties summary_judgment motions or conducted trial

r & d relies primarily on its assertion that under medimmune it need not prove reasonable_apprehension of an infringement_suit to vest jurisdiction over its invalidity counterclaims in the district_court
though r & d is correct that the reasonable_apprehension of suit_test is no longer the exclusive test for declaratory_judgment_jurisdiction medimmune does not stand for the proposition that an article iii case or controversy exists automatically whenever a competitor desires to mount a validity challenge
under medimmune a party seeking declaratory_judgment still` has the burden of establishing the existence of an actual case or controversy'
549 u.s. at 140 127_s.ct._764
thus although the district_court relied on pre-medimmune case law in its summary_judgment_order and incorrectly relied on the absence of a` reasonable_apprehension' of suit to defeat jurisdiction considering the totality of the circumstances we agree with the district_courts determination that it lacked jurisdiction over the unasserted_claims
importantly there is no evidence that r & d met its burden of showing a continuing case or controversy with respect to the unasserted_claims
indeed r & d does not seriously argue here that it did so relying instead only on the district_courts misstatement of current governing law.12 because applying medimmune we find that the district_court did not have jurisdiction over the unasserted_claims we affirm its decision not to address them

written description
the district_court found that strecks patents-in-suit satisfied the written description_requirement as a matter of law
summary_judgment_order 658 f.supp.2d at 999
in support of this conclusion the court found that 1 claim 4 of the ¡¬500_patent discloses a composition` wherein the reticulocyte_component comprises reticulocytes prepared by isolation from whole_blood' ; and 2 the ¡¬668 and ¡¬388_patent s` contain additional disclosure of the use of reticulocytes isolated from the blood of anemic_animals'
id

*1285 r & d argues that the district_court erred because` [ t ] he patents-in-suit failed to provide sufficient details for [ a ] person of ordinary_skill in the art to understand that ryan was in possession of a true_reticulocyte integrated_control'
appellants br
35
r & d asks this court to grant its motion for summary_judgment that strecks patents are invalid for lack of written description or in the alternative remand the written description issue for a jury_trial

streck responds by pointing to specific disclosures in the patents-in-suit as evidence that the asserted_claims are adequately described
in light of these disclosures which are discussed below streck argues that the district_court correctly found that the claims and specifications of the patents-in-suit are sufficient to satisfy the written description_requirement as a matter of law
we agree

written description is a statutory requirement set forth in 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
section 112 provides in relevant_part that the specification shall contain a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains or with which it is most nearly connected to make and use the same.. 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 para
1 emphasis added
the written description` must clearly allow persons of ordinary_skill in the art to recognize that [ the inventor ] invented what is claimed'
ariad pharm. inc. v. eli_lilly & co. 598_f.3d_1336 1351 fed.cir.2010 en banc citation and quotations omitted
the test is whether the disclosure` conveys to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date'
id
this test requires an` objective inquiry into the four corners of the specification from the perspective of a person of ordinary_skill in the art'
id
given this perspective in some instances a patentee can rely on information that is` well-known in the art' to satisfy written description
boston sci corp. v. johnson & johnson 647_f.3d_1353 1366 fed.cir.2011
where however the` four corners of the specification directly contradict information that the patentee alleges iswell-known to a person of skill at the effective filing date no reasonable_jury could conclude that the patentee possessed the invention'
id

it is well-established that the` hallmark of written description is disclosure'

id
as we explained in ariad the written description_requirement` does not demand either examples or an actual_reduction to practice ; a constructive_reduction to practice that in a definite_way_identifies the claimed invention can satisfy the written description_requirement'

the pivotal issue here is whether the patents-in-suit provide adequate written *1286 description for integrated_controls using either true_reticulocytes or reticulocyte_analogs
according to r & d the patents-in-suit fail to demonstrate that ryan possessed and invented an integrated_control using true_reticulocytes
in support of this argument r & d asserts that 1` ryan was unable to locate any description of the use of true_reticulocytes in his own patents' when asked to do so during his deposition ; 2 ryan did not consider true_reticulocytes to be part of his invention ; and 3` streck had never attempted to make a true_reticulocyte integrated_control'
appellants br
36

r & d mischaracterizes ryans testimony however
although ryan initially testified that he did not know if he could point to anything specific in the ¡¬500_patent describing the use of true_reticulocytes rather than analogs in an integrated_control he subsequently reviewed the patent and pointed to language providing that` the reticulocyte_component may comprise true_mammalian_reticulocytes prepared for instance by mammalian red_blood_cell_encapsulation or by isolation from whole_blood'
j.a
43601:2-13
based on this language ryan clarified that the patent specifically` covers both kinds' of reticulocytes
id
and the mere fact that ryan chose to reduce his invention to practice using a reticulocyte_analog rather than a true_reticulocyte is not relevant to the written description inquiry
although r & d contends that streck` did not posses true_reticulocyte integrated_controls' streck is not required to prove an actual_reduction to practice as to all disclosures
see ariad 598 f.3d at 1352
instead to satisfy written description streck need only show that the specification itself demonstrates` a constructive_reduction to practice that in a definite_way_identifies the claimed invention'
see id.at 1352
the relevant inquiry therefore is whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would reasonably find that the patent sufficiently described the invention using true_reticulocytes
r & ds expert dr._simson testified that in this case a person of ordinary_skill in the art is` someone with an advanced degree like an m.d
or a ph.d. and with experience in the field'
j.a
46608:10-12

looking to the specifications the patents-in-suit refer to several types of true_reticulocytes [ t ] he control may suitably contain stabilized reticulocytes that is immature_anucleate_red_blood_cells containing some ribonucleic_acid or an analog thereof
for example among possible_embodiments the reticulocyte_component may comprise true_mammalian_reticulocytes prepared for instance by mammalian e.g
human red_blood_cell_encapsulation or by isolation from whole_blood
the reticulocyte_component is prepared in any suitable_manner
see e.g
u.s. pat
no._5432,089 incorporated by reference
alternatively it is possible to obtain suitable_reticulocytes by obtaining blood from an anemic_animal e.g. a pig goat rabbit or the like
¡¬668_patent_col. 3_ll._17 -25 emphases added
likewise the ¡¬500_patent provides that` among possible_embodiments the reticulocyte_component may comprise true_mammalian_reticulocytes prepared for instance by mammalian e.g
human red_blood_cell_encapsulation or by isolation from whole_blood'
¡¬500_patent col. 2_ll._37 -42
these disclosures demonstrate that ryan invented the claimed integrated_control using both true_reticulocytes and reticulocyte_analogs
further as streck points out in its brief this is not a case where a patentee attempts to claim a broad genus without defining specific species
instead as noted streck listed several *1287 specific true_reticulocytes in its specifications

according to r & d ryan testified that true_reticulocytes were not part of his invention
contrary to r & ds suggestion however ryan never said that the claimed integrated_controls could not be made using true_reticulocytes
to the extent ryan testified about the difficulty of using true_reticulocytes in controls the district_court found that his testimony` relate [ d ] to the commercial practicalities of use of true_reticulocytes on a large scale and not to the feasibility or viability of true_reticulocytes in a control'
summary_judgment_order 658 f.supp.2d at 999
we agree with the district_court that ryans testimony when taken in context merely reflected his personal preference for using analogs in integrated_controls

the district_court properly concluded that one skilled in the art would have recognized that the claimed integrated_controls could be made using either true_reticulocytes or reticulocyte_analogs
this is particularly true given the evidence that analogs are designed to mimic true_reticulocytes and that use of true_reticulocytes in stand-alone_controls was well-known in the prior_art
given the language in the patents-in-suit coupled with the well-known use of true_reticulocytes in the prior_art a person of ordinary_skill would understand the patent to include integrated_controls using true_reticulocytes
accordingly we affirm the district_courts decision granting strecks motion for summary_judgment on written description

c. enablement
at the close of the evidence but before the case went to the jury the district_court granted jmol that the patents-in-suit enabled the claimed integrated_hematology_control using both true_reticulocytes and reticulocyte_analogs

although r & d concedes that the patents-in-suit enable the use of reticulocyte_analogs in an integrated_control it argues that they do not enable true_reticulocyte integrated_controls
first r & d argues that the district_court erred by failing to assess whether the patents-in-suit enable the novel_aspect of the claimed invention making and using true_reticulocytes in an integrated_control
according to r & d the court improperly relied on prior_art and knowledge of those skilled in the art to` fill in the missing disclosure as to the novel_aspect of integrating true_reticulocytes into whole_blood controls'
appellants br

in support of this argument r & d points to the testimony of one of strecks experts james janik who testified that the patents-in-suit mention use of true_reticulocytes in an integrated_control but do not` discuss it in any other detail'
j.a
45879:18-22
second r & d_submits that the court erred in granting jmol in favor of streck because the patents-in-suit do not enable a true_reticulocyte integrated_control without` undue_experimentation'
r & d asks this court to grant its motion for jmol or in the alternative *1288 remand the enablement_issue for a jury_trial

in response streck claims that 1 the` novel_aspect' of the patents-in-suit is` an integrated_reticulocyte_control i.e. a single control containing both a reticulocyte_component and a white_blood_cell_component capable of exhibiting a five-part_differential' ; 2 the patents-in-suit enable the use of true_reticulocytes in such integrated_controls because true_reticulocytes are` virtually indistinguishable' from analogs ; 3 r & d failed in its burden to prove invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence ; and 4 r & ds expert testimony was conclusory and legally insufficient to preclude jmol

auto

the district_court granted the motion on grounds that the specification failed to provide adequate detail to teach a person of skill in the art to make an electronic_sensor without undue_experimentation

on appeal this court found that the electronic_sensors were novel for side-impact crash sensing and agreed with the district_court that the patentee had not disclosed sufficient detail to make a side-impact electronic_sensor
id.at 1283-84
in reaching this conclusion we reviewed the specification and noted that although it detailed mechanical side-impact_sensors there was only one short paragraph and one figure showing an electronic_sensor
id.at 1282
we explained that` [ e ] lectronic side impact_sensors are not just another known species of a genus consisting of sensors but are a distinctly different sensor compared with the well-enabled mechanical side impact sensor that is fully discussed in the specification'
id.at 1285
we disagreed with the patentees argument that the knowledge of one skilled in the art could supply the missing information regarding how the electronic_sensor operates and reiterated that the specification not the knowledge of those skilled in the art` must supply the novel_aspects of an invention' to satisfy the enablement_requirement
id.at 1283 citing genentech inc. v. novo nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1366 fed.cir.1997

although r & d argues that` streck presented no evidence that the preparation and stabilization methods used for true_reticulocyte stand-alone_controls would work with integrated_reticulocyte_controls' the burden was on r & d to show invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
see appellants br
47
the question here is whether there was a legitimate issue of fact regarding enablement-i.e. regarding whether the specification contains sufficient information to enable a person skilled in the art to make integrated_hematology_controls using either true_reticulocytes or reticulocyte_analogs
after full review of the record we agree with the district_court that considering its burden at trial r & d failed to submit sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that one skilled in the art could not have followed strecks specification to substitute true_reticulocytes for ryans reticulocyte_analog in the claimed control

unlike the situation in automotive_technologies where the electronic_sensors differed in structure and operation from mechanical sensors here there was unrebutted evidence that true_reticulocytes and ryans reticulocyte_analogs` work in exactly the same_way in a hematology_control and are virtually indistinguishable even to one skilled in the art'
appellees br
39
indeed the patents-in-suit incorporate by reference ryans prior patent for a stand-alone control using reticulocyte_analogs u.s._patent_no._5432,089` the ¡¬089_patent`
see ¡¬668_patent_col. 3_ll._16 -23
the ¡¬ 089 patent describes how reticulocyte_analogs are made and explains that the` synthetic reticulocytes which are used in the reference control of the invention exhibit a reticulocyte_continuum and distribution that is similar to that of normal_human_reticulocytes'
¡¬089_patent_col. 8_ll._35 -43
as such the specification and the ¡¬089_patent incorporated by reference therein support strecks position *1290 that true_reticulocytes and reticulocyte_analogs work in the same_way in a hematology_control

at trial moreover ryan testified that` i would dare say hardly anyone i know could tell the difference between [ analog ] and standard reticulocytes'
j.a
45587:6-7
similarly another streck expert mr. scholl testified that` under a microscope [ analogs ] are very similar to human_reticulocytes'
j.a
45518:21-24
in other_words the enabling disclosure in strecks patents for use of reticulocyte_analogs is equally enabling with respect to true_reticulocytes and importantly r & d failed to offer evidence to the contrary

r & d also failed to produce adequate evidence that the experimentation required to create a true_reticulocyte integrated_control would be unduly laborious for one of ordinary_skill in the art
r & d relies primarily on its own expert dr._simson who testified that` the patents do not enable a person of ordinary_skill in the art to make.. an integrated_control preparation containing naturally occurring reticulocytes'
j.a
46613:9-12
simson further testified that` there is no real description in the patent itself enabling one to do it' and there were no examples` of how to make this material using natural occurring reticulocytes' in the patents
j.a
46610:25-46611:5
as streck argues however conclusory expert assertions do not give rise to a genuine_issue of material_fact
although simson testified that` a large amount of experimentation' would be necessary on cross-examination he admitted after he was presented with his own conflicting deposition testimony that he has never been involved in developing controls
see j.a
46611:19-24 ; 46621:13-46622:20

although r & d argues that ryan and scholl admitted that the quantity of experimentation to make and use a true_reticulocyte integrated_control would be high r & d mischaracterizes this testimony
indeed when taken in context most of the testimony r & d cites was referring to the difficulty that would have been experienced in attempting to combine a reticulocyte into an integrated_control prior to ryans disclosure
for example when asked about developing a control ryan responded that` sometimes its pretty hard..
i think that usually when we have to make a control three or four of us will work on it and it may take us anyway [ sic ] from one to two years
so it does n't happen instantaneously'
j.a
45596:5-9
ryan clarified that statement however when he noted that development and testing for a true_reticulocyte integrated_control would be` a lot less for the obvious reason that i have already gone through the process once
going through with a different analog with an animal analog should n't be that much harder'
j.a
45714:14-17
ryan further testified that a person skilled in the art knew that true_reticulocytes could be used in controls and that he had in fact previously developed stand-alone_controls using animal cells

during cross-examination when asked whether anyone at streck ever tried to make an integrated_control using a true_reticulocyte scholl testified that although he was not aware of any instances` we knew that we could if we wanted to'
j.a
45539:12
scholl then testified that` some testing' would be required to use a true_reticulocyte in an integrated_control but that` the same technology would be involved with either one of the two types of reticulocytes'
see j.a
45539:16-45540:17
likewise when asked whether it would be difficult to use a true human_reticulocyte cell in the integrated_control janik testified that` [ e ] ven if [ ryans patent ] gave you the exact formula you would have to test it' but` it does n't seem like *1291 its a huge amount of effort'
j.a
45844:6-14
and when asked whether a person skilled in the art would have to conduct` extraordinary experimentation' rather than` just routine testing' janik testified that the reticulocyte_analog that was made even looked like a real reticulocyte under the microscope.. you ca n't predict everything but you know if the question was would you predict that using animal retics would work pretty much as well ?
the answer would be yes because they both look the same and probably act the same to some degree but would still have to be tested with the different instruments and understand that
j.a
45844:21-45845:7
finally strecks expert dr. langley testified as follows q
with regard to the state of the art as you understood it as one of ordinary_skill in the art in 1999 there were a number of complications that you would need to overcome in order to take a reticulocyte-only control and use it in an integrated_control ; is n't that correct ?
a. i remember giving that opinion when i was asked to analyze the other patent
yes
* * * q. dr. langley is it correct that i asked you in fact on the next page of paragraph 39 you lay out a number of complications that would need to be overcome in order to take a reticulocyte-only control and use it in an integrated_control is n't that right ?
and you said yes correct ?
a
thats what it says
q
and then i asked you to overcome those you would have to do a substantial amount of testing correct ?
a
that's- q
you said` i think so yeah'
a
thats what it says
q
thats what i thought
j.a
46013:9-46014:17
according to r & d this testimony is evidence of langley admitting that` there would be a number of complications to overcome in order to use a true_reticulocyte stand-alone control in an integrated_reticulocyte_control'
appellants br
54
streck accurately responds however that langley was` discussing the difficulties in combining any reticulocyte_component true or analog into an integrated_control before ryan disclosed his invention'
appellees br
45
langley did not say that making an integrated_control using true_reticulocytes would be more difficult than making it with analogs
nor did he testify that after reading the patents-in-suit a person of ordinary_skill would have to conduct the same level of experimentation ryan already completed to make the claimed invention using reticulocyte_analogs

the foregoing testimony when taken in context establishes that no undue_experimentation would be necessary once the teachings in the patents-in-suit were known
in light of this testimony the district_court correctly concluded that there was no evidence showing that it would make any difference whether true_reticulocytes or reticulocyte_analogs were used in the claimed integrated_control
importantly there was no testimony from which a jury could find that using true_reticulocytes would require` undue_experimentation
`` 13 because r & d failed to *1292 offer any evidence showing that one skilled in the art could not follow the patents teachings to use a true_reticulocyte in the claimed integrated_control a reasonable_jury could not have found the patents invalid for lack of enablement by clear and convincing_evidence.14 as such the district_court did not err in granting strecks jmol with respect to enablement

d. priority and evidentiary rulings
the jury found in favor of streck on the issue of priority
r & d filed a renewed motion for jmol which the court denied on grounds that the evidence adduced at trial` supports the jurys finding that r & d did not prove by clear and convincing_evidence that dr._johnson was the first to invent an integrated_reticulocyte_control_composition'
denial of renewed jmol_order 2010_wl_3926059 at *9-10 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 104461 at *32

in appeal_no.2011-1045 we affirmed the district_courts award of priority to streck in the ¡± 146 action
streck 659 f.3d at 1196
it is undisputed that resolution of priority in that appeal controls the priority_issues here where r & ds burden was higher and this courts deference to the jury_verdict is substantial
specifically in the ¡± 146 action r & d had to establish priority by a preponderance of the evidence whereas in this appeal r & d had to show its priority_defense by clear and convincing_evidence
as such our decision in appeal 2011-1045 that r & d failed to establish priority by a preponderance of the evidence necessarily means that r & d could not meet the clear and convincing burden required in this case
and because the priority_defense here was decided by a jury on appeal r & d has to show that the jurys findings were not supported by substantial_evidence
in addition as streck argues because the ¡± 146 appeal involved the same parties the same evidence and the same priority_issue presented in this appeal r & d is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from challenging this courts priority_determination in appeal_no.2011-1045

in the alternative r & d argues that this court should overturn the jury_verdict and remand for a new_trial on priority because the district_court` abused its discretion and materially prejudiced r & ds priority case by committing several errors relating to the presentation of evidence'
appellants br
63-64
in particular r & d argues that the court erred when it 1 denied r & ds motion in limine regarding conception and diligence ; 2 failed to control the order of proof by allowing streck` to preemptively rebut r & ds case-in-chief on invalidity' ; and 3 submitted a misleading question to the jury on the verdict form
each of these arguments relates to priority which as previously discussed is controlled by this courts prior decision in the companion_appeal
resolution of that appeal renders *1293 r & ds arguments regarding priority moot

to the extent r & ds evidentiary challenges can be construed to relate to anything other than priority we have considered them and find that they are without merit particularly given the level of deference afforded to district_courts with respect to motions in limine and the order of proof and presentation of evidence

e. injunction
after the jury_trial streck moved for a permanent_injunction
the district_court applied the four-factor test for injunctive_relief set forth in ebay inc. v. mercexchange llc 547_u.s._388 391 126_s.ct._1837 164_l.ed.2d_641_(2006) and concluded that all four factors favored entry of an injunction
specifically the court ordered that r & d is prohibited from making using offering to sell selling or importing into the united_states or supplying from the united_states or causing to be made used offered for sale sold imported into the united_states or supplied from the united_states the infringing hematology_control_products presently designated cbc-xe cbc-4k plus retics and cbc-5d plus retics as well as any hematology_control_products that are only colorably different_therefrom in the context of the infringed_claims whether individually or in combination with other products or as a part of another product and from otherwise infringing the asserted_claims of [ the patents-in-suit ] until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents-in-suit
j.a

we review the district_courts decision entering an injunction as well as the scope of the injunction for abuse of discretion
i4i ltd. p'ship v. microsoft corp. 598_f.3d_831 861 fed.cir.2010 citation omitted

r & d argues that the district_court erroneously entered the injunction and that the injunction itself is overbroad because it prohibits r & d` from otherwise infringing the asserted_claims of [ the patents-in-suit ] until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents-in-suit'
appellants br
69
specifically r & d asks this court to vacate the injunction or replace it with one limited to` the adjudicated cbc-xe cbc-4k plus retics and cbc-5d plus retics products and products not more than colorably different_therefrom'
id.at 70
streck responds that` the injunction already prohibits exactly what r & d proposes by expressly listing the three adjudicated products and extending only to products that areonly colorably different_therefrom
`` appellees br
64
we agree with streck

r & d does not challenge any of the courts underlying ebay findings
as such r & ds sole argument on appeal relates to overbreadth
after careful consideration we find that r & ds argument is without merit particularly given the language in the injunction referring to the specific products at issue in this case
mere inclusion of the phrase` from otherwise infringing the asserted_claims' when taken in the context of the entire order and record on which it was entered does not render the injunction overbroad
see signtech usa ltd. v. vutek inc. 174_f.3d_1352 1359 fed.cir.1999 holding that in light of the` detailed record' on which it was entered an injunction prohibiting` any further infringement.. of the patent' complied with the specificity requirements set forth in fed.r.civ.p
65 d
simply put we read the injunction to contain the very limitations r & d now seeks

*1294 conclusion
for the foregoing reasons and because we find that r & ds remaining arguments are without merit we affirm the district_courts judgment against r & d and its decision entering a permanent_injunction in favor of streck

affirmed

as noted below r & ds discussion of timing with respect to the unasserted_claims ignores the fact that streck served its preliminary_infringement_contentions which narrowed significantly the scope of the asserted_claims only months after the action was filed
11
r & ds assertion that streck did not narrow its asserted_claims until 2008 is wrong
although neither party cites to the preliminary infringement and invalidity_contentions a careful examination of the docket clarifies that the timing described here is in fact the correct one
12
the fact that r & d amended its invalidity_contentions in march 2008 and january 2009 does not alone create a case or controversy
13
in its order denying r & ds renewed motion for jmol and motion for a new_trial the district_court specifically found that` streck presented undisputed evidence that its invention was properly enabled' and that r & d failed to show that a person skilled in the art would have to undergo` undue_experimentation'` to create a control_composition with other reticulocyte_analogs than those described in the patent'

while we believe the evidence clearly supports a finding of enablement the standard of review imposed upon us by the district_courts decision to take this fact laden inquiry away from the jury is an exacting one
despite careful application of that standard of review we ultimately conclude that the district_courts jmol ruling should be affirmed
see fed.r.civ.p
50 b advisory committees note on the 1991 amendments` [ t ] he court may often wisely decline to rule on a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of evidence and it is not inappropriate for the moving party to suggest such a postponement of the ruling until after the verdict has been rendered`
