*1338 background
a
the patents-in-suit
the ¡¬514_patent is a continuation of ¡¬302_patent which is a continuation of the ¡¬794_patent
all three patents share the same written description.1 the patents explain that medical_implements such as catheters and luer ports are common sites for transmissions of pathogens into patients
¡¬794_patent_col. 1_ll._32 -35
to prevent these types of transmissions medical staff traditionally swabbed a site before making connections to medical_implements
id
col. 1_ll._41 -45
the swabs came in a small pad of cotton gauze soaked in a cleaning_agent e.g. isopropyl alcohol and packed in a foil_package to prevent evaporation
id
col. 1_ll._45 -47
after swabbing the site is allowed to dry killing any pathogens
id
col. 1_ll._48 -55

in practice these swabbing procedures were often` overlooked' or` poorly executed'
id
col. 1_ll._56 -58
to overcome this problem the inventors provided a cleaning device that includes a cap that when used reliably disinfects a medical_implement
for example fig._6 provided below shows a cross-sectional diagram of a cleaning device 100 that includes a cap 102
id
col. 6_ll._19 -20
cap 102 includes threads 105 adapted to receive a medical_implement and first and second cleaning_materials 107_and_108
id
col. 6_ll._26 -big_token__30_and_49__big_token -52
when the medical_implement is twisted into cap 102 first cleaning_material 107 compresses radially cleansing the sides of the implement and second cleaning_material 108 compresses axially cleansing the foremost surface of the implement
see id
col. 7_ll._27 -33

?
central to the parties arguments on summary_judgment are openings that permit venting of the interior of the cap
the patents describe two embodiments of these openings
first in fig._6 threaded ring 106 can create` a small_vent_aperture or opening' relative to the inner wall of cap 102 to allow evaporation of the cleaning_agent in cap 102
id
col. 6_ll._37 -43
second in fig._14 provided below holes 164 are formed in housing 162 of the cap
holes 164` can promote evaporation of the cleaning_agent particularly when the housing covers a site of a medical_implement to be disinfected'
id
col. 8_ll._15 -17

?
*1339 the asserted_claims of the patents-in-suit recite cleaning devices that include a` second_opening'` aperture' or` means for venting' that inhibit pressure buildup and allow for evaporation.2 for example claim 13 of the ¡¬794_patent recites

13
a cleaning device for a medical_implement the cleaning device comprising a cap having a first_opening to an inner_cavity an inner surface of the first_opening including one or more threads adapted to receive a site of the medical_implement ; a cleaning_material formed of a compressible material that is at least partially secured in the inner_cavity the cleaning_material containing a cleaning_agent ; a second_opening in the cap to allow evaporation of the cleaning_agent from the inner_cavity and to inhibit a buildup of pressure in the cap when the cleaning_material is compressed by the site of the medical_implement and a removable covering that covers the first_opening and the second_opening to the inner_cavity prior to coupling the threads of the cap with the site of the medical_implement via the first_opening

c. prosecution history
in february 2007 bobby rogers and paul diperna filed non-provisional application no._11 /705,805 the` ¡¬805 application' which led to the ¡¬794_patent
in response to a september 2009 office action which rejected all of the claims as either anticipated by hoang or obvious over hoang *1342 and various secondary references the applicant amended the claims to recite inter alia vents that allow for evaporation or drying of the cleaning_agent
j.a
5412-18
in response the examiner allowed the application
j.a
5029-33
in the notice of allowance the examiner stated that` the reviewed prior_art does not disclose or render obvious a medical_implement cleaning device comprising a cap having holes or openings for venting the device while in use' j.a
5033 and that hoang does not disclose` vent holes apertures or additional openings to inhibit vacuum [ sic ] in the cap cleaning device'
j.a
5034
the ¡¬794_patent issued thereafter in august 2010

the ¡¬794 and ¡¬302_patent s were each subject to ex parte reexamination
in each of these proceedings the examiner initially rejected the claims over various references
in at least the reexamination of the ¡¬794_patent the examiner considered the hoang_reference
j.a
5097-98
the examiner determined that the challenged claims of the ¡¬794 and ¡¬302_patent s were patentable over the cited prior_art based at least partially on the vent_limitations
j.a
38 ; j.a
54 ; j.a
5097-98 ; j.a
5161-62

hospira later requested inter partes reexamination of the patents-in-suit which the united states patent and trademark office granted
after the examiner rejected claims in an action closing prosecution` acp' ivera attempted to enter seven declarations including one from an inventor of the hoang_reference minh_hoang and another from dr._alan_buchman the sole_inventor of a prior_art reference relied on during the inter_partes_reexaminations but not at issue here
j.a
5473
in the right of appeal notice` ran' the examiner determined that these declarations would not be considered because ivera had not explained why this evidence was not presented earlier in the proceedings
j.a
5473

assessing the merits the examiner rejected all of the challenged claims as obvious over the combination of hoang and chin-loy among other rejections
j.a
5467-68 5513-14 5553-54
the examiner concluded that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill to include` the venting channel of chin-loy in the cap housing of hoang because it would allow for venting from the cap interior while preventing the infiltration of microorganisms to maintain the sterile condition of the catheter access site'
j.a
5468
the examiner also concluded that because threaded luer connections are not fluid-tight a threaded opening such as the ones disclosed in hoang and white can meet the vent_limitations

ivera informs us that it is appealing the rejections to the patent trial and appeal board

d. procedural posture
ivera sued hospira for infringement of the ¡¬794 and ¡¬302_patent s in 2011 and for infringement of the ¡¬514_patent in 2012
in october 2013 the district_court issued its claim constructions for the disputed terms of all of the patents-in-suit
relevant here the district_court construed the term` opening' or` first_opening' to mean` an entrance or exit to the inner_cavity of the cap'` second_opening' to mean` a second distinct channel or pathway that extends from the interior to the exterior of the cap' and` aperture' to mean` a channel pathway hole gap or split'
j.a
5433 5435 5437
the district_court also construed` means for venting' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6,4 to mean` the following *1343 combination of proposed terms a a threaded ring that fits into a groove that is formed in the inside edge surface of the cap near the opening where the threaded ring includes or creates with the cap wall a small_vent_aperture or opening ; b holes in the housing of the cap ; and c permitted equivalents of a and b'
j.a
5439
the parties do not challenge these constructions before us

in april 2014 the district_court granted hospiras motion for summary_judgment of invalidity
j.a
9
the district_court found that the scope of the prior_art included hoang chin-loy and white
j.a
13
the court further found that the level of ordinary_skill is a person with` a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering biomedical engineering or a comparable field with anywhere from two to five years work in the disposable medical_device industry'
j.a
16

considering the differences between the prior_art and the claimed inventions the court found that the` patents-in-suit contain the same elements that perform the same functions they had been known to perform in the prior_art' j.a
16 and that the` arrangement of elements in the asserted_claims do [ es ] not yield anything other than predictable results' j.a
18
the court noted however that hoang does not disclose the vent_limitations
j.a
19
still a person of ordinary_skill would not` need the benefit of hindsight to realize that adding a vent would relieve possible pressure on the inside of the cap'
j.a
19
according to the court a person of ordinary_skill would recognize the benefits of adding a vent as allegedly taught in chin-loy i.e. it would allow venting of the interior of the medical_device through a blood_port during sterilization
j.a
19 citing chin-loy_col. 5_ll._1 -20
a person of ordinary_skill would also recognize that adding a second_opening would allow the cleaning_agent to` vent onto the exterior of the medical_implement sterilizing a larger portion of it' as allegedly described in white
j.a
19 citing white_col. 7_ll._23 -35
thus the district_court determined that` the record demonstrates no triable issue of material_fact on obviousness for the asserted_claims of the patents-in-suit'
j.a
20
the district_court further found that iveras evidence of secondary indicia of nonobviousness did not rebut this conclusion stating that` [ t ] he asserted_claims encompassed obvious subject_matter regardless of evidence of secondary factors and as a result fail to meet the requirement of ¡± 103'
j.a

discussion
summary judgment is appropriate if` the movant shows that there is no genuine_dispute as to any material_fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 a
we review a grant or denial of summary_judgment under the law of the regional circuit which in this case is the ninth_circuit
aristocrat techs
austl pty ltd. v. int l game tech. 709_f.3d_1348 1361 fed.cir.2013
the ninth_circuit reviews such a decision de novo
humane soc y of the u.s. v. locke 626_f.3d_1040 1047 9th cir.2010
that is we apply the same standard applied by the district_court
lew v. kona hosp. 754_f.2d_1420 1423 9th cir.1985
in doing so we resolve factual disputes against the movant
gen._elec co. v. joiner 522_u.s._136 143 118_s.ct._512 139_l.ed.2d_508_(1997)
we must also take into account that invalidity of a patent must be shown by clear and convincing_evidence
microsoft corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship -- - u.s. -- -- 131_s.ct._2238 2243 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011) ; see also *1344 anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)

under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a patent may not be obtained` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains
`` 5 obviousness is a legal question based on the following underlying factual inquiries 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 secondary evidence of nonobviousness
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
`` a party seeking to invalidate a patent on obviousness grounds must demonstrate by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so'
intouch techs. inc. v. vgo commc'ns inc. 751_f.3d_1327 1347 fed.cir.2014 internal citations and quotation marks omitted
determining whether one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the teachings of different references is a flexible inquiry and the motivation is not required to be found in any particular prior_art reference
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 415 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)

ivera argues that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to add a vent to hoangs cap
appellants br
33
instead the record shows according to ivera that the conventional wisdom among those skilled in the art was that disinfecting caps should be fluid tight
id
hospira responds that chin-loy describes benefits of venting a cap which would have motivated a person of ordinary_skill to add a similar vent to hoangs cap
appellees br
29
hospira also cites the written description of the patents-in-suit as encouraging evaporation of cleaning_agents
id
a person of ordinary_skill in the art would also have according to hospira seen the benefit of bathing the exterior of a cap as allegedly described in white
id.at 31

we agree with ivera that record evidence establishes a genuine_dispute over whether a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to add a vent to hoangs disinfecting cap
during the inter_partes_reexaminations ivera submitted multiple expert declarations
as noted above the examiner decided not to consider these declarations because ivera did not establish why it had not submitted them earlier
hospira does not however challenge iveras reference to these declarations at the summary_judgment_stage before the district_court
the declarations indicate that a person of ordinary_skill would have desired fluid-tight disinfecting caps to retain the cleaning_agent included within the cap
for example ivera relies on a declaration from an inventor of the hoang_reference minh_hoang
in his declaration minh_hoang states that` [ a ] t the time of my invention it was the understanding and belief of persons of ordinary_skill in the art such as myself that such a cap should seal over the access_portion of the access_valve and retain the cleaning_solution contained in the cap'
j.a
5652
referring to the cap described in the hoang_reference minh_hoang explains the cap` avoided using any pathways or channels out of the housing of the cap during placement or use on the access_valve because *1345 doing so would allow an exit of the cleaning_solution from the cap which i believed would reduce the effectiveness of the cap'
j.a
5653
although the statements of an inventor are not controlling as to the content of a patent application hospira does not challenge minh_hoangs assertion that he is a person of ordinary_skill
iveras expert karl_leinsing agreed with minh_hoang that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not seek to add a vent to hoangs cap because doing so would cause the loss of cleaning_solution
j.a
5618
karl_leinsing added that in his opinion fluid-line connections are generally presumed to be` fluid-tight to avoid leakage of any such fluid into the hospital environment'
j.a
5585

ivera also submitted a declaration from dr._alan_buchman the sole_inventor of a prior_art patent cited in the inter_partes_reexaminations
in his declaration dr._buchman states that his goal in creating a catheter cleaning device was to` create a device that would form a fluid-tight_seal over the injection_port and continuously bathe the surface of the injection_port entrance in the antimicrobial solution to obtain the best possible disinfection' and that` [ e ] stablishing and maintaining a fluid-tight_seal over the injection_port was an important aspect of my design'
j.a
5293
it was` commonly understood' according to dr._buchman that effective disinfection of the surface of the injection_port` required that it be continuously bathed in the antimicrobial fluid'
j.a
5293-94

hospira argues that the prior_art provides reasons to add a vent to hoangs cap
appellees br
29
for example chin-loy describes a channel that permits venting of the medical_device during sterilization
chin-loy_col. 5_ll._1 3-15
chin-loy however relates to blood_ports of hemodialysis_machines
id
col. 3_ll._19 -23
hospira cites no evidence explaining how this description is relevant to disinfecting caps
hospira has not explained for example whether disinfecting caps like the one described in hoang are sterilized or would benefit from venting during such a sterilization procedure
chin-loy thus does not foreclose a genuine_dispute over whether a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to add a vent to hoangs cap

hospira also cites the following passage of the ¡¬794_patents written description as indicating that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not seek to retain the cleaning_solution but rather seek to have the cleaning_solution evaporate the site should be allowed to dry usually twenty to thirty seconds immediately prior to making any connection
thisdrying period is important when alcohol dries it breaks open the cellular walls of microorganisms thereby killing them
¡¬794_patent_col. 1_ll._51 -55
this passage however relates to manual swabbing of a site and hospira presents no evidence relating these teachings to the use of disinfecting caps
in fact earlier in the same paragraph the patents explain that caps are designed to retain the cleaning_agent explaining that the swabs are packed individually in a foil_package to` retain the alcohol within the package and to prevent evaporation'
id
col. 1_ll._45 -47
in any event the tradeoff between the desire to retain the cleaning_agent and the patents disclosure regarding drying is a factual matter left to the factfinder

finally hospira points to whites disclosure of bathing` the exterior_surfaces of distal_member 70 proximal_member 82 and self-sealing septum 84'
white_col. 7_ll._29_-35
the parties dispute whether this disclosure means that the antiseptic bathes only threaded shoulder 74 of distal_member 70 as ivera asserts or if the antiseptic drips down the outside of distal_member *1346 70 as hospira asserts
appellants br
28 ; appellees br
31
white is not clear on which interpretation is correct and neither side points to any other evidence favoring one interpretation
this dispute over the content of white is a factual dispute that we must resolve in iveras favor at the summary_judgment_stage
plantronics inc. v. aliph inc. 724_f.3d_1343 1356-57 fed.cir.2013 ; gen._elec co. 522 u.s. at 143 118_s.ct._512
the cited passage from white does not therefore indicate that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have sought to add a vent to hoangs cap

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we hold that ivera established a genuine_dispute over whether one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to add a vent to the disinfecting cap described in hoang
accordingly we reverse the district_courts entry of summary_judgment of invalidity
