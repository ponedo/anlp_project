opinion
reyna circuit_judge
this case is about disavowal of claim_scope
the specification and prosecution_history of poly-america l.p.s` poly-america' u.s. patent no._8702,308`308_patent` contain clear and unequivocal statements that the inventor intended to limit the claimed invention to a trash_bag with` short_seals' at its upper_corners that extend inwardly to narrow the bags upper_opening
in light of the inventors disavowal the district_court correctly construed the term` short_seal' to require that such seals extend inwardly
we therefore affirm

*1133 i
background
a. patented technology
the308_patent is` directed toward an improved construction of an elastic drawstring trash_bag'
'308_patent col. 3_ll._46 -47

?
id
fig._1
the claimed apparatus is made from two` panels' of polymeric material joined at the sides and the bottom to form an enclosed bag
at the bottom the panels are joined by a` bottom fold'
at the top a piece of each panel is folded over and sealed to form a` hem'
inside each hem is a drawstring
see id
col. 3_ll._46 -54

the patent identifies two different seals located along the sides of the bag
the long seals along the length of the panels are referred to as` side_seals'
id
col. 4_ll._66 -67
the small seals in the upper_corners of the bag are referred to as` short_seals'
id
col. 5_ll._25 -30
the short_seals bind together each panels hem and the ends of the drawstrings located therein
id

a principal feature of the claimed invention is poly-americas use of inwardly extended_short_seals to reduce the width of the trash_bags upper_opening
when coupled with elastic_drawstrings the narrowed opening allows those drawstrings to wrap around the rim of a trash_receptacle more securely than prior_art_trash_bags that do not have a narrowed upper_opening
see id
col. 6_l._32 -col. 7_l._19

throughout its written description the308_patent indicates the significance of the extended_short_seal_feature and the reduced upper_opening_width the extended_short_seals provide
to start the title of the invention is` reduced opening elastic drawstring bag'
the abstract explains that *1134 [ w ] hen the bag of the present_invention is in a relaxed_state the reduced upper_opening_width of the elastic_drawstring_bag is therefore less than bag_proper_width allowing a consumer to pull the elastic_drawstring_bag over the lip of a trash_receptacle and allowing the elastic_drawstrings to snugly fit around the trashcan
the background of the invention section explains that prior_art_trash_bags do not have extended_short_seals and can be difficult to secure over the lip of a trash_receptacle
id
col. 2_ll._15 -54
the summary of the invention states that` embodiments of the elastic_drawstring_bag contemplated by the present_invention have an upper_opening with a width that is less than 97 % of the width of the rest of the bag by virtue of the extended_short_seals'
id
col. 4_ll._4 -7
of the five figures in the308_patent the only figure that does not reveal a reduced upper_opening by virtue of extended_short_seals is the figure that depicts prior art drawstring bags
id
figs
1-5

the written description reiterates that the use of extended_short_seals to reduce the width of the bags upper_opening is an improvement upon prior_art_trash_bags
id
col. 5_ll._46 -57
it also identifies the use of extended_short_seals to create a reduced width upper_opening as` one of the characteristics of the present_invention' in looking at both fig._1 and fig._2 it is important to note that one of the characteristics of the present_invention is a reduction in the upper_width when the bag is in a relaxed_state of the bag resulting from the extended_short_seals
id
col. 6_ll._11 -15

b
independent and dependent claims
the308_patent has three independent_claims 1 10 and 16
claim 10 differs from claims 1_and_16 in that it does not explicitly provide for a narrowed opening
claim 1 includes a limitation of` the relaxed upper_opening_width being less than the bag_proper_width'
id
col. 7_ll._27 -52
claim 16 describes` the distance between an interior_edge of the first_short_seal and an interior_edge of the second_seal being less than a bag_proper_width'
id
col. 8_l._65 -col. 9_l._18
in contrast claim 10 does not expressly state any limitation as to the size of the short_seals or the relationship between the size of the upper_opening and the bag proper 10
an elastic drawstring trash_bag comprising a polymeric bag comprised of a first_panel and a second_panel the first_panel and the second_panel joined at a first side a second side and a bottom a first_hem formed in the first_panel the first_hem having a first_elastic_drawstring disposed therein a second hem formed in the second_panel the second hem having a second_elastic_drawstring disposed therein the first_panel the first_elastic_drawstring the second_panel and the second_elastic_drawstring inseparably joined together at a first_short_seal and at a second short_seal and
a first access cutout along the upper_edge of the first_panel and a second access cutout along the upper_edge of the second_panel the first and second_elastic_drawstrings being accessible through the respective first and second access cutouts
id
col. 8_ll._23 -38

claims 12-14 which are dependent on claim 10 provide specific limitations as to how much the upper_opening must be narrowed
claim 12 provides for` the ratio of a distance between the first_seal and the second_seal to a width of the bag_proper_being less than 97 %'
id
col. 8_ll._45 -48
*big_token__1135_claim_13__big_token provides for` the ratio of a distance between the first_seal and the second_seal to a width of the bag_proper_being greater than 94 % but less than 100 %'
id
col. 8_ll._49 -53
claim 14 provides for` the ratio of a distance between the first_seal and the second_seal to a width of the bag_proper_being between 94 % and 97 % inclusive thereof'
id
col. 8_ll._54 -58

c. prosecution history
during prosecution the examiner twice rejected all of poly-americas claims as being obvious over the combination of two prior art patents-schneider u.s. patent no._7137,737 b2 and bonke u.s. patent no._5133,607 a -which teach a pull-strip bag with short_seals at the upper hem and a plastic liner bag with elastic top respectively
j.a
199-202 240-46
in poly-americas response to the second_rejection it distinguished schneider from all of the308_patents independent_claims on the basis that schneiders short_seals were not extended to reduce the bags` relaxed upper_opening_width' in relation to the` bag_proper_width' in schneider the short_seals are merely an extension of the linear side_seals with the side_seals and short_seals on each side of the bag parallel to the side_seals and short_seals on the other side of the bag
therefore because the short_seals are a linear extension of the side_seals the distance between the interior_edges of the short_seals is identical to the distance between the interior_edges of the side_seals..
thus applying applicants claimed definitions of the terms the` relaxed upper_opening_width' of schneider is the exact same as the` bag_proper_width' not less than the` bag_proper_width' as required by applicants independent_claims
j.a
272-73 emphasis added
the examiner subsequently withdrew his objection and allowed all sixteen claims
j.a
346
the examiner explained that` the prior art fails to teach elastic_drawstrings welded into the bag hem at short_seals that form an upper_opening that is smaller than the width of the bag'
j.a
282

d. district court proceedings
poly-america sued api_industries inc.` api' for infringement of claim 10 of the308_patent
among other terms the district_court construed the term` short_seal' of claim 10
poly-america proposed that` short_seal' be construed as` a seal that inseparably welds or joins the first and second_elastic_drawstrings and the first and second_panels of the bag'
j.a
32
the district_court instead adopted apis proposed construction` a seal for securing the elastic drawstring which seal is located adjacent to a side_seal and that is not substantially aligned with the side_seal but extends inwardly from the interior_edge of the side_seal'
id
the district_court explained that this construction was consistent with the specification and the prosecution_history
j.a
2-4

under the district_courts construction of short_seal the accused device would not infringe claim 10 because apis accused bags are conventional drawstring trash_bags with short_seals that are substantially aligned with the side_seal-i.e. the short_seals do not extend inwardly so the width of the relaxed upper_opening is equal to the bag_proper_width
following claim_construction poly-america stipulated to non-infringement and the district_court entered final judgment in apis favor
j.a
7
poly-america appeals the district_courts entry of judgment in favor of api
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
standard of review
where the district_courts claim_construction relies only on intrinsic evidence *1136 the construction is a legal determination reviewed de novo
teva pharm usa inc. v. sandoz inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 135_s.ct._831 840-42 -- - l.ed.2d -- -- 2015
a district_courts subsidiary fact findings about extrinsic_evidence are reviewed for clear error
id
here the district_courts claim_construction did not rely on extrinsic_evidence so our review is de novo

iii
discussion
poly-america argues that in construing the term` short_seal' to require inward_extension the district_court erred by importing limitations from embodiments described in the specification misreading the prosecution_history and ignoring principles of claim_differentiation
we disagree

claim terms are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning which is the meaning they would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1312-13 fed
cir
2005 en banc
we depart from the plain and ordinary meaning in only two instances
hill-rom servs. inc. v. stryker corp. 755_f.3d_1367 1371 fed
cir
2014
the first is when a patentee acts as his own lexicographer
id
the second is when the patentee disavows the full scope of the claim term in the specification or during prosecution
id
there is no indication or assertion of lexicography in this case
the only question is whether the inventor disavowed trash_bags with short_seals that do not extend inwardly to narrow the upper_opening_width in relation to the bag_proper_width

disavowal can be effectuated by language in the specification or the prosecution_history
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1316-17
in either case the standard for disavowal is exacting requiring clear and unequivocal_evidence that the claimed invention includes or does not include a particular_feature
see openwave sys. inc. v. apple_inc. 808_f.3d_509 513-14 fed
cir
2015 ; omega eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1323-26 fed
cir
2003
ambiguous language can not support disavowal
omega 334 f.3d at 1324 ; see also schindler elevator corp. v. otis elevator co. 593_f.3d_1275 1285 fed
cir

while disavowal must be clear and unequivocal it need not be explicit
trs
of columbia univ
v. symantec corp. 811_f.3d_1359 1363-64 fed
cir
2016
for example an inventor may disavow claims lacking a particular_feature when the specification describes` the present_invention' as having that feature
see e.g. luminara worldwide llc v. liown elecs co. 814_f.3d_1343 1353 fed
cir
2016
here the specification states that` in looking at both fig._1 and fig 2 it is important to note that one of the characteristics of the present_invention is a reduction in upper_width.. resulting from the extended_short_seals'
'308_patent col. 6_ll._11 -15 emphasis added
directing the reader to figures one and two which demonstrate the extended_short_seal_feature does not limit the import of this clear statement that describes a characteristic feature of the invention

similarly an inventor may disavow claims lacking a particular_feature when the specification distinguishes or disparages prior art based on the absence of that feature
see openwave 808 f.3d at 513-14 ; sightsound techs. llc v. apple_inc. 809_f.3d_1307 1317 fed
cir
2015
that is exactly what the specification to the308_patent does by stating that prior art bags are difficult to secure over trash_receptacle lips and explaining that the use of extended_short_seals reduces the claimed bags upper_opening making it easy to fit around a trashcan
see308_patent col. 2 ll
*1137 49-51 col. 5_ll._36 -48 col. 6_l._32 -col. 7_l._19

poly-americas reply to the examiners second_rejection of all claims also contains a clear and unmistakable disavowal of short_seals that do not extend inwardly` therelaxed upper_opening_width of schneider is the exact same as thebag_proper_width not less than thebag_proper_width as required by applicants independent_claims'
j.a
273 emphasis added
despite poly-americas contentions it is irrelevant that the terms` bag_proper_width' and` relaxed upper_opening_width' are not present in claim 10 because when considered in light of the specification it is clear that all of the claimed trash_bags have a` relaxed upper_opening_width' and a` bag_proper_width'
see308_patent col. 6_ll._11 -27
ultimately the only meaning that matters in claim_construction is the meaning in the context of the patent
see trs
of columbia univ. 811 f.3d at 1365

the district_courts analysis does not involve importing limitations from embodiments described in the specification
every embodiment described in the specification has inwardly extended_short_seals and every section of the specification indicates the importance of inwardly extended_short_seals
these two facts provide together a proper reason to limit the claims in this way
moreover even if these indications were not themselves sufficient they when taken together with the statements from the308_patents specification and prosecution_history identified above provide clear and unequivocal_evidence that the inventor intended to disavow any claim_scope encompassing short_seals that are not inwardly extended

poly-america argues that requiring the short_seals in claim 10 to be inwardly extended would render redundant dependent claim 13s provision for` a distance between the first_seal and the second_seal to a width of the bag_proper_being greater than 94 % but less than 100 %'
'308_patent col. 8_ll._49 -53
construing short_seals to require inward_extension would inherently provide for a distance between short_seals that is less than 100 percent of the bag_proper_width but that does not render the more specific range provided by dependent claim 13 redundant

poly-america also argues that because other independent and dependent claims explicitly provide for reduced upper_opening_width claim_differentiation principles preclude importing that limitation into claim 10 which does not contain such an explicit limitation
but claim_differentiation does not serve to broaden claims beyond their meaning in light of the patent as a whole and it can not override clear statements of claim_scope found in the specification and prosecution_history

iv
conclusion
the308_patent clearly and unequivocally disavows claims comprising short_seals that do not extend inwardly
therefore the district_court correctly construed the terms` short_seal' to require inward_extension and correctly entered judgment in favor of api
