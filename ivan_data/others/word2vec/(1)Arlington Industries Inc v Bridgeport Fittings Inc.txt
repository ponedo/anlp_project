arlington_indus. inc. v. bridgeport_fittings inc. no._399-cv-1857 m.d.pa
july_24,_2002
bridgeport argues that the district_court erroneously construed three claim_limitations and that these errors rendered the courts jury_instructions prejudicially erroneous
because in each of the constructions it advances on appeal bridgeport improperly seeks to import limitations from the specification into the claims and otherwise fails to persuade the court that the jury_instructions contained prejudicial_error we affirm both the judgment and the amended permanent_injunction

i
background
a
initial activities
in addition to other products bridgeport and arlington competitively make and supply electrical_box_extenders
in 1995_or_1996 thomas j. gretz` gretz' an employee of arlington and other officials from arlington met with william mcshane` mcshane' a representative of mcshane_industries a third competitor
mcshane held two issued united states patents nos._5042,673` ¡¬673_patent` and 5,117,996` ¡¬996_patent` both directed to electrical_box_extensions
the mcshane_box_extenders were described in the mcshane patent specifications as comprising a` generally tubular_body.. sized to receive an electrical_device.. and to be received within an existing electrical_box'
¡¬ 673 patent col._2,_ll._28-33 ; ¡¬996_patent col._2,_ll._28-33
embodiments of the patented box extensions disclosed in the ¡¬673 and ¡¬996_patent s are shown below

*1320. ?
mcshane_industries sold what it characterized as a commercial embodiment of the ¡¬673_patent under the designation` dadj'
the dadj_device is depicted below

*1321. ?
the arlington officials met with mcshane to review mcshanes dadj_box_extender as a possible addition to arlingtons product line
arlington ultimately chose not to distribute the dadj_product

b
the patent in suit
on december 27 1996 gretz filed with the united states patent and trademark office` pto' application serial number 08/773,413` ¡¬413 application' the patent_application that ultimately issued as the ¡¬674_patent
this application was a continuation-in-part of an application gretz submitted on june_20,_1996
each of the applications is directed to an electric_box_extender which is used to bring electrical_boxes flush with newly installed sheet stock in a renovated building
as described the box_extender is provided with` wings' that` tend to flex inwardly' when the box_extender is inserted into an existing electrical_box
¡¬674_patent col._4,_l._36
this flexing allows the box_extender to` accommodat [ e ] a wide_range of sizes of electrical_boxes'
id.at col._4,_ll._38-39
an embodiment of the patented box_extender is depicted below

*1322. ?
the` background of the invention' section of both specifications discussed prior_art_box_extenders in general terms including the type of box_extender typified by the dadj
gretz did not however disclose either the mcshane_patents themselves or the details of the dadj_box_extender to the pto

both co-pending applications were rejected as obvious over a combination of references including united states patent no._4134,636` kleinatland'
gretz then submitted an amendment with accompanying argument in both cases distinguishing inter_alia kleinatland
after the examiner indicated that the pending claims in the ¡¬413_patent were allowable gretz expressly abandoned the earlier application
the examiner then allowed all claims of the ¡¬413 application and on april_7,_1998 it issued to gretz as the ¡¬674_patent
the ¡¬674_patent was then assigned by gretz to arlington

the claims at issue are reproduced below with the disputed limitations underlined
1
a plastic electrical_box_extender for extending existing electrical_boxe [ sic ] so that the extended_electrical_box is flush with a surface_comprising a face_member having an outward_side and an inward_side and an axis through the center of said face_member ; at least two flanges extending from and coplanar with said face_member ; a plurality of inwardly extending flat_wings each having a base and with a base_edge an inward_edge opposite said base_edge and two side_edges opposite one another with said wings extending from the inward_side of said face said wings symmetrically disposed about said axis through the center of said face_member said wings and said face forming a generally tubular_body_portion sized to receive an electrical_device said wings capable of flexing about said base toward said axis through said face thereby allowing said tubular_body_portion to be received within existing electrical_box ; and
apertures through at least two of said flanges said apertures capable of passing screws_therethrough for securing said electrical_box_extender to said existing electrical_box
*1323 15
a one-piece plastic electrical_box_extender for extending existing electrical_boxe [ sic ] so that the extended_electrical_box is flush with a newly installed surface_comprising a face_member having an outward_side and an inward_side and an axis through the center thereof ; at least two flanges extending from and coplanar with said face_member ; a plurality of sides extending from said inward_side of said face_member each having a base_end with a base_edge and an inward_edge opposite said base_edge two side_edges with said sides symmetrically disposed about said axis through the center of said face_member said sides and said face_member forming a generally tubular_body_portion sized to receive an electrical_device said sides capable of flexing about said base toward said axis through said face_member thereby allowing said tubular_body_portion to be received within an existing electrical_box ; corners connecting said side_edges of said sides which are adjacent_one another with said sides furthermore capable of having their corners removed to increase the degree of flexing about said base toward said axis through said face_member to increase the amount of flexibility ; and
apertures through at least two of said flanges said apertures capable of passing screws_therethrough for securing said electrical_box_extender to said existing electrical_box

proceedings before the district court
on october 21 1999 arlington filed a patent infringement suit against bridgeport alleging that bridgeports box_extender product depicted below infringed the ¡¬674_patent

*1324. ?
in its answer bridgeport counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of invalidity of unenforceability based on inequitable_conduct and of noninfringement

in early december 2000 when gretz was asked during a deposition whether the wings of the dadj_box_extender` flexed about the base' as that expression was used in the ¡¬674_claims gretz stated that the wings` bell [ ied ] in' or` flex [ ed ] inwardly'
trial tr. vol
1_at_158 -59
later that month while the bridgeport suit was pending arlington submitted to the pto a request for ex parte reexamination of the ¡¬674_patent
the prior_art_references arlington supplied with the request included the mcshane_patents a brochure describing the dadj_device and the kleinatland patent that had been applied during prosecution
an exemplar of the dadj_box_extender itself was not submitted to the pto with the request for reexamination
the pto denied arlingtons request on march_16,_2001 ruling that the prior_art did not` raise a substantial_new_question of patentability' because it` fails to disclose any features which have not been previously considered in the examination of patent_application no._08 /773,413'

on october 25 2001 the district_court handed down its markman order in which it largely adopted arlingtons proposed construction of the disputed claim_limitations
this ruling was the basis for *1325 the claim_construction portions of the jury_instructions to which bridgeport objected
trial tr. vol
5_at_7
after a four-day trial the jury returned a verdict for arlington
it found literal infringement of claims 1_and_15 of the ¡¬674_patent by bridgeport
the jury also rejected bridgeports assertions that claim 1 and claim 15 were invalid as indefinite as anticipated by the dadj_box_extender or as obvious over a combination of inter_alia any two of the dadj_device the mcshane_¡¬673_patent and kleinatland
finally the jury found that neither gretz nor arlingtons patent attorney had committed inequitable_conduct in prosecuting the ¡¬674_patent
the district_court entered a final_judgment on the jurys verdict on june_25,_2002 and issued an amended permanent_injunction on july_24,_2002
bridgeport timely appealed the final_judgment the denial of its motion for partial summary judgment of claim_interpretation and the order entering the amended permanent_injunction
bridgeport does not challenge the jury findings on the issues of invalidity and inequitable_conduct

c. standard of review

analysis
a
`` capable of flexing' in its instructions to the jury the district_court construed the claim_limitation` capable of flexing' in claims 1_and_15 to mean` a generalized_combination of cantilever bending and bowing about the general_area of the base or base_end'
trial tr. vol
5_at_120
bridgeport takes issue with the district_courts construction
it argues that the court erred in construing the` capable of flexing' limitation of claims 1_and_15 to encompass anything more than` cantilever_flexing'
it is unclear precisely what` cantilever_flexing' means as used by bridgeport but we infer from bridgeports arguments that it uses the phrase to mean a specific type of flexing bending of a rigid wing or side solely about its base_end connection without other bending or bowing

claim terms are presumed to be given their ordinary and customary_meaning
johnson_worldwide assocs. inc. v. zebco corp. 175_f.3d_985 989 fed.cir.1999
the context of the surrounding words in a claim also must be considered in determining the ordinary and customary_meaning of a disputed claim_limitation
brookhill-wilk 1 llc v. intuitive surgical inc. 334_f.3d_1294 1300 fed.cir.2003
the intrinsic_record comprising the claims the written description and the prosecution_history if in evidence` must be examined in every case to determine whether the presumption of ordinary and *1326 customary_meaning is rebutted'
tex
digital sys. 308 f.3d at 1204
a patentee may rebut this presumption by` defin [ ing ] claim_terminology in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary_meaning' biovail corp. int l v. andrx pharms. inc. 239_f.3d_1297 1301 fed.cir.2001 or by disclaiming a particular_interpretation of a claim_term during prosecution biodex 946 f.2d at 863

we begin with the ordinary and customary_meaning of the terms used in the claim_limitation at issue
johnson_worldwide 175 f.3d at 989
the verb` flex' is defined as` to bend'
random house unabridged dictionary 733 2d ed
1993
the ordinary and customary_meaning of` capable of flexing' is thus simply` capable of bending'
neither party disputes that the ordinary and customary_meaning of the term` flexing' encompasses not only cantilever_flexing but also bowing or bending
bridgeport concedes that` the termflexing standing alone would connote a wide_range of movements'
accordingly we begin with the broad meaning of the term and look to the intrinsic_record to determine whether anything in that record overcomes the presumption that` flexing' has this broad ordinary_meaning
see tex
digital sys. 308 f.3d at 1204

1
claim language
bridgeport first turns to the language of the claims themselves
the` capable of flexing' limitation describes the wings in claim 1 or sides in claim 15 which are said to be` capable of flexing about said base toward said axis through said face'
¡¬674_patent col._6,_ll._47-49 ; col._8,_ll._26-27
in claim 15 this limitation is followed by the following claim_language` corners connecting said side_edges of said sides.. with said sides furthermore capable of having their corners removed to increase the degree of flexing about said base toward said axis through said face_member'
id.at col._8,_ll._31-35
bridgeports view of the effect of the removable corners limitation of claim 15 on the proper construction of the` capable of flexing' limitation differs from that of the district_court

the district_court based its construction of` flexing' in part on the fact that in claim 15 the corners of the box_extender` need not be removed' and that if the corners are not removed` it is fair to say that.. cantilever_flexing can not exist'
arlington_indus. inc. v. bridgeport_fittings inc. no._3 cv-99-1857 slip op.at 8-9 m.d.pa
oct._25,_2001` memorandum'
the court noted that claim 15 provides that the corners are capable of being` removed to increase the degree of flexing'
¡¬674_patent col._8,_ll._33-34
this indicated to the district_court that` the corners can be removed.. [ to ] provide cantilever_flexing where there was none before'
memorandum slip op.at 9

bridgeport argues that corners` removed to increase the degree of flexing' mandate a different construction of` flexing'
according to bridgeport the reference to an` increase' in the degree of flexing means only a change in the amount of flexing not in the type of flexing as the district_court held
bridgeport notes that` nothing in the claim_language or the specification suggests bowing'
it also speculates that the corners depicted in the embodiment to which claim 15 pertains are` specially designed to fold in on themselves to permit cantilever_flexingabout said base
`` it is unclear what basis bridgeport has for this speculation
there is no reference in the specification to corners that are specially designed to permit folding
the specification states that the corner_walls` may be trimmed away to create an extender with wings' and figure 7 depicts` cut lines' that may be employed for this purpose but there is no indication that the corner_walls are designed to facilitate folding in an uncut state as bridgeport suggests
we see no *1327 reason to read the words` increase [ in ] the degree of flexing' in the manner argued by bridgeport and decline to find error in the district_courts construction of` flexing' on this basis

2
written description
bridgeport next contends that the meaning of` flexing' must be limited to cantilever_flexing because the written description` teaches only cantilever_flexing'
bridgeport draws our attention to the` description of the invention' section where the` flexing of the wings' is described as a` cantilever bending'
¡¬674_patent col._4,_ll._1-2
bridgeport equates this` cantilever bending' with` cantilever_flexing' and essentially invites us to import a limitation from the preferred_embodiments to restrict the meaning of a claim_term
we have consistently warned against this approach to claim_construction which is seldom justified
see amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313 1325 fed.cir.2003` because the claims are best understood in light of the specification of which they are a part.. courts must take extreme care when ascertaining the proper scope of the claims lest they simultaneously import into the claims limitations that were unintended by the patentee
`` ; ccs_fitness inc. v. brunswick corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1366 fed.cir.2002 holding that the presumption of ordinary_meaning can not be rebutted` simply by pointing to the preferred embodiment or other structures or steps disclosed in the specification or prosecution_history'
there is no indication in the written description of the ¡¬674_patent for example that gretz` acted as his own lexicographer and clearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim_term'
ccs_fitness 288 f.3d at 1366
nor do we discern therein any express disclaimer of a particular meaning of` flexing'
see id.at 1367 ; biodex 946 f.2d at 863
we accordingly decline bridgeports invitation to restrict the meaning of the claim_term based on the description of the preferred_embodiments

3
prosecution history
a. kleinatland
turning to the prosecution_history of the ¡¬674_patent bridgeport argues that gretz disclaimed non-cantilever_flexing in arguments he made to distinguish prior_art_references
bridgeport principally relies on the argument distinguishing kleinatland that gretz submitted in the course of prosecuting the ¡¬674_patent
as depicted in the figure below kleinatland disclosed an electrical_outlet_box 12 together with an extension_plate 14 having` a center tubular flange portion sized for telescopic_engagement with [ the ] outlet_box'
kleinatland col._2,_ll._49-50
in the tubular flange portion the side walls were connected to one another through their entire length

*1328. ?
the examiner rejected gretzs application as obvious over a combination of references including kleinatland
in his response gretz distinguished the kleinatland box_extender in the following terms there is no teaching in kleinatland_et_al providing an electrical_box_extender for extending electrical_boxes so that the extender is flush with a newly installed surface
there are no plurality of inwardly extending flat_wings which flex about a face to allow the extender to be received within an existing electrical_box
in kleinatland_et_al the box is a relatively rigid telescoping member
bridgeport sees in this a redefinition of` flexing' to exclude bowing or bending
in the course of prosecuting a patent_application a patentee may redefine a claim_term
biovail 239 f.3d at 1301` [ w ] e review both the specification and applicable prosecution_history to determine whether the patentee defined claim_terminology in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary_meaning
`` ; hockerson-halberstadt inc. v. avia group int l inc. 222_f.3d_951 955 fed.cir.2000` the court.. must examine a patents specification and prosecution_history to determine whether the patentee has given the term an unconventional meaning`
an amendment or argument made in the course of prosecution may also serve as a disclaimer of a particular_interpretation of a claim_term
ekchian v. home depot inc. 104_f.3d_1299 1304 fed.cir.1997` [ s ] ince by distinguishing the claimed invention over the prior_art an applicant is indicating what the claims do not cover he is by implication surrendering such protection
`` ; southwall techs. inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1576 fed.cir.1995` the prosecution_history limits the interpretation of claim_terms so as to exclude any interpretation that was disclaimed during prosecution.. claims may not be construed one way in order to obtain their *1329 allowance and in a different way against accused infringers`
we are not persuaded that arlingtons arguments distinguishing kleinatland operate either as a redefinition of the claim_term` flexing' or as a disclaimer of any particular_interpretation of that term

as shown above kleinatland discloses an electrical_outlet_box and extension_plate
the extension_plate` is a rigid molded plastic insulator member having a center flange portion sized for telescopic_engagement with [ the ] outlet_box'
kleinatland col._4,_ll._59-61
the extension_plates described in the kleinatland specification are shaped to be accommodated within the outlet_boxes
there is no indication in kleinatland that the` rigid' extension_plates are intended to flex bow bend or give in any manner to accommodate differently sized outlet_boxes
gretzs description of the kleinatland_device as` a relatively rigid telescoping member' was thus factually accurate and does not amount to a redefinition of` flexing' or a disclaimer of any part of the ordinary_meaning of that term
nor did gretzs reference to the lack in kleinatland of` inwardly extending flat_wings which flex about a face to allow the extender to be received within an existing electrical_box' operate as a redefinition or disclaimer
as noted above there is no indication in kleinatland that the extension_plates flexed or yielded at all and that is the gravamen of the argument
the reference to the` wings' set forth in one of the arlington embodiments simply emphasizes the lack of any reference to flexing in kleinatland and can not be taken as a disclaimer of everything other than cantilever_flexing of separate wings as bridgeport would have it

b. reexamination request
the arguments made by arlington in its reexamination request relating to the mcshane_patents and the dadj_device described in the mcshane_brochure also fall short of a redefinition or disclaimer
as in the kleinatland_device the box_extenders described in the mcshane documents include a tubular_body` sized.. to be received within an electrical_box'
¡¬673_patent col._7,_ll._32-33 ; ¡¬996_patent col._6,_l._68- col._7,_l._1
there is no indication in any of the mcshane_references that the tubular_body was designed to flex or yield in order to be accommodated within differently sized_electrical_boxes
indeed mcshane provided for different box extension sizes and shapes to fit different boxes` [ t ] he electrical_box_extension of the present_invention can be manufactured for use with an electrical_box of any shape or dimensions'
¡¬ 673 patent col._6,_ll._35-37
the specification shows examples of such specially manufactured box extensions for use with cylindrical or multi-outlet_boxes
id.at col._6,_ll._37-48
the tubular_body of the mcshane_patents is also designed specifically to avoid contact with the box
it has a taper to allow it to be` easily.. inserted' into the electrical_box in a manner that makes the body` less likely to be obstructed by rough edges indentations out-of-line-knockouts broken-off or short screws or the like'
id.at col._4,_ll._29-34 ; ¡¬996_patent col._4,_ll._21-24
in the request for reexamination arlington asserted that` [ t ] here is no flexing of the sides or walls involved in the mcshane_box_extenders and they are not capable of flexing about the base'
it also stated that` the four sides or walls are substantially rigid'
both mcshane_patents state that the tubular_body can be made of plastic
¡¬673_patent col._9,_l._2 ; ¡¬996_patent col._7,_l._37
however arlingtons characterizations of the mcshane_references are accurate in light of the lack of any discussion of flexing of the tubular_body in those references and we see therein no disclaimer or redefinition affecting the scope of the claim_term` flexing'

*1330 gretzs testimony that the dadj_box_extender` bell [ ied ] out' or` flexed inwardly' to some degree when it was subjected to pressure may have prompted arlington to request reexamination of the ¡¬674_patent in light of the written references relating to the dadj_device namely the mcshane_patents and brochure
although gretzs testimony was before the district_court during the markman hearing it is of little consequence in the claim_construction analysis
that analysis must be based primarily on the record established at the time the patent was granted
see tex
digital sys. 308 f.3d at 1202` when a patent is granted prosecution is concluded the intrinsic_record is fixed and the public is placed on notice of its allowed claims
`` ; vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1583 fed.cir.1996` the claims specification and file history rather than extrinsic evidence constitute the public record of the patentees claim a record on which the public is entitled to rely`
moreover gretzs testimony does not appear to be inconsistent with arlingtons characterization of the box_extender disclosed in the mcshane_references
arlington characterized the sides or walls of the mcshane devices as` substantially rigid'
the fact that the sides of the device are caused to bow when sufficient pressure is applied does not mean that they are not` substantially rigid'
indeed the fact that the dadj_device introduced into evidence at the trial broke when a witness tried to cause it to flex proves the very point that the sides of the dadj_device were` substantially rigid'
trial tr. vol
4_at_95

invalidity
finally bridgeport argues that the broad construction of the` capable of flexing' limitation must be erroneous because it renders the claims invalid in light of prior_art_box_extenders
specifically bridgeport argues that the district_courts construction renders the ¡¬674_claims obvious over a combination of the mcshane_patents and kleinatland
arlington counters that because bridgeport has not challenged the jurys finding that the ¡¬674_patent is not invalid in view of those prior_art_references bridgeport has waived any argument that the content of the references limit the terms of the claims

arlingtons waiver argument is unavailing
the mcshane and kleinatland prior_art_references are of record in the prosecution_history and may be consulted in the process of claim_construction for what they indicate about the state of the prior_art
see tate access floors inc. v. interface architectural res. inc. 279_f.3d_1357 1371_n._4_(fed.cir.2002)` prior art cited in the prosecution_history falls within the category of intrinsic evidence`
however bridgeport does not establish that the district_courts construction of` capable of flexing' renders any claim of the ¡¬674_patent invalid
its invalidity argument is chiefly based on a repetition of the assertion we have not found persuasive namely that the dadj_device` did in fact flex orbow when pressure was applied to the sides'
bridgeport also asserts that the mcshane_¡¬673_patent discloses an embodiment allegedly depicted in figure 7 of that patent that` is used to function in the same way as the ¡¬674_patent -i.e. to flex to fit a variety of different shaped and sized_electrical_boxes without using multiple screws and brackets'
however that embodiment simply indicates that` such boxes can be provided alone or together with or assembled with electrical_box_extensions of the present_invention for use in new construction or the like'
¡¬673_patent col._7,_ll._10-13
there is no indication that this embodiment contemplates the use of a single box_extender with electrical_boxes of different shapes and sizes as bridgeport contends

*1331 5
conclusion
the district_courts construction of` flexing' as` a generalized_combination of cantilever bending and bowing about the general_area of the base or base_end' is consistent with the ordinary and customary_meaning of` flexing' which is` bending'
because bridgeport has not established that the district_courts construction is in error based on the claim_language the written description the prosecution_history or the prior_art we decline to disturb that construction on appeal

b
`` base' /' base end' the district_court construed the term` base' in claim 11 to refer to` the general_area that lies beneath the face_member of each wing or side where the flexing occurs rather than a structurally distinguishable_finite_section of each wing'
trial tr. vol
5_at_120
similarly the court construed the term` base_end' in claim 15 to mean` a general_area of each side rather than a structurally distinguishable_finite_section of each side'
id
bridgeport maintains that the meaning of these terms is facially unclear and advocates recourse to the specification to supplement the allegedly deficient claim_language
bridgeport contends that resort to the specification establishes that the` only legitimate construction ofbase_end` is` a structurally distinguishable finite section of each of the plurality of the wings or sides'

we do not accept bridgeports premise that the use of` base' or` base_end'`so deprive [ s ] the claim of clarity as to require resort to the other intrinsic evidence for a definite meaning'
ccs_fitness 288 f.3d at 1367 quoting johnson_worldwide 175 f.3d at 990
bridgeport simply asserts that the terms are unclear ; it does not explain why one of ordinary_skill in the art would not be able to understand what was signified by those terms
because we do not find the terms at issue unclear we decline to resort to the specification to supplant the ordinary_meaning of those terms and find no error in the district_courts construction

c.` corners' finally bridgeport challenges the district_courts construction of the` corners' limitation of claim 15
this limitation appears in the following context` corners connecting said side_edges of said sides which are adjacent_one another with said sides furthermore capable of having their corners removed to increase the degree of flexing about said base toward said axis through said face_member to increase the amount of flexibility'
¡¬674_patent col._8,_ll._31-36
the district_court construed this limitation as follows the word corners in claim 15 refers to the meeting place of two lines or surfaces
they are capable of being removed to increase flexing
the corners can be removed but need not be removed
the corners are removable but there is no requirement that the corners contain cut lines score_lines or other_physical_features indicating that the corners are intended to be removed
trial tr. vol
5_at_120
bridgeport maintains again on the basis of an embodiment described in the specification that` [ t ] he *1332 only correct construction.. is that the corners must be specially constructed to flex or to be cut or removed toincrease the degree of flexing
`` bridgeports attempt to read in limitations from the specification and its general assertion that the district_courts construction causes validity problems and is thus erroneous fail for the same reasons described above
we find no error in the district_courts construction of this limitation

conclusion
the district_court did not err in its construction of the claim_limitations on appeal
the jury_instructions incorporating those constructions were thus not prejudicially erroneous
likewise we find no error in the entry of the amended permanent_injunction
the district_courts judgment and the amended permanent_injunction are accordingly

affirmed

dyk circuit_judge concurring in part and dissenting in part
i agree that the judgment should be affirmed
however i respectfully dissent from the majoritys construction of` capable of flexing' limitation in claim 1 of the ¡¬674_patent
the majoritys claim_construction allows the patentee to claim the very device disclaimed in the course of patent prosecution a result plainly at odds with our precedent
however i would affirm on the ground that the appellant did not preserve this error in its objection to the jury_instruction

the contested limitation of claim 1 of the ¡¬674_patent requires that the device have a plurality of wings` capable of flexing about said base'
in its request for reexamination arlington distinguished claim 1 of the ¡¬674_patent from the mcshane_patents and the dadj_device described in the mcshane_brochure which was also before the examiner as follows there is no flexing of the wings involved in the mcshane_box_extenders
the wings or sides are not capable of flexing about the base
the four wings of the electric_box_extender are substantially rigid
there is no adjustability by flexing of the wings designed into the mcshane_box_extenders to allow the tubular_body_portions to be received in an existing electrical_box
the mcshane_box_extenders telescope into the electrical_box without engaging the sides or walls
( emphasis added
the examiner relied on this statement to deny the request for reexamination finding that the newly cited mcshane_references did not` raise a substantial_new_question of patentability' as to the claims of the ¡¬ 674 patent

the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer` limits the interpretation of claims so as to exclude any interpretation that may have been disclaimed or disavowed during prosecution in order to obtain claim allowance'

cyanamid co. 774_f.2d_448 452 fed.cir.1985
arguments made in a reexamination proceeding will constitute a disclaimer of claim scope if they are` clear and unmistakable statements of disavowal'
see cordis corp. v. medtronic ave inc. 339_f.3d_1352 1358 fed.cir.2003

here arlington has unmistakably disclaimed box_extenders like those disclosed in the mcshane_patents and the mcshane_brochure featuring the dadj_device because they are not capable of flexing about the base as claim 1 requires
the question then is-what is the extent of this disclaimer ?
in other words` [ w ] e must determine what one of ordinary_skill in the art would believe to have been disclosed' by the disclaimed references
*1333 pall corp. v. pti tech. inc. 259_f.3d_1383 1393 fed.cir.2001 vacated on other grounds 535_u.s._1109 122_s.ct._2324 153_l.ed.2d_152_(2002)

at trial there was undisputed testimony from both the inventor and arlingtons expert that the dadj_product a device embodying the mcshane_patents and disclosed in the mcshane_brochure was capable of bowing
gretz the inventor of the ¡¬674_patent testified that when the dadj_product was inserted` [ t ] he body portion bowed in'
likewise despite the statements in arlingtons request for reexamination regarding the inflexibility of the mcshane device arlingtons expert testified that the dadj_product was capable of bowing

bridgeports counsel [ i ] f you apply pressure to the end walls of the dadj_product it does flex does it not ?
witness you can see.. it flex to a modest degree yes
bridgeports counsel [ w ] hen you pressed on the walls of the dadj there was some cantilever bending correct-is n't that correct ?
witness no sir there is not
there is a slight bowing that takes place

tr. vol
2_at_102 -03
the majority notes that there is no indication in the mcshane_references themselves that the disclosed extender boxes or the dadj_product were designed to flex
ante at 1329
but even if this is true the uncontradicted testimony of arlingtons experts establishes that one of skill in the art would recognize that the dadj_device embodying the references that were before the examiner was capable of bowing
under these circumstances arlington disclaimed a device that merely bowed but did not flex about the base
see pall 259 f.3d at 1383 holding that the relevant inquiry is what one of ordinary_skill in the art would believe to have been disclosed by the prior_art
therefore the claim_term` capable of flexing about said base' must be construed to require something more than bowing
rather it must be construed to require flexing about the base

the district_court instructed the jury that the` capable of flexing' limitation in claims 1_and_15 means` a generalized_combination of cantilever bending and bowing about the general_area of the base or base_end'
trial tr. vol
5_at_120
while confusing the instruction appears to permit the jury to find that the` capable of flexing' limitation is satisfied by mere bowing
to that extent the instruction was erroneous

bridgeport objected to the instruction but its proposed alternative did not in fact eliminate the reference to bowing ; rather it simply offered a more precise_definition of` cantilever bending' namely that` [ t ] he flexing of each of the wings about its respective base_end is a cantilever_flexing'
however the error lay not in the failure to provide a more precise_definition of cantilever bending but in including the reference to bowing.`
'to prevail the party challenging a jury_instruction must demonstrate both that the jury_instructions actually given were fatally flawed and that the requested instruction was proper and could have corrected the flaw

bridgeport argues that the claim_term should be` base_end' in claim 1 as well as in claim 15 because the word` and' following` base' in claim 1 is allegedly a typographical error introduced by the pto
we must take the claim as we find it however
see cardiac pacemakers inc. v. st. jude med. inc. 296_f.3d_1106 1115 fed.cir.2002` [ t ] his court will not rewrite claims`
the proper method of addressing this alleged error would be to seek a certificate of correction under 35 u.s.c.¡± 254
in any case the difference in terminology has no substantive impact on our analysis
