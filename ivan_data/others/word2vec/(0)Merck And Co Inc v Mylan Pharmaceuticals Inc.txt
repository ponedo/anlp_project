opinion
pauline newman circuit_judge
merck & co. inc. appeals from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of pennsylvania1 wherein the court granted summary_judgment that mylan_pharmaceuticals inc. did not infringe mercks united states patents nos._4832,957957_patent and 4,900,755755_patent
the judgment is affirmed

background
the957 and755_patent s are directed to a controlled release_formulation of a combination of the drugs levodopa and carbidopa used to treat parkinsons disease
this combination of drugs was known for this use but when used in an immediate release_formulation the combination was subject to side_effects such as` wearing-off' and` on-off' phenomena
it was known that the controlled release of levodopa and carbidopa over a period of time ameliorates these side_effects and that certain polymeric vehicles implement controlled release

according to the patents in suit the desired controlled release is achieved by delivering these drugs in a polymer_vehicle the specific composition of which is the issue in this dispute
in mercks957_patent claim 1 the broadest_claim recites a combination of carbidopa and levodopa in a combination of polymers that comprises 5-25 mg of hydroxypropyl_cellulose hpc and 2-50 mg of polyvinyl_acetate-crotonic_acid pvaca 1
a controlled release_oral_dosage_formulation comprising a uniform_dispersion of 25-100 mg of carbidopa 100_to_400 mg of levodopa 1-10 mg of a tablet_lubricant and in mixture thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable_dye in a polymer_vehicle comprising 5-25 mg of water-soluble_hydroxypropyl_cellulose [ hpc ] polymer and 2-50 mg of a less_water-soluble_polyvinyl_acetate-crotonic_acid [ pvaca ] copolymer whereby following administration the carbidopa and levodopa are released slowly and simultaneously from the formulation
( emphasis and acronyms added

the755_patent is a division of the957_patent and claims the same combination polymer_vehicle 1
a controlled release_oral_dosage_formulation comprising a uniform_dispersion of 25-100 mg of carbidopa and 100_to_400 mg of levodopa in a polymer_vehicle comprising 5-25 mg of a water-soluble_hydroxypropyl_cellulose [ hpc ] polymer and 2-50 mg of a less_water-soluble_polyvinyl_acetate-crotonic_acid [ pvaca ] copolymer whereby following administration the carbidopa and levodopa are released slowly and simultaneously from the formulation

mylan filed an abbreviated new drug application with the food and drug administration for a product containing 50 mg of carbidopa 200 mg of levodopa 29.3 mg of water-soluble hpc polymer and 12.8 mg of hydroxypropyl_methylcellulose hpmc
merck brought suit pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a 2 charging mylan with infringement under the doctrine of *1338 equivalents of claims 1-3 of each of the957 and755_patent s. no charge of literal infringement was made for mylans polymer_vehicle is not identical to that of the claims
however merck asserts that the polymer_vehicle in mylans product 29.3 mg of hpc and 12.8 mg of hpmc is equivalent to mercks claimed polymer_vehicle 5-25 mg of hpc and 2-50 mg of pvaca
merck states that any difference is insubstantial in that the hpmc and pvaca are interchangeable in this use for both are less_water-soluble than hpc

mylan moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement arguing that the prosecution histories of the957 and755_patent s estopped merck from asserting that mylans product infringed under the doctrine of equivalents and also that the prior_art prevented application of the doctrine of equivalents to reach mylans formulation
the district_court granted summary_judgment of non-infringement holding that both prosecution_history_estoppel and the prior_art preclude a finding of equivalency
this appeal followed

we review de novo the correctness of the grant of summary_judgment including the issues of estoppel and the effect of the prior_art on application of the doctrine of equivalents

i
prosecution history estoppel
the district_court ruled that merck had surrendered coverage of a hpc/hpmc_polymer_vehicle during prosecution by amending and narrowing the claims in response to the examiners rejection of mercks broad claims on the ground of obviousness in view of certain prior_art
the prosecution of mercks patents involved four patent applications the initial_application ; two continuation-in-part_applications on the second of which the957_patent issued ; and a divisional that led to the757_patent

a
the broadest_claim of the initial_application was directed to a carbidopa-levodopa combination in a polymer_vehicle that comprised broadly a combination of a water soluble and a less_water_soluble_polymer as follows emphasis added a controlled release_oral_dosage_formulation comprising a uniform_dispersion of 5-300 mg of carbidopa 2-1200 mg of levodopa 0-25 mg of a tablet_lubricant and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable_dye in a polymer_vehicle comprising 0-120 mg of water soluble polymer and 0-120 mg of a less_water_soluble_polymer with the proviso that both polymers are not 0 mg whereby following administration the carbidopa and levodopa are released slowly and simultaneously from the formulation
the examiner rejected the claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 in light of certain references including u.s
patents nos._4424,235 sheth and 4,389,393 schor
sheth describes controlled release_preparations of carbidopa and levodopa in the concentration shown by merck wherein the polymer_vehicle may be a mixture of polymers selected from a group including hpc and hpmc
the sheth_formulation also contains fatty materials for the purpose of floating the drugs in the stomach where the polymer_vehicle releases the drugs
the schor patent describes a formulation for the controlled release of a medicament using a polymer_vehicle that is a combination of hpc and hpmc
the examiner in addition to rejecting the claims under *1339 ¡± 103 required merck to make an election of species for examination purposes citing 35 u.s.c.¡± 121

merck then filed a continuation-in-part_application now claiming the polymer_vehicle in the broadest_claim in markush form a controlled release_oral_dosage_formulation comprising a uniform_dispersion of 5-300 mg of carbidopa 2-1200 mg of levodopa 0-25 mg of a tablet_lubricant and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable_dye in a polymer_vehicle comprising 0-120 mg of a water-soluble polymer selected from hydroxypropyl_cellulose [ hpc ] hydroxypropyl_methylcellulose [ hpmc ] polyvinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol starch and methyl_cellulose and 0-120 mg of a less_water_soluble_polymer selected from polyvinyl_acetate-crotonic_acid [ pvaca ] copolymer polyvinyl chloride polyethylene cellulose acetate polyvinyl alcohol ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer polyvinyl_acetate polymethyl methacrylate and ethyl cellulose with the proviso that both polymers are not 0 mg whereby following administration the carbidopa and levodopa are released slowly and simultaneously from the formulation
( emphasis and acronyms added
the examiner again rejected all of the claims under ¡± 103 citing inter alia the sheth and schor patents
the examiner also required that merck elect a single_species for further prosecution

merck then filed the second continuation-in-part_application limiting the broadest_claim to the combination of hpc and pvaca as follows a controlled release_oral_dosage_formulation comprising a uniform_dispersion of 25-100 mg of carbidopa 100_to_400 mg of levodopa 1-10 mg of a tablet_lubricant and in mixture thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable_dye in a polymer_vehicle comprising 5-25 mg of water-soluble polymer hydroxypropyl_cellulose [ hpc ] polymer and 2-50 mg of a less_water-soluble_polyvinyl_acetate-crotonic_acid [ pvaca ] copolymer whereby following administration the carbidopa and levodopa are released slowly and simultaneously from the formulation
( emphasis and acronyms added
merck explained that` [ t ] he amendment to the claims is an attempt to obviate therefrom the formal_rejections found in the parent_application'
this application issued as the957_patent

in a divisional_application merck retained the broad markush claims in claims that omitted the tablet_lubricant and the dye
upon the examiners rejections under ¡± 103 citing inter alia the sheth and schor references and the requirement that merck elect a single_species merck amended the divisional claims to recite a` polymer_vehicle comprising 5-25 mg of water-soluble_hydroxypropylcellusose [ hpc ] polymer and 2-50 mg of a less_water-soluble polyvinylacetate-crotonic_acid [ pvaca ] copolymer'
merck distinguished sheth as follows [ sheth ] does describe a sustained-release combination of levodopa and carbidopa but the design of the formulation and the components thereof differ from those of the present claims
a single polymer is used in the sheth_formulation selected from a natural gum methyl_cellulose [ hpmc ] [ hpc ] and sodium carbomethylcellulose
the claimed formulation is a combination of [ hpc ] and [ pvaca ] copolymer
merck also distinguished schor stating that schor` does not suggest the combination of [ hpc ] and [ pvaca ] copolymer as presently claimed'
the divisional_application duly issued as the755_patent with claims wherein the only polymer_vehicle was the combination of hpc and pvaca
*1340 merck did not pursue the other polymers of the markush_grouping

b
if claim_scope is relinquished during prosecution on grounds of patentability the doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel provides that the relinquished scope can not be recovered by operation of the doctrine of equivalents
warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chemical co. 520_u.s._17 30-32 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1871-72 1997 ; emi 157 f.3d at 897 48 uspq2d at 1188-89
it is necessary to ascertain what was relinquished and why to establish the extent of the estoppel
mannesmann demag corp. v. engineered metal products co. 793_f.2d_1279 1284 230_uspq_45 47-48 fed.cir.1986

merck argued to the district_court and repeats on appeal that it was compelled by the examiner to elect a species from the proposed markush genus and that it amended its claims for this reason and not because the claims were unpatentable under ¡± 103
merck argues that it simply complied with the examiners formal_requirement of an examination expedient and did not yield anything in response to the rejection on obviousness in either of the patents in suit
in bayer aktiengesellschaft v. duphar int l research b.v. 738_f.2d_1237 1243 222_uspq_649 653 fed.cir.1984 the court held that` limiting the claim because of a restriction_requirement.. would not necessarily invoke file wrapper estoppel'
see also ortho pharmaceutical corp. v. smith 959_f.2d_936 941 fed.cir.1992 infringement found under doctrine of equivalents of claims to a subgenus of a generic claim that had been subject to a restriction_requirement
according to merck once it had elected a species` the examiners rejection based on the prior_art simply became irrelevant to the prosecution'
thus merck argues that its election to prosecute a claim covering its commercial formulation when the examiner required an election of species did not effect an estoppel against equivalent polymer combinations

merck described this amendment to the examiner as` an attempt to obviate therefrom the formal_rejections found in the parent_application' and` tantamount to' an election of species
the district_court found that merck limited its claims to the particular polymer species in response to the examiners obviousness rejection notwithstanding that the examiner had also imposed a restriction_requirement
the examiner had rejected the markush claims under ¡± 103 citing sheth as` describing sustained release_preparations of levodopa and/or carbidopa' and schor as` describing a controlled release composition of embraced species of polymers for any and all oral drugs'
the polymer combination of hpc and pvaca is without dispute not suggested by sheth or schor

the determination of whether an amendment was made for purposes of patentability on grounds of obviousness is adjudged from the viewpoint of a person of skill in the field of the invention and when the issue includes consideration of formalities of patent practice experience in patent law and procedures is presumed
the court must determine what such a person would conclude from the prosecution record
see emi 157 f.3d at 898 48 uspq2d at 1189 ; modine mfg co. v. united states int l trade comm n 75_f.3d_1545 1555-56 37_uspq2d_1609 1616 fed.cir.1996
although merck carried the markush-group polymers into the divisional_application upon rejection under ¡± 103 and the formal_requirement for an election of species merck again elected the hpc/pvaca_combination
although this action also resolved the requirement of an election of species we conclude that the *1341 controlling fact is that merck no longer sought to claim any of the several other polymer_vehicles
cf
loral fairchild corp. v. sony corp. 181_f.3d_1313 1326 50_uspq2d_1865 1873 fed.cir.1999` applicant may not avoid the conclusion that an amendment was made in response to prior_art by discussing the amendment under the rubric of a clarification due to a ¡± 112 indefiniteness rejection'
we therefore conclude that the most reasonable reading of the prosecution_history is that mercks actions in limiting all of the claims of both patents to a single_species of combined polymer_vehicle without further pursuit of the broader polymer claims were primarily in consideration of the patentability_rejection under ¡± 103

thus we conclude that prosecution_history_estoppel arises
however estoppel is not automatic as to everything beyond the literal scope of the claim ; its extent must be determined from what was relinquished in light of the prior_art
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 32_n._7 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41 uspq2d at 1872_n._7_(courts_may_explore_the_manner_in_which_the_amendment_''addressed_and_avoided_the_rejection'') ; hughes aircraft co. v. united states 140_f.3d_1470 1477 46_uspq2d_1285 1289-90 fed.cir.1998 amendments made to overcome a prior_art rejection narrow the range of equivalents accordingly ; litton sys. inc. v. honeywell inc. 140_f.3d_1449 1455 46_uspq2d_1321 1325 fed.cir.1998 equivalency is determined on the facts of what was surrendered and why ; bayer 738 f.2d at 1243 222 uspq at 653` a close examination must be made as to not only what was surrendered but also the reason for the surrender'

the district_court reviewing the claim_scope that was yielded by merck referred to the polymers in the cancelled markush claim
the court found that merck` further narrowed its claims to require the two specific polymers of pvaca and hpc thereby surrendering its claims to the other five polymers specified in the water soluble polymer group and to the other eight polymers specified in the less_water soluble group'
the district_court did not discuss that both of the polymers used by mylan hpc and hpmc appeared in mercks` water soluble' group

merck argues that even if some degree of estoppel were incurred by the prosecution procedure it does not extend to mylans formulation
merck argues that although the examiner cited both sheth and schor the examiners patentability_rejection was based on the obviousness of` combining the notion of the controlled release of levodopa/carbidopa of sheth with the schor polymer_vehicle of hpmc and optionally up to 30 %_hpc' in mercks words
therefore according to merck it is only the specific formulation of schor i.e. hpmc and optionally up to 30 %_hpc that was surrendered
merck argues that this does not preclude infringement under equivalency by mylans formulation
in addition although mercks specification describes both hpc and hpmc as` water soluble' merck states that hpmc is less_water soluble than hpc and that this difference was known to the prior_art
thus merck argues that hpmc is the equivalent of the claimed` less_water soluble' pvaca and that there is no estoppel to reaching this polymer as a known interchangeable vehicle

the district_court read the prosecution_history as surrendering the polymers in the markush_group that were described in the references on which the ¡± 103 rejection was based
merck does not dispute that its markush_group encompassed mylans hpc/hpmc_polymer_vehicle
since the examiner rejected the markush claims in light of references that described a hpc/hpmc_polymer_vehicle when merck limited its claims to the hpc/pvaca_combination it became estopped as to that *1342 vehicle in the dropped claims
thus we affirm the district_courts ruling that merck is estopped to assert infringement by the hpc/hpmc combination under the doctrine of equivalents of either the957 or the755_patent

affirmed
