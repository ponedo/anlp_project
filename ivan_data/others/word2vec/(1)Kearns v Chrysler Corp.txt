background
in 1982 kearns filed an action against chrysler alleging infringement of u.s
patents 3,351,836 3,564,374 3,602,790 and 3,581,178 all relating to electronic intermittent_windshield_wipers iwws for use in automotive vehicles
at the time the suit was filed kearns had three similar suits pending against other automobile manufacturers and distributors involving the same patents kearns v. ford motor co. civil_action_no._78-70740 e.d.mich
) ; kearns v. wood_motors inc. civil_action_no._78-70642 e.d.mich
) ; swf-spezialfabrik fur autozubehor gustav rav gmbh v. kearns civil action no._79-74451 e.d.mich

on october 22 1982 proceedings in the chrysler_action were stayed pending resolution of the earlier filed suits
the stay was instituted pursuant to chryslers stipulation that it would be` bound by the judgment as to the validity of.. u.s. patent nos._3351,836 3,564,374 3,581,178 and 3,602,790' in either ford wood_motors or swf whichever was the last to be adjudicated
the stipulation expressly provided however that chrysler would` not be bound by any consent_judgment'

in 1989 shortly before the ford_case went to trial chrysler renewed its stipulation regarding the issues of invalidity and unenforceability
subject to continuation of the court-ordered stay chrysler agreed to be` bound by the judgment excluding a consent_judgment in the kearns v. ford_case c.a
78-70740 as to the validity and enforceability of the patents involved in that action that are also involved in this action
those patents included united_states patent nos._3351,836 3,564,374 3,581,178 and 3,602,790'
that stipulation was subsequently entered by the court on february 15 1990

1
the ford litigation
the liability phase of the ford_case commenced on january 3 1990
on january 29 1990 the jury returned a unanimous_verdict for kearns finding that ford had not proved by clear and convincing evidence that claim 16 of the836_patent claim 6 of the374_patent claim 14 of the790_patent and claim 6 of the178_patent were invalid or unenforceable
on march_9,_1990 the district_court entered partial_judgment that the specified claims were valid enforceable and infringed by ford
that partial_judgment was eventually` made final' upon entry of the courts final_judgment on november 14 1990

*1544 the damage phase of ford was tried before the same_jury in april 1990
the jury however was unable to reach a unanimous_verdict and a second trial on damages was held in july 1990
the second_jury ultimately returned a unanimous_verdict in favor of kearns awarding $ 5,163,842 for the period from april_3,_1978 through 1988
on july_13,_1990 partial_judgment was entered on the damage_award assessed by the second_jury
although damages for the period from 1972 to april_3,_1978 remained in dispute ford and kearns eventually reached a settlement as to the total amount of liability
consequently the partial_judgment on damages was vacated and ford withdrew its pending post-verdict motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new_trial and waived its appellate_rights

2
the chrysler litigation
the chrysler case returned to active status in early 1991
on february 20 1991 the district_court issued a pretrial_order stating that the issues to be adjudicated at trial concerned` infringement damages and willfulness'
on may_3,_1991 chrysler filed a motion to have the pretrial_order modified to add patent_validity as an issue for trial
in support of its motion chrysler argued that the pretrial_stipulations of october 15 1982 and february 15 1990 did not bar chrysler from challenging the patents in suit
chrysler claimed that because the final_judgment in ford was entered pursuant to a settlement agreement between ford and kearns it was a` consent_judgment' within the meaning of the stipulations

the district_court denied the motion and limited trial to the issues stated in the pretrial_order
in rejecting chryslers argument the district_court noted that although a settlement had been reached in ford on the issue of damages the issue of validity was` hotly' contested by the parties at trial resulting in a unanimous jury verdict and a final_judgment in favor of kearns
moreover the court found that the stipulations did not obligate ford to pursue post-trial motions and exhaust all rights of appeal in order for the judgment in ford to be binding on the parties in chrysler

by order of the court the chrysler_action was bifurcated into separate jury trials on the issues of liability and damages
on december 10 1991 the jury returned verdicts that chryslers accused iww_circuits designated the` 1977 circuit' and the` 1980 circuit' infringed claim 12 of the836_patent claim 6 of the374_patent and claim 14 of the790_patent2 on june_11,_1992 the same_jury returned a verdict that chryslers infringement was not willful and assessed a reasonable_royalty of $90 per unit for a total of 12,564,107 infringing units.3 pursuant to the jurys verdicts the district_court entered final_judgment in favor of kearns in the amount of $ 18,740,465.43 including prejudgment_interest and costs.4

chrysler subsequently filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol asserting that the jurys findings of infringement were not supported by substantial_evidence
alternatively chrysler moved for a new_trial claiming that the district_court improperly excluded evidence and misinstructed the jury on critical legal issues
the district_court denied chryslers post-verdict motions
the court considered the expert_testimony adduced at trial together with the documentary_evidence of record to be a sufficient basis upon which the jury could have supported its findings of infringement
further the court determined that the exclusion of evidence *1545 was not prejudicial to chryslers substantive_rights and that the jury was correctly instructed on the interpretation of the claims and their application to the accused circuits

discussion
chrysler now appeals asserting that the district_courts judgment should be reversed as a matter of law because the underlying jury_verdicts of infringement were not supported by substantial_evidence or in the alternative that a new_trial is warranted in view of the prejudicial error committed by the district_court in barring chrysler from introducing prior_art_evidence necessary to properly construe the claims at issue and to challenge their validity and enforceability
kearns cross-appeals certain rulings of the court that allegedly deprived him of the total compensation to which he claims he is entitled

new_trial
we first address the district_courts denial of chryslers motion for a new_trial
`` the denial of a motion for new_trial can be reversed only if the district_court abused its discretion'

denied 506_u.s._817 113_s.ct._60 121_l.ed.2d_28_(1992)
an abuse of discretion may be established by showing that the district_court either made an error of law a clear error of judgment or made findings which were clearly erroneous

1
invalidity and unenforceability
in support of its contention that a new_trial is required chrysler claims that the district_court erred as a matter of law in excluding evidence allegedly showing that the patents in suit are invalid and unenforceable
chrysler claims that the district_courts decision to exclude such_evidence was based on an erroneous interpretation of the pretrial_stipulation of february 15 1990,5 in which chrysler agreed to be bound by the judgment rendered in the ford_case on the issues of invalidity and unenforceability
it is chryslers position that the ford judgment was in fact a consent_judgment which under the terms of the stipulation was not binding on chrysler

the proper interpretation of the parties pretrial_stipulation like any contract presents a legal question that we address de novo
see intel_corp. v. ulsi sys
technology inc. 995_f.2d_1566 1569 27_uspq2d_1136 1138 fed.cir.1993 cert
denied 510_u.s._1092 114_s.ct._923 127_l.ed.2d_216_(1994)
as always our inquiry begins with the language of the agreement memorializing the intent of the parties

the controlling language of the agreement between chrysler and kearns provides that chrysler` shall be bound by the [ ford ] judgment excluding a consent_judgment.. as to the validity and enforceability' of the patents in suit
[ emphasis added ]
chrysler asserts that the existence of the` consent_judgment' exception in the stipulation indicates that it only intended to be bound by a judgment respecting invalidity and unenforceability where those issues were` fully litigated' by ford i.e. only after ford vigorously defended its position at trial and exhausted all available post-trial remedies
chrysler insists that the final_judgment entered in ford was a` consent_judgment' because the parties in that case reached a settlement on the issue of damages that effectively mooted fords post-trial motions and forced ford to forfeit its appellate_rights

*1546 we reject chryslers attempts to avoid the consequences of its stipulation by redefining its terms
the fact that ford was precluded from proceeding with its post-trial motions or seeking appellate review because of its damage settlement does not render the courts judgment a` consent_judgment'
in our effort to give effect to the original intent of the parties we adhere to the well-settled rule that words in an agreement are interpreted in accordance with their ordinary and commonly accepted meanings
see hol-gar mfg corp. v. united_states 351_f.2d_972 979 ct.cl.1965
the term` consent_judgment' is defined as` [ a ] judgment the provisions and terms of which are settled and agreed to by the parties to the action'
blacks law dictionary 842 6th ed
1990
this meaning is in contradistinction to a judgment that is rendered by a court without agreement of the parties
the commonly accepted meaning of the term` consent_judgment' prevails here because the stipulation is devoid of any indication that the parties intended a different meaning

although it is undisputed that ford settled the amount of compensation due kearns no such settlement or agreement was reached between the parties in ford respecting the issues of validity enforceability and infringement of the asserted patent claims
indeed as the trial_court noted those issues were` hotly'` vigorously' and` fully' contested by the parties during a lengthy jury trial.6 pursuant to unanimous_verdicts returned by the jury the court entered partial and later final judgment holding claim 16 of the836_patent claim 6 of the374_patent claim 14 of the790_patent and claim 3 of the936_patent valid enforceable and infringed
because neither party in ford` settled and agreed' on the issues of validity and enforceability the district_courts judgment respecting those issues was not a` consent_judgment' within the meaning of the stipulation
chrysler is thus bound by that judgment
see restatement second of judgments ¡± 40 1982` a person who agrees to be bound by the determination of issues in an action between others is bound in accordance with the terms of his agreement
``

in a further attempt to avoid the consequences of its stipulation chrysler urges that` public_policy' favors allowing it to challenge the patents validity and enforceability
even were we to agree with this proposition we do not see how it aids chrysler here
chrysler was certainly entitled to raise the defenses of invalidity and/or unenforceability when it was accused of infringement but it chose instead to rely on the judgment rendered in ford on those issues
public policy will not rescue chrysler from a decision which it later finds to be imprudently made
on the contrary public_policy favors preventing chrysler from reneging on an agreement into which it freely entered and upon which kearns and the district_court relied
see interspiro usa inc. v. figgie int l inc. 18_f.3d_927 930 30_uspq2d_1070 1072 fed.cir.1994 ; bank of america nat l trust and savings assoc
v. united_states 23_f.3d_380 382 fed.cir.1994

accordingly we agree with the district_court that chrysler was barred under the stipulation from introducing prior_art_evidence directed toward challenging the validity and enforceability of the asserted patents in this case

2
interpretation of claims
next chrysler contends that the district_court committed reversible_error by excluding prior_art_evidence allegedly essential to the proper construction of the claims at issue
as a result of that error chrysler asserts that a new_trial is warranted because the jurys infringement analysis was predicated on distorted claim interpretations

*1547` the decision to admit or exclude evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial_court and will be reversed on appeal only for a clear abuse of that discretion'
smith & lee assocs. inc. v. city of taylor mich. 13_f.3d_920 928 6th cir.1993
in order to show that the district_court abused its discretion in excluding the prior_art_evidence chrysler must demonstrate that the exclusion prejudiced its substantive_rights
see dmi inc. v. deere & co. 802_f.2d_421 428 231_uspq_276 280-81 fed.cir.1986
here chrysler has failed to make that showing

it is well-settled that reference may be had to prior_art when it will assist a court in determining how a disputed claim is understood by those skilled in the art
see palumbo v. don-joy co. 762_f.2d_969 975 226_uspq_5 8 fed.cir.1985 ; tandon corp. v. international trade comm n 831_f.2d_1017 1021 4_uspq2d_1283 1286 fed.cir.1987
however when claim language is clear and unambiguous on its face resort to prior_art may be unnecessary

whether a claim has been infringed requires first interpreting the claim and then comparing the properly construed claim to the accused device
see read corp. v. portec inc. 970_f.2d_816 821 23_uspq2d_1426 1431 fed.cir.1992
when as here prior_art is not required to resolve the underlying legal question concerning what a claim means it necessarily has little relevance to the ultimate factual question of infringement
such evidence is by definition` irrelevant' and need not be admitted by a trial_court
see fed.r.evid
401 402

at trial chrysler attempted to introduce prior_art patents ostensibly for the purpose of aiding in the interpretation of the claims at issue
specifically chrysler intended to show that under kearns interpretations of the claims the claims were impermissibly broad because they read upon or were obvious over the prior_art
the district_court however concluded that the claims could be construed according to their plain meaning and that reference to prior_art was not required.7 moreover and highly significant here the district_court believed that chryslers attempts to offer such_evidence constituted a disguised` back door' attack on the validity of the patents which was expressly proscribed by the binding stipulation

the district_courts reasoning adequately supports its refusal to admit the proffered evidence
`` [ that ] we might have reached a different result or might have affirmed had the district_court gone the other way are insufficient bases for reversal under the abuse of discretion standard which applies to our review of this part of the courts judgment'
rca corp. v. data general corp. 887_f.2d_1056 1065 12_uspq2d_1449 1457 fed.cir.1989
moreover even if the court committed error in not admitting any particular prior_art_evidence we have not been persuaded that the claims were erroneously construed and that chrysler was thereby prejudiced
the district_courts denial of chryslers motion for a new_trial is therefore affirmed

judgment as a matter of law
we now consider chryslers argument that the district_court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of infringement
chrysler contends that no substantial_evidence supports the jurys findings that chrysler literally infringed claim 14 of the790_patent claim 16 of the836_patent and claim 6 of the374_patent

`` we reverse a denial of a motion for jmol only if the jurys factual findings presumed or express are not supported by substantial_evidence or if they are that the legal_conclusions implied from the jurys verdict can not in law be supported by those *1548 findings'
arachnid inc. v. medalistic_marketing_corp. 972 f.2d at 1301 23 uspq2d at 1948 citation omitted
the` substantial_evidence' standard` requires us to decide for ourselves whether reasonable jurors viewing the evidence as a whole could have found the facts needed to support the verdict in light of the applicable law
if we conclude that no reasonable findings of fact supported by substantial_evidence could support the verdict that was incorporated into the trial_courts judgment then we must conclude that the trial_court erred in not granting the motion for [ jmol ]'

denied 506_u.s._1053 113_s.ct._976 122_l.ed.2d_131_(1993)
moreover we review the evidence in the light most favorable to kearns the nonmoving party drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor
see amsted indus inc. v. buckeye steel castings co. 24_f.3d_178 181 30_uspq2d_1462 1464 fed.cir.1994

chrysler devotes the bulk of its appeal to challenging the jurys findings that the accused circuits performed the functions required by each of the asserted means-plus-function clauses by means of structure taught in the specification or an equivalent of those structures
in doing so chrysler pays mere lip service to the substantial_evidence standard by ignoring the evidence upon which the jury reasonably relied in reaching its verdicts and by rearguing the merits of the infringement issues
an appeal however is not to be used as a means of retrying a case
see dmi 802 f.2d at 426 231 uspq at 279
under the substantial_evidence standard the appellate courts function is exhausted once a sufficient evidentiary basis is deemed to exist to support the jurys findings
see richardson v. suzuki motor co. 868_f.2d_1226 1235 9_uspq2d_1913 1919 fed.cir
) cert
denied 493_u.s._853 110_s.ct._154 107_l.ed.2d_112_(1989)

trial on the issue of infringement lasted approximately four weeks during which expert_testimony was introduced by both parties
specifically as the district_court stated` the expert_testimony first construed each of the asserted claims and then went on to describe how the chrysler_system responded to each of the elements of each of the claims..
it is this expert_testimony together with admissions in chryslers documents describing the gestation of the chrysler_system which constituted for the most part the substantial_evidence supporting the jurys verdict of infringement'
after receiving instructions on the law governing infringement of means-plus-function claims,8 the jury returned verdicts that the asserted claims were literally infringed by chryslers accused iww_circuits
each of the jurys verdicts of infringement was supported by a number of detailed special_interrogatories referred to at trial as` special_questions' that addressed specific issues that had been the focus of expert_testimony at trial.9

we have recognized that` [ t ] he use of special_interrogatories.. facilitates appellate review.. for such use frees the court from having to survey every possible basis for the jurys decision'

denied 469_u.s._821 105_s.ct._95 83_l.ed.2d_41_(1984)
the district_court in denying chryslers post-trial motions analyzed all of the special_interrogatories answered by the jury and cited evidence presented to the jury pertinent to each interrogatory including expert witness testimony
thus it is clear that the jury_verdicts were supported by substantial_evidence
the detailed *1549 nature of the special_interrogatories as well as the extensive analysis by the trial judge in considering chryslers post-trial motions are impressive indeed giving great credibility to the decisions reached

we conclude that chrysler has failed to show that on the entirety of the record reasonable persons could not have found the facts necessary to support the jurys verdicts of infringement
because substantial_evidence supports the jurys verdicts and because the legal_conclusions implied from those verdicts are consistent with the jurys findings the district_courts denial of chryslers motion for judgment as a matter of law is affirmed

cross-appeal
kearns now cross-appeals a number of rulings issued by the district_court that kearns claims precluded him from obtaining all the relief and compensation to which he was entitled under the law
at issue are the district_courts orders 1 granting chryslers motion for summary_judgment on kearns right to seek injunctive_relief 2 granting chryslers motion for summary_judgment on kearns right to recover lost profits as damages 3 denying kearns motion to disqualify chryslers counsel for conflict of interest 4 precluding kearns from challenging the number of infringing units without filing supporting documentary_evidence 5 denying kearns motion to offer separate evidence of willful_infringement by american motors 6 granting chryslers motion for a directed verdict on the issue of willfulness 7 assessing prejudgment_interest for the period from march_2,_1982 to june_11,_1992 at simple interest rather than 2 % above the prime rate and 8 awarding chrysler $ 677,332.62 for attorneys fees and expenses
we will address each of these rulings in turn to the extent necessary

1
post-expiration injunctive relief
shortly before trial kearns expanded his claim for relief to include injunctive_relief
kearns believed that chryslers infringement deprived him of the` full value' of his patents during their respective terms by effectively extinguishing his exclusive_right to sell his patented iww systems to automobile manufacturers
kearns urged that chrysler should be enjoined from manufacturing infringing iww systems for a period of sufficient duration` to put him in [ a ] position where the harm [ caused by ] past_infringement during the terms of the patents in suit is rectified'
the district_court refused to grant such_relief because the patents had already expired.10 the court concluded that` there is nothing in statute or common law giving [ kearns ] the right to an injunction against practicing the disclosures in an expired patent'

in arguing that the district_court erred in denying him post-expiration relief kearns claims that the $ 11 million damage_award is not adequate to compensate him for the loss he sustained as a result of chryslers infringement
kearns contends that chryslers infringement stripped him of` exclusive time' over his patents in violation of his rights under the u.s. constitution and the patent laws and that he is entitled to have that time restored to him
that contention however finds no basis in the statutory scheme governing patent infringement remedies

under the laws enacted by congress a patent grants the patent_owner the right to exclude others from making using or selling the claimed invention in the united_states for the term of seventeen years
35 u.s.c.¡± 154 1988
when that exclusive_right is infringed the patent_owner is authorized to obtain compensation in the form of damages measured e.g. by lost profits or a reasonable_royalty
35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 281 284 1988
moreover the statute expressly provides for the grant of injunctions` in accordance with the principles of equity'
35 u.s.c.¡± 283 1988
in view of the fact that the principal right afforded by a patent is the` right to exclude' we have noted that` [ t ] he nature of *1550 the patent grant.. weighs against holding that monetary damages will always suffice to make the patentee whole'
h.h
robertson co. v. united steel deck inc. 820_f.2d_384 387-88 2_uspq2d_1926 1930 fed.cir.1987
indeed` [ w ] hile monetary relief is often the sole_remedy for past_infringement it does not follow that a monetary award is also the sole_remedy against future infringement'
atlas powder co. v. ireco chemicals 773_f.2d_1230 1233 227_uspq_289 292 fed.cir.1985 emphasis added
however ¡± 283 relief is available only to` prevent the violations of any right secured by patent'
thus when the rights secured by a patent are no longer protectable by virtue of expiration or unenforceability entitlement to injunctive_relief becomes moot because such_relief is no longer available
see illinois tool works inc. v. grip-pak inc. 906_f.2d_679 681 15_uspq2d_1307 1308 fed.cir.1990

an invention claimed in a patent passes into the public domain upon termination of the patents 17-year statutory term
because the rights flowing from a patent exist only for the term of the patent there can be no infringement once the patent expires
here all the asserted patents expired before the commencement of trial
therefore kearns` can no longer obtain injunctive_relief with respect to [ those patents ]'
see kinzenbaw v. deere & co. 741_f.2d_383 386 222_uspq_929 931 fed.cir.1984 cert

granting the relief requested by kearns would impermissibly extend the statutory term beyond that established by congress
congress has the power to provide for patent term extension in appropriate circumstances see 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 155 156 1988 but it has not done so here and we can not legislate in its place
see denkler v. united_states 782_f.2d_1003 1008 fed.cir.1986` should congress wish to extend the [ statutes scope ] it knows how to do so`
the expiration of kearns patents precludes the grant of injunctive_relief and the judgment for $ 11 million in damages thus amounts to adequate and full compensation under the law for chryslers past violation of his patent rights

kearns argues that our decision in roche prods. inc. v. bolar pharmaceutical co. inc. 733_f.2d_858 221_uspq_937_(fed.cir.) cert
denied 469_u.s._856 105_s.ct._183 83_l.ed.2d_117_(1984) suggests that the availability of post-expiration equitable relief is simply a matter within the discretion of the trial_court
in roche the trial_court denied the patent_owners request for a permanent injunction because it found there was no infringement
although the trial_courts finding of noninfringement was reversed on appeal the request for injunctive_relief became` no longer.. necessary' because the patent had expired
despite the patents expiration the case was remanded to the lower court with directions to fashion an appropriate equitable remedy to redress the harm to the patent_owner caused by past acts of infringement
id.at 865 221 uspq at 942
kearns argues that the district_court should consider taking action similar to that contemplated in roche
kearns however is not in a position to benefit from such_relief

the post-expiration relief discussed in roche was intended to return the parties to the status quo before infringement e.g. destruction of data obtained as a result of the infringement and was not intended to prohibit future use of the invention
importantly the relief was also considered in the context of harm to a patent_owner that had been selling the patented_product
thus deferral of competition by an infringer who had entered the market prematurely i.e. before the patent expired was considered as a means of equitably compensating the patent_owner
in contrast because chrysler has been manufacturing and selling its infringing iwws for many years and kearns has not see infra there is no basis for granting relief similar to that contemplated by the court in roche

we sympathize with kearns complaint that his patents have expired without his ever being able to exclude others from practice *1551 of his invention especially since he is an individual inventor contending with a multitude of giant corporations.11 while it is of course the essence of a patent that it provides the right to exclude the same statute that grants that right also permits other parties including accused infringers to challenge the validity of a patent and to contest a charge of infringement
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 1988
moreover entitlement to an injunction implementing the right to exclude as compared with only assessing damages against an infringer is not absolute even during the life of a patent but is discretionary
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 283` courts having jurisdiction of cases under this title may grant injunctions' emphasis added ; see also city of milwaukee v. activated sludge inc. 69_f.2d_577 593 21_uspq2d_69 85-86 7th cir.1934 ; vitamin technologists inc. v. wisconsin alumni research found. inc. 146_f.2d_941 944-45 63_uspq_262 267 9th cir.1944
here because kearns patents have expired the district_court certainly did not abuse its discretion in denying injunctive_relief

it is unfortunate that kearns feels that he never enjoyed an exclusive status under his patents but that is simply a consequence of the right of others to challenge his patents and the fact that his patents have expired
the patent statute does provide for increased damages and attorney fees as additional relief for aggrieved patent_owners see 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 284 285 1988 but kearns did not persuade the district_court that he was entitled to such_relief

we therefore conclude that the district_court properly granted summary_judgment in favor of chrysler on kearns request for post-expiration injunctive_relief

lost profits
kearns argues that the district_court erred in granting chryslers motion for summary_judgment on kearns claim for damages based on lost profits rather than a reasonable_royalty
a patent_owner bears the burden of proof on damages
fromson v. western litho plate and supply co. 853_f.2d_1568 1574 7_uspq2d_1606 1612 fed.cir.1988
kearns has not carried that burden with respect to lost profits

a lost profits award is appropriate only if the patent_owner can prove there was a reasonable probability that` but for' the infringement it would have made the infringers sales
water technologies corp. v. calco ltd. 850_f.2d_660 671 7_uspq2d_1097 1106 fed.cir
) cert
denied 488_u.s._968 109_s.ct._498 102_l.ed.2d_534_(1988)
one way to establish` but for' causation is to meet the four-part test pronounced in panduit corp. v. stahlin bros. fibre works 575_f.2d_1152 1156 197_uspq_726 729-30 6th cir.1978
see standard havens prods. 953 f.2d at 1372-73 21 uspq2d at 1331
to recover under that test the patent_owner must prove 1 a demand for the patented_product 2 an absence of acceptable noninfringing substitutes 3 manufacturing and marketing capability to exploit the demand and 4 the amount of profit the patent_owner would have made
id
( emphasis added

in ruling against kearns the district_court concluded that kearns failed to prove the panduit requirements for lost profits particularly with regard to whether he possessed the capability to manufacture and market iwws
the court determined that` [ a ] t best plaintiffs offer of proof demonstrates plans for manufacture that were tentative speculative and contingent
plaintiff does not suggest he ever made any sales of intermittent_windshield_wipers or had the manufacturing capability in hand to do so'
kearns disputes the courts finding stating that his company` kearns engineers' had the capacity to manufacture market and sell iwws since the 1960s and that chryslers infringement prevented him from selling his iwws to chrysler
that contention however *1552 is not supported by the record.12 where as here a patent_owner fails to prove lost profits the court is left with no alternative but to have damages determined on the basis of a reasonable_royalty
see water technologies 850 f.2d at 673-74 7 uspq2d at 1108

accordingly we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment in favor of chrysler on the issue of lost profits

3
other rulings
we have carefully reviewed the district_courts other rulings respecting willful_infringement disqualification of counsel prejudgment_interest and attorneys fees and costs
the rulings are adequately supported by the record and are consistent with governing law
we need not address kearns contentions in detail
for purposes of our decision suffice it to say that kearns has not identified any reversible_error in law or fact made by the district_court in reaching its decisions
accordingly we affirm the district_courts rulings

conclusion
the district_court did not err in denying chryslers post-verdict motions
nor did the district_court commit any reversible_error in ruling on the various issues disputed by kearns
accordingly the district_courts judgment is affirmed in all respects

affirmed

the jury also found that chrysler infringed claim 7 of the178_patent
due to an inconsistency between the jurys general verdict of infringement and its answer to a special question the district_court set aside the jurys finding and entered judgment of noninfringement pursuant to fed.r.civ.p

the courts judgment respecting claim 7 is not at issue in this appeal

the court subsequently revised the number of infringing units downward to 12,563,107 units
4
specifically the judgment consisted of $ 11,306,696.30 for infringement damages $ 8,075,193 for prejudgment_interest and $ 25,898.75 for costs less $ 667,322.62 in costs expenses and attorneys fees awarded to chrysler

the district_court did not rely on the first stipulation of october 15 1982 in making its disputed evidentiary rulings
the court considered that stipulation to be functus officio in view of the february 15 1990 stipulation
we will therefore limit our discussion to the latter stipulation
6
the judge who presided over the ford litigation also presided over the chrysler litigation
in rejecting chryslers initial attempts to avoid its stipulation judge cohn stated` i know that i entered a partial judgment of validity after a hotly contested trial
to my way of thinking.. there was no consent judgment on validity
validity was contested
kearns won ford lost and it chose not to appeal and it withdrew its motions jnov or new_trial
that does n't obviate the fact that it was judgment contested arising in a contested environment'

the claims at issue contain limitations expressed in` means-plus-function' format
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?

the courts ruling is consistent with the rule that` [ i ] t is not necessary to consider the prior_art in applying section 112 paragraph 6
even if the prior_art discloses the same or an equivalent_structure the claim will not be limited in scope thereby'

the jury decided some 39 special_questions concerning the issue of infringement
five special_questions were directed to infringement of claim 5 of790_patent 17 special_questions to claim 16 of the836_patent and five special_questions to claim 6 of the374_patent
10
the836_patent expired in 1984 and the790 and374_patent s both expired in 1988
11
the fact that kearns has fired several of his attorneys and attempted to conduct massive multiple suits pro se may be relevant to his dilemma
12
we note that the appendices filed by kearns on appeal contain documents not considered by the district_court
we of course must limit our review to the record produced at trial
