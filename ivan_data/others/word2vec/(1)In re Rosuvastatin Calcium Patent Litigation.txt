newman circuit_judge
this patent litigation arises under the hatch-waxman_act 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 whereby producers of generic pharmaceutical products are authorized to challenge the patent status of a federally registered and approved drug_product before the generic_producer has obtained approval to sell its counterpart of the approved product
the generic litigant who succeeds in eliminating the drug patent is granted a 180-day period of exclusivity against other potential providers of the generic_product
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 5 b iv

the drug_product here at issue is the` statin' having the brand name crestorthe_r which is federally approved for use in control of cholesterol and for treatment of atherosclerosis
in suit is united_states reissue patent no._37314` the ¡¬314_patent` which is a reissue of *515 united_states patent no._5260,440` the ¡¬440_patent`
the patentee is shionogi_seiyaku_kabushiki_kaisha` shionogi' and the exclusive licensee is astrazeneca uk and its united_states subsidiary ipr pharmaceuticals inc. collectively` plaintiffs'

the active ingredient of crestorthe_r is the calcium salt of a chemical compound whose common name is rosuvastatin of the following structural formula

?
rosuvastatin is one of several statin products that lower cholesterol production in the liver by inhibiting the enzyme hmg-coa reductase
scientists working at the shionogi laboratory in japan were conducting research in search of a statin with reduced_side_effects as compared with the statin products that were then known
in the course of this research in 1991 they discovered rosuvastatin and its beneficial properties
patents were obtained in japan and other countries including the ¡¬314_patent in the united_states
federal approval for sale and use in the united_states was granted on august 12 2003 after over two decades of development
the product was highly successful due to its superior efficacy in lowering low-density ldl cholesterol and elevating high-density hdl cholesterol and its reduced_side_effects as compared with other commercial statins
see peter h. jones et al. comparison of the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin simvastatin and pravastatin across doses stellar trial 92 am

several generic_producers initiated a challenge to the ¡¬314_patent by filing an abbreviated_new_drug_application anda accompanied by a paragraph_iv_certification 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv
an anda permits a generic_producer to market a drug_product based on the federal approval obtained by the original registrant
submission of an anda constitutes a statutory_act of infringement pursuant to ¡± 271 e 2 of the patent_act which provides it shall be an act of infringement to submit an application under [ section 355 j of title 21 ].. for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent.. if the purpose of such_submission is to obtain approval under such act to engage in the commercial_manufacture use or sale of a drug veterinary biological product or biological product claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such_patent
35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a
if the challenge to the patent fails the anda can not be approved until expiration of the patent
35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 4 a

the infringement suits against the several generic challengers were consolidated in the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware
the defendants are aurobindo_pharma_ltd. mylan_pharmaceuticals_inc. apotex_corp. cobalt_pharmaceuticals_inc. and cobalt_laboratories_inc. sun_pharmaceutical_industries ltd. teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc. par pharmaceuticals inc. and sandoz inc
the defendants argued that the ¡¬ *516 314 patent is invalid on the ground of obviousness and improper_reissue and that the patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in the patent and trademark_office` pto'

the district_court ruled that the ¡¬314_patent is valid enforceable and infringed.1 the defendants all admitted infringement except for apotex_corp. all of the defendants appeal the rulings of validity and enforceability

i. validity
the defendants challenge patent validity on the ground of obviousness
obviousness is decided as a matter of law based on four basic factual inquiries as set forth in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) and elaborated in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 406-07 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) viz. 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention 3 the differences between the claimed subject_matter and the prior_art and 4 any objective_indicia of unobviousness such as commercial_success or long-felt need or failure of others

the defendants identified as the closest prior_art european patent office publication no._0_367_895 of the sandoz company` sandoz` published may_16,_1990 which describes numerous pyrimidine-based statin_compounds including a compound designated as compound 1b
compound 1b has two -ch3 methyl groups on the amino side chain instead of one -ch3 and one -so2ch3 group as in rosuvastatin
compound 1b has the following structural formula

?
the sandoz_european_application describes compound 1b as an` especially preferred embodiment of the invention'
sandoz at *9
the defendants argued in the district_court that this statement suggests that compound 1b would be a good` lead_compound' for further research and that with this selection as lead_compound the change of the -ch3 group to a -so2ch3 group would have been obvious because it would make compound 1b more hydrophilic
the defendants stated that *517 numerous publications taught that liver-selective statins may have fewer undesirable side effects and that hydrophilic statins are more liver-selective
the defendants argued that persons of ordinary_skill in this field would have been motivated to make sandoz_compound 1b more hydrophilic and that the c2_position as marked on the molecule supra was the logical place to modify compound 1b because the other_parts of the structure were known to be essential to statin_activity
the defendants argued that a person of ordinary_skill would have considered a limited number of common substitutions including a sulfonyl` spacer' -so2-at the c2_position to increase hydrophilicity
the defendants argued that a person of ordinary_skill would have predicted that this change would produce a statin with fewer adverse side effects thereby rendering the compound obvious
in response the plaintiffs pointed out that sandoz_compound 1b demonstrated unexpected increased toxicity and therefore was not an encouraging lead_compound
the plaintiffs stated that other compounds in the sandoz_european_application such as compound 11 demonstrated better in vitro potency
the plaintiffs responded to the argument that in 1991 a scientist would have known that compound 1b should be made more hydrophilic by pointing to publications that state that lipophilic_substituents at the c2_position the converse of hydrophilic can increase statin potency
the plaintiffs argued that the prior_art provided no suggestion of rosuvastatins unexpectedly superior properties as compared with compound 1b or any other known compound thus creating no` reasonable_expectation of success'
pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1361 fed.cir.2007` [ t ] he burden falls on the challenger of the patent to show by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art_references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so
``

the plaintiffs highlighted the unpredictability that was associated with statin development
for example the pyrrole-based statin corresponding in all other structural aspects to the pyrimidine-based rosuvastatin displayed toxic side effects
the plaintiffs pointed out that at least five pharmaceutical companies had abandoned their research on statins with pyrimidine cores on the prevailing belief that pyrimidine-based statins were not promising leads to improved products
the plaintiffs pointed out that no reference or combination of references suggested that the previously unknown molecule rosuvastatin would have its advantageous properties
see ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727` a factfinder should be aware.. of the distortion caused by hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning
`` ; yamanouchi pharm co. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 231_f.3d_1339 1345 fed.cir.2000 finding that` an ordinary medicinal chemist' would not have expected the specific chemical structure to have the` most desirable combination of pharmacological properties' internal quotation omitted
the plaintiffs pointed to objective_indicia of non-obviousness including commercial_success long felt but unfilled need failure of others and unexpected results graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684 as support for the district_courts judgment of unobviousness

the district_court applied the correct standard that the challenger must demonstrate by clear and convincing_evidence that the invention would have been *518 obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention at the time the invention was made
pfizer 480 f.3d at 1359-60` since we must presume a patent valid the patent challenger bears the burden of proving the factual elements of invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
that burden of proof never shifts to the patentee to prove validity`
the district_court discussed the defendants argument that the insertion of a sulfonyl group at position c2 was one of a` finite number of identified predicable solutions' to existing problems with statins in the words of ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727 and thus that it would have been obvious to make this specific compound and test its properties
the district_court found that this situation was similar to that discussed in in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894_(fed.cir.1988) where the court explained that obviousness is not shown when` what wasobvious to try was to explore a new technology or general approach that seemed to be a promising field of experimentation where the prior_art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it'
id.at 903
the district_court concluded that the defendants did not demonstrate the required motivation for selecting sandoz_compound 1b as a lead_compound or for making this specific sulfonyl change in the compound 1b molecule
see eli_lilly & co. v. zenith goldline pharms. 471_f.3d_1369 1379 fed.cir.2006 considering whether a prior_art compound would have been chosen as a lead_compound

we agree that` obvious to try' was negated by the general skepticism concerning pyrimidine-based statins the fact that other pharmaceutical companies had abandoned this general structure and the evidence that the prior_art taught a preference not for hydrophilic substituents but for lipophilic_substituents at the c2_position
see takeda chem indus. ltd. v. alphapharm pty. 492_f.3d_1350 1357 fed.cir.2007` [ i ] n cases involving new chemical compounds it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness of a new claimed compound
``

the district_court correctly held that patent invalidity on the ground of obviousness had not been shown for the compound_rosuvastatin
that ruling is affirmed

ii
inequitable conduct
the defendants also argued that the ¡¬314_patent is permanently unenforceable because of inequitable_conduct during prosecution of the ¡¬440_patent from which the ¡¬314_patent was reissued
the defendants attributed the inequitable_conduct to two employees in shionogis in-house patent staff in japan ms. tomoko kitamura and mr. takashi shibata who did not disclose three documents to the pto during prosecution of the ¡¬440_patent
the documents were bayer japanese patent application no
hi-261377 filed feb._2,_1989 published aug._31,_1989 the sandoz published european_application describing compound 1b and a european patent office search report that included the sandoz_application
the defendants state that all three documents were highly material to patentability that they were intentionally withheld during prosecution of the ¡¬440_patent and that such_inequitable_conduct can not be cured by a reissue action wherein shionogi disclosed these patent documents
the plaintiffs respond that there was no intent to deceive or mislead the pto and that any error in prosecution of the ¡¬440_patent was unintentional and was rectified by prompt_filing of the reissue_application and disclosure of the uncited *519 references as soon as shionogi discovered the error

to prove inequitable_conduct the challenger must show by clear and convincing_evidence that the patent applicant 1 misrepresented or omitted information material to patentability and 2 did so with specific_intent to mislead or deceive the pto
therasense inc. v. becton dickinson and co. 649_f.3d_1276 1287 fed.cir.2011 en banc
materiality and intent must be separately established
id.at 1290
to establish materiality it must be shown that the pto would not have allowed the claim but for the nondisclosure or misrepresentation
id.at 1291
to establish intent intent to deceive the pto must be`the single most reasonable_inference able to be drawn from the evidence
`` id.at 1290 quoting star_scientific inc. v. r.j. reynolds tobacco co. 537_f.3d_1357 1366 fed.cir.2008
the district_courts findings on materiality and intent are reviewed for clear_error and the courts ultimate decision as to inequitable_conduct is reviewed on the standard of abuse of discretion
am calcar inc. v. am
honda motor co. inc. 651_f.3d_1318 1334 fed.cir.2011

there was extensive evidence and argument before the district_court including the live_testimony of the shionogi personnel who were accused of acting inequitably
it was explained that when scientists at shionogi obtained favorable results with certain modified pyrimidine_compounds including rosuvastatin the shionogi_patent_department was asked to file a patent_application on their results
ms._kitamura then a shionogi_employee obtained search reports relating to these products
the reports identified the sandoz_european_application that included compound 1b and the bayer japanese application that described a large class of statin_compounds that generically included the rosuvastatin class of substituents but not showing the specific compounds that shionogi submitted for patenting
ms._kitamura testified that because` [ t ] here were no instances of the same compounds as shionogi' she did not believe that the references created a patentability_problem
j.a
21458-60
ms._kitamura prepared and filed the japanese patent_application and processed the foreign counterparts including the united_states ¡¬440_application

the ¡¬440_patent_application was filed in the united_states on june_12,_1992
the application described a class of compounds with a pyrimidine core as hmg-coa reductase inhibitors
table 4 of the application showed that rosuvastatin had the best hmg-coa reductase inhibitory activity
ms._kitamura left shionogi employment about six weeks after the ¡¬440_application was filed in the united_states and mr._shibata assumed responsibility for these applications
he received an epo_search_report which identified the sandoz_application as` particularly relevant if taken alone'
mr._shibata asked the shionogi_scientists to conduct tests to compare the shionogi compounds with the preferred_compounds described in the sandoz and bayer_applications

no information_disclosure_statement` ids' was filed for the ¡¬440_application and neither the sandoz_application nor the bayer_application was provided to the pto or cited by the examiner of the ¡¬440_application
the ¡¬ 440 patent was issued in the united_states on november 9 1993

in the fall of 1997 astrazeneca and shionogi began negotiating a license to rosuvastatin
during the negotiation it was discovered that no ids had been filed during prosecution of the ¡¬440_application and that the sandoz and bayer_applications had not been cited by the examiner
u.s. patent counsel was consulted and on november 4 1997 shionogi filed an application *520 to reissue the ¡¬440_patent in order to file an ids and to include the sandoz and bayer_references in the examination
shionogi certified to the pto that it had erroneously not brought these references to the examiners attention and that it was through error and not due to deceptive_intent
the reissue_examiner then rejected the generic ¡¬440 claims as obvious in view of the bayer_reference
in response shionogi limited the ¡¬440_patent to the specific compound_rosuvastatin and its salts
the reissue was granted and the application issued as the ¡¬314 reissue_patent on august 7 2001

the defendants argued that the sandoz and bayer_references were material and that they were deliberately withheld with deceptive_intent and that such_inequitable_conduct could not be cured

1
materiality
in the district_court the defendants argued that the bayer and sandoz_applications and epo_search_report are all highly material to patentability
the defendants pointed to the reissue_examiners rejection of the claims as initially granted and shionogis retrenchment in claim scope
the defendants argued that shionogis prompt_filing of the reissue_application itself demonstrated that shionogi recognized the materiality of these references

although we doubt that the act of taking prompt remedial action is appropriately viewed as an admission of wrongdoing the district_court found the sandoz and bayer_references to be material to the prosecution of the ¡¬440_application
we agree that the reference_compounds are sufficiently similar in structure to warrant citation
although the references were held by the pto not to negate patentability of rosuvastatin as affirmed ante we do not disturb the district_courts finding of materiality

2
intent
the district_court found that the defendants did not establish that either ms._kitamura or mr._shibata withheld the sandoz and bayer_references with deceptive_intent
although deceptive_intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence the inference` must not only be based on sufficient evidence and be reasonable in light of that evidence but it must also be the single most reasonable_inference able to be drawn from the evidence to meet the clear and convincing_standard'
star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1366 ; see also therasense 649 f.3d at 1290

the defendants argued that intent to deceive should be inferred from three situations
first the defendants point to ms._kitamuras possession of the bayer_reference at the time she filed the ¡¬440_patent_application and her testimony in the district_court that she knew she had a duty to disclose the bayer_reference to the pto
second the defendants point to an internal shionogi memorandum stating that` [ d ] evelopment information on s-4522 [ rosuvastatin ] must not be leaked to the outside because it is included in the text of the published unexamined bayer patent_application..' j.a
2406
third the defendants state that mr._shibata knew about the bayer and sandoz_references and the epo_search_report yet failed to disclose them to the united_states examiner
defendants state that this failure to disclose was due to deceptive_intent as evidenced by mr._shibatas delays in processing the patent_applications

the district_court received testimony concerning the prosecution of the ¡¬440_application from mr._shibata ms._kitamura and mr._tamaki a third shionogi_employee
ms._kitamura testified that the ids for the ¡¬440_application was not due when she left employment at shionogi
mr._shibata *521 testified that he believed that it had been filed
mr._tamaki testified about the departments heavy work load and provided explanation of confusion and error
there was examination and cross-examination concerning the events at shionogi
the district_court found that` actions suggestive of malfeasance become no more than a string of mishaps mistakes misapprehensions and misjudgments on the part of inexperienced and overworked individuals'
op
528
the district_court stated that it` is simply not persuaded that the single most reasonable_inference to be drawn from these circumstances is deceptive_intent'
id.at 525

the defendants argue that the district_court clearly erred when it did not find an inference of deceptive_intent
the defendants stress that ms._kitamura did not remember details after twenty years and they also stress her admission that she knew she had a duty to disclose the bayer_reference
the plaintiffs reply that there was no evidence that she intended to withhold the reference in order to deceive the pto and that deceptive_intent is not` the single most reasonable_inference to be drawn from the evidence'
see therasense 649 f.3d at 1290
the plaintiffs point out that ms._kitamura left shionogi a month after filing the ¡¬440_application well before an ids was due to be filed

the district_court heard the testimony considered the credibility of the witnesses and concluded that deceptive_intent was not the single most reasonable_inference to be drawn from the evidence
`` this court may not reassess and indeed is incapable of reassessing witness credibility and motive issues on review'
lnp eng g plastics inc. v. miller waste mills inc. 275_f.3d_1347 1361 fed.cir.2001
the defendants have not shown clear_error in the district_courts finding that it was most likely that ms._kitamura acted without deceptive_intent

the defendants also argued that the district_court clearly erred in failing to find that mr._shibata possessed deceptive_intent
the defendants argued that mr._shibatas denials of deceptive_intent his apology and excuses should not have been credited by the district_court
the defendants argued that his admission of negligence does not avoid the inference of intent to deceive and stress that he had ordered comparative testing
the plaintiffs cited a report by mr._shibata dated july_14,_1993 which states in the record translationnovelty andinventive_step are examined to determine patentability
it seems that the examination in the u.s. was fairly lenient regardinginventive_step
since we expect a slightly stricter examination in europe and japan we are in the process of implementingcomparative tests in the laboratory that we can use as countermeasures
if the superiority of s-4522 [ rosuvastatin ] is confirmed in these tests a patent can be obtained in all countries in which we have filed
j.a
2752
the plaintiffs argued that this report is not consistent with an inference of deceptive_intent but instead reflects his belief that the examination in the united_states had been more` lenient' than was expected in europe and japan
the plaintiffs argued that by requesting comparative tests mr._shibata was preparing to confront the prior_art not to conceal it

the record and argument are extensive
clear error has not been shown in the district_courts finding that deceptive_intent was not shown and was not the single most reasonable_inference based on all of the evidence
see kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 873 fed.cir.1988 en banc in relevant *522 part the evidence` must be sufficient to require a finding of deceitful intent in light of all the circumstances`
the district_court observed the witnesses under examination and cross-examination examined the documents and reasonably found that it was` equally plausible' that mr._shibata believed the requirements of the united_states patent prosecution had been met
the district_court found that the evidence as a whole` paints a more innocent explanation of mr._shibata as a new and inexperienced manager attempting to handle an understaffed and overworked patent department'
op
525-26

we agree that clear and convincing_evidence did not show that ms._kitamura and mr._shibata made a deliberate_decision to withhold references from the pto
see therasense 649 f.3d at 1290` in a case involving nondisclosure of information clear and convincing_evidence must show that the applicant made a deliberate_decision to withhold a known material reference'
( quoting molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1181 fed.cir.1995
the court in therasense sought to impart objectivity to the law of inequitable_conduct by requiring that` the accused infringer must prove that the patentee acted with the specific_intent to deceive the pto' 649 f.3d at 1290
recognizing the complexity of patent prosecution negligence-even gross_negligence-is insufficient to establish deceptive_intent
see kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876` a finding that particular conduct amounts togross_negligence does not of itself justify an inference of intent to deceive' ; lazare kaplan int l inc. v. photoscribe techs. inc. 628_f.3d_1359 1379 fed.cir.2010` mistake or exercise of poor judgment.. does not support an inference of intent to deceive' ; molins 48 f.3d at 1181` [ t ] he alleged conduct must not amount merely to the improper performance of or omission of an act one ought to have performed
``

we affirm that unenforceability based on inequitable_conduct was not established

iii
reissue
the defendants also argued that the ¡¬314_patent was improperly reissued arguing that the statutory reissue requirement of error without deceptive_intent had not been met
the statute at the time of the reissue authorized the reissue of` inoperative or invalid' patents as follows whenever any patent is through error without any deceptive_intention deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective_specification or drawing or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim in the patent the director shall on the surrender of such_patent and the payment of the fee required by law reissue the patent for the invention disclosed in the original_patent.. 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 19992 the defendants argued that 1 there was no error and 2 there was deceptive_intent

the defendants argued that shionogi deliberately presented a claim in the ¡¬ 440 patent that overlapped the products in the sandoz_reference in an attempt to get greater protection
the defendants also argued that shionogi acted deliberately in obtaining only generic claims in the ¡¬440_patent in order to conceal the rosuvastatin_species
the plaintiffs pointed out that rosuvastatin was specifically described in *523 the specification as the most effective of the four compounds that are described with test data

the defendants also argued that deliberate prosecution decisions can never be corrected through reissue citing the statement in in re serenkin 479_f.3d_1359 1362 fed.cir.2007 that` case law holds that the deliberate_action of an inventor or attorney during prosecution generally fails to qualify as a correctable_error under ¡± 251'
however the court in serenkin did not hold that attorney action during prosecution is not correctable for a principal purpose of the reissue_statute is to permit correction of erroneous action during prosecution
rather the court held that it is appropriate to consider the nature of the action to determine whether it is a correctable_error
the serenkin court explained that` the extent to which the reissue_statute prevents an applicant from obtaining claims that differ in form or substance from the cancelled claimsnecessarily depends upon the facts in each case and particularly on the reasons for the cancellation
`` id.at 1365 quoting in re willingham 282_f.2d_353 357 ccpa 1960

on the facts of serenkin that court held that the proposed` correction' did not comport with the purposes of the reissue_statute
in serenkin the attorney wished to add eight sheets of drawings to his pending patent cooperation treaty` pct' application which had a filing_date of january 28 1997
for that purpose he filed a petition with the united_states pto receiving office under the pct requesting that the world intellectual property organization` republish this application showing a filing_date of 17_february_1998 with no priority claim and the eight sheets of drawings filed on 17_february_1998'
id.at 1361
the attorney had accepted the ptos position that he must choose between keeping the earlier international filing_date without the drawings or accepting the later_date with the drawings
the attorney chose the later_date with the drawings and the petition was granted
after the united_states patent was issued serenkin sought through reissue to recover the original filing_date stating that its attorney erred in choosing the later_date
the pto refused and this court affirmed stating that serenkin was impermissibly` attempting to use the reissue_process to undo the consequences of his attorneys conscious_decision to give up an earlier filing_date so that certain material which was considered important at the time would be considered with his pct application'
id.at 1365
the court stressed that the actions had been taken with knowledge of their consequences and compared these facts with those of in re wadlinger 496_f.2d_1200 1207 ccpa 1974 where the court explained that` error' for reissue_purposes encompasses` inadvertence accidents and mistakes' and` is certainly inclusive of actions taken in full consciousness'
in wadlinger the court determined that the reissue claims were narrower in scope than the original_claims and held that this was correctable_error under ¡± 251` despite the fact that the cancellation of the original_claims was deliberate' as explained in serenkin 479 f.3d at 1365

precedent establishes that for reissue_purposes` error is established where there is no evidence that the appellant intentionally omitted or abandoned the claimed subject_matter'
ball_corp. v. united_states 729_f.2d_1429 1435-36 fed.cir.1984
here the district_court found as fact that shionogi erred by failing to file an ids citing the sandoz and bayer_references and by omitting a specific_claim to the preferred_species
however the court found no evidence of a deliberate *524 choice to omit or abandon the rosuvastatin_species which was described in the specification as the most effective product

the defendants argument that shionogi can not narrow the claims by reissue has been rejected in a variety of situations
see e.g. in re tanaka 640_f.3d_1246 1250 fed.cir.2011` this court also rejects the ptos assertion that the omission of a narrower claim from an original_patent does not constitute an error under 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 because the omission of a dependent claim does not render the patent inoperative
`` ; medtronic inc. v. guidant corp. 465_f.3d_1360 1375 fed.cir.2006` an attorneys failure to appreciate the full scope of the invention is one of the most common sources of defects in patents and is generally sufficient to justify reissuing a patent'
( citing in re wilder 736_f.2d_1516 1519 fed.cir.1984 ; in re handel 312_f.2d_943 946_n._2_(ccpa_1963)` adding dependent claims as a hedge against possible invalidity of original_claims is a proper reason for asking that a reissue be granted'
the district_courts affirmance of the ptos holding that shionogi had the right to a reissue in which it claimed only rosuvastatin and its salts is in accordance with law

our colleague in dissent cites other cases in which reissue was denied on other facts and circumstances
while these cases illustrate the factual nature of a determination of` intent' no precedent warrants a finding of deceptive_intent in the situation herein
in in re_youman 679_f.3d_1335_(fed.cir.2012) the court determined whether the patentee was attempting to` recapture' through reissue subject_matter that had been surrendered during prosecution
in in re harita 847_f.2d_801_(fed.cir.1988) the court held that reissue was available although due to gross_negligence the foreign patent practitioner did not assure that the pto was advised of prior_art that was discovered after the patent_application was filed ; the court held that` intent to mislead' could not be inferred even from gross_negligence
in hewlett-packard_co. v. bausch & lomb inc. 882_f.2d_1556 1566 fed.cir.1989 the court held that the patentees submission of false affidavits to the pto` eliminated the basis for reissue and rendered the ¡¬684_patent invalid' because the patentees explanation of` error' was` factually untrue'
in in re hounsfield 699_f.2d_1320 1323 fed.cir.1983 the court held that` lack ofintent to claim is not an independent basis for denying a reissue_application under section 251' but only` sheds light upon whether the claims of the reissue_application are directed to the same invention as the original_patent..' in in re whittelsey 83_f.2d_894_(ccpa_1936) the court held that the patentee could not use reissue to obtain claims which` were intentionally omitted from his original_application under the belief that they could not properly be included therein..' in in re murray 77_f.2d_651 654-55 ccpa 1935 the court held that the patentee could not use reissue to obtain broader claims to cover` improvements in the art which have occurred since the date of issuance of the original_patent' and were` not intended to be incorporated in the original_application'
none of these cases supports rejection of a reissue_application for an unintentional_failure to file an ids

the district_court considered the defendants arguments directed to both error and deceptive_intent and concluded that shionogi did not act intentionally to make the error for which it seeks reissue
the district_court received live_testimony from the purported culprits and found that` the evidence adduced in this case shows no such deliberate choices [ as on the facts of serenkin ] and no violations of rules or statutes that would render the reissue of *525 the ¡¬440_patent improper'
op
534
in discussing the scope of the claims the district_court found that ms._kitamura credibly testified that she was unaware that there was overlap between the claims of the ¡¬440_application and the prior_art because` the internal shionogi search report of which she was aware did not raise a patentability_problem with respect to sandoz and a full copy of the sandoz_reference was not sent to her'
op
526
these internal_search_reports do not show the chemical structures of the sandoz_reference
j.a
2211 2224 2242
the district_court found that the evidence showed that after ms._kitamuras departure shionogi was not alerted to the need for further attention to the sandoz_reference because of` chaos confusion and inexperience'` lack of legal training within the shionogi patent department the changing and limited personnel within that department.. the ongoing confusion level' and` unintentional miscommunications' between shionogis patent personnel
id
these findings have not been shown to be clearly erroneous
and the defendants charge that shionogi deliberately obtained claims in the ¡¬440_patent that it knew to be invalid is not plausible

the district_court found that` the court is ultimately not convinced that the claims of the ¡¬440_patent that overlapped the sandoz_reference were the result of some planned strategy or sinister motivation as opposed to mere mistake or oversight by overworked individuals with limited training and expertise'

v. sandoz inc. 566_f.3d_1282_(fed.cir.2009)
the shionogi error in failing to file an ids was agreed to be an error and was rectified promptly upon its discovery
our colleague in dissent does not complain about the speed of the moves to correct the error but would hold that the error should have been detected sooner and that this failure of detection is fatal to the reissue_patent
however all of the cited cases relate to the absence of diligence in correcting the error after it was detected
e.g. principle_bus enters. inc. v. united_states 7_cl.ct._433 438 cl.ct.1985` the delay of more than seven years after plaintiffs learned of the alleged_error affecting their original_patent is unreasonably long and not justified

in contrast the reissue_application here was filed promptly upon discovery of the error

the defendants and our colleague in dissent propose that shionogi omitted a claim specific to rosuvastatin from its application in order to conceal the compound from competitors
however rosuvastatin was explicitly described in the shionogi specification as the preferred_compound
it was specifically identified including its synthesis and test results
this is not compatible with concealment
our colleague states that` [ d ] escribing a compound in the examples contained in the specification however is unlikely to be thered_flag that narrowly claiming a compound would be particularly if that compound is the only one specifically claimed'
dissent at 535-big_token__36_n._4__big_token
however this is not a case where the preferred_product was` buried' in massive disclosure for rosuvastatin was specifically described as the most potent product
the specification also states that the four tested compounds are` superior to mevinolin' a statin known to be commercially successful and marketed by merck under the brand name mevacorthe_r
the patentees decision to limit the reissue to the compound that was described in the specification as the most potent of the compounds specifically described is not evidence that the most potent compound was deceptively concealed

the dissent points to internal shionogi documents that caution against` leaking' the discovery of rosuvastatin to bayer
such caution was indeed prudent but when the discovery was presented for patenting it was specifically identified as the most effective compound
cautioning scientists against` leaks' is a distinct matter from the concern for obtaining valid and strong patents for specific_claims are more reliable than broad_claims that risk the citation of fringe prior_art
the dissent also argues that the fact that shionogi narrowed its reissue claims to the compound_rosuvastatin without seeking broader generic scope is evidence of deceptive_intent
shionogi states that its concern was to obtain examination on the uncited_references and that limiting the claims to the preferred_product implemented that concern
in view of the circumstances necessitating the reissue procedure in order to bring the uncited_references before the examiner it is not clear how the limitation of the claims to the compound of commercial interest suggests that the prior flawed procedures were based on deceptive_intent

we also take note of the dissents concern that` [ b ] y failing to act promptly *527 to narrow its overbroad_claim shionogi deprived the public of the right to experiment with and to improve upon the compounds encompassed by claim 1'

in sum the district_court correctly found that reissue was available and that the scope of the reissue was in accordance with law

iv
infringement
with the exception of apotex_corp. herein` apotex_u.s.' all of the defendants admit infringement of claims 6_and_8 of the ¡¬314_patent
apotex_u.s. is a united_states affiliate of the canadian company apotex inc. herein` apotex_canada'
apotex_u.s. stated in the district_court that it is a defendant to this action only because it signed and filed the anda on behalf of apotex_canada
apotex_u.s. stated that it did not` submit' the anda within the meaning of ¡± 271 e 2 a and thus can not infringe the u.s. patent
apotex_u.s. also stated that apotex_canada can not be liable for infringement in this action because it is not a party to this suit

the district_court found apotex_u.s. to be the anda` submitter' because apotex_u.s. filed the anda and actively participated with apotex_canada in preparation of the anda and that apotex_u.s. intends to directly benefit from the anda by selling the drug_product in the united_states upon approval of the anda
the court found that apotex_u.s. acts as the marketing and distribution arm of apotex_canada in the united_states a relationship that was not disputed
apotex_canada is not a party to this suit only because the infringement case against apotex_canada was transferred to the southern district of florida at the request of apotex_canada which pled the absence of personal jurisdiction in delaware
in re rosuvastatin_calcium_patent_litigation mdl no._08-1949 2010_wl_661599_(d.del._feb._19,_2010)

apotex_u.s. argues that it can not be bound by the district_courts judgment of infringement because it only signed and filed the anda as the agent of apotex_canada
the district_court ruled that apotex_u.s. can be liable for infringement under ¡± 271 e 2 a not only because apotex_u.s. is the entity that signed and filed the anda but also because it intends to benefit from the application by selling the rosuvastatin product manufactured by its canadian relative
the district_court referred to testimony by the president of apotex_u.s. who stated that apotex_canada` made the decision todevelop rosuvastatin calcium as a generic *528 product for the united_states for apotex_u.s. to sell in the united_states..` the district_court found that apotex_u.s. actively participated in activities related to the anda_submission in conjunction with apotex_canada and referred to activities of mr. kiran krishnan manager of regulatory affairs for apotex_u.s. at the headquarters of apotex_canada in preparing the anda in consultation with the regulatory staff of apotex_canada
mr. krishnan signed the anda on behalf of apotex_u.s. as the authorized u.s. agent
the district_court concluded that apotex_u.s. may be held liable for infringement under section 271 e 2 a as a` submitter' of an anda

responding to the apotex argument that the hatch-waxman_act does not provide a definition of` submit' the district_court adopted the legal_standard for a` submitter' set forth in in re rosuvastatin_calcium_patent_litig. 2008_wl_5046424 at *10 d.del

apotex br
15
apotex_u.s. argues that 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a incorporates ¡± 355 j and consequently defines who submits an anda
apotex_u.s. explains that the hatch-waxman_act similarly defines an applicant in its section related to new drug applications which states` [ t ] he applicant shall file with the application the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application..' 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 b 1 emphasis by apotex_u.s.
apotex_u.s. argues that ¡± 271 e 2 a makes no mention of` active involvement'` parent-subsidiary'` principal-agent' or intent to benefit from anda approval and argues that these factors are irrelevant to the` submitter' issue

apotex_u.s. argues that fda regulations identify the applicant as the person or entity who submits an anda citing 21 c.f.r.¡± 314.3 b` applicant means any person who submits an application or abbreviated application or an amendment or supplement to them under this part to obtain fda approval of a new drug or an antibiotic drug and any person who owns an approved application or abbreviated application`
apotex_u.s. states that apotex_canada made the paragraph_iv_certification that a paragraph_iv_certification is the infringing act under ¡± 271 e 2 and *529 therefore that apotex_u.s. can not be bound by any judgment of patent_infringement

apotex_u.s. also argues that the district_courts ruling is unfair because its orders can affect the interests of apotex_canada who is not before the delaware court and thus that the district_court violated the due process rights of apotex_canada
apotex_u.s. also argues that apotex_canada is a necessary party to the suit against apotex u.s

the district_court properly deemed these arguments unpersuasive
the court found that the interests of apotex_canada in this action are represented by its agent and subsidiary apotex_u.s. and that apotex_u.s. participated in preparation of the anda and represented that it would sell the product in the united_states
that relationship is not denied

we conclude that the district_court did not err in holding that apotex_u.s. is properly named as a defendant in this action
the judgment of infringement against all of the defendants is affirmed

affirmed

plager circuit_judge concurring
i join the opinion of judge newman

i write to clarify my understanding of why apotex_u.s. should be treated as having` submit [ ted ]' an application for an anda and therefore be held liable as an infringer under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2
the question is whether under the statute apotex_u.s.` submit [ ted ] an application.. for a drug.. claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such_patent'
if so the statute deems that to be an act of infringement
id

apotex_u.s. argues that in filing the application for the anda it was simply an agent for the true applicant apotex_canada
as an agent for the applicant apotex_u.s. argues that it is not an applicant and therefore can not be deemed an infringer
the question of whether an agent-filer-submitter such as apotex_u.s. can be a party liable for infringement under ¡± 271 e 2 is a question of first impression in this court

the statute nowhere addresses the question of agency in the submission of an application under ¡± 271 e
however in creating the artificial act of infringement by the submission of an anda the statute does add the following qualifier related to the applicants purpose in making the submission` it shall be an act of infringement to submit an application.. if the purpose of such_submission is to obtain approval.. to engage in the commercial_manufacture use or sale of a drug.. claimed in a patent..' id
( emphasis added
the phrasing leaves unclear what the consequences are if the party who submits the application is not the same as the principal_party who will` engage in' the manufacture of the drug at issue

thus the question becomes whether the statute is intended to include within its scope 1 any agent who simply submits i.e. files an application for another who is the principal_commercial_manufacturer ; or 2 an agent who files on behalf of such another but who has a financial_interest beyond simply acting for the commercial_manufacturer and in this latter situation what qualifies as a sufficient financial_interest

with regard to the first there can be no doubt that many applications are in fact submitted to the fda by attorneys or others acting as agents for the real_party in interest i.e. the commercial_manufacturer of the generic_drug at issue
it would make little sense to read the statute as making such agents liable for the artificial *530` act of infringement' created therein
though presumably an attorney or other agent representing a principal_commercial_manufacturer could fashion some sort of hold-harmless provision in the employment contract such unnecessary complication and the potential mischief associated therewith can not be what congress had in mind
an agent who simply prepares and submits the application as such is not an applicant ; it is the real_party in interest-the commercial_manufacturer-who is the statutory applicant who` submit [ s ]' the application and commits the act of infringement
in the case before us there is no doubt that apotex_canada is the principal_party in interest and intends` to engage in the commercial_manufacture use or sale' of the drug and thus is an applicant under the statute

but there remains the second inquiry
what of the agent who has a financial_interest in the manufacture or distribution of the drug that is the subject of the anda ?
here apotex_u.s. did indeed assist apotex_canada in the planning preparation and submission of the application but as discussed above that alone can not create liability
in this case however there is more-it is clear from the record that apotex_u.s. is not merely an agent who assisted the manufacturer in submitting an application under the statute

the record indicates that apotex_u.s. by virtue of the relationships between itself and apotex_canada both corporate and otherwise will become the entity-indeed a real_party in interest-that will use and sell the drug in the united_states
the trial court found based on the testimony of the president of apotex_u.s. that apotex_u.s. is the marketing arm of apotex_canada and that apotex_canada made the decision` to develop [ the drug ] as a generic_product for the united_states for apotex_u.s. to sell in the united_states..' see op.at 527-28
furthermore in its brief to this court apotex_u.s. acknowledged this relationship` apotex [ u.s. ] hopes to market the product described in the anda some day.. [ and ] desire [ s ] to one day market the product described in the anda..' appellants reply br.at 12

the district_court applied the following legal_standard for determining liability for submission of an anda a wholly-owned subsidiary of a foreign_anda_applicant which signs an anda as the agent of its parent-applicant and which intends to benefit directly if the anda is approved-by participating in the manufacture importation distribution and/or sale of the generic_drug- [ is ] subject to suit under ¡± 271 e as one who has` submitted' an anda
op.at 528 modification in original
this was a standard derived from the approach several other district_courts had taken

there is some logic to the position that when such a related agent expects to financially benefit from the approval of the anda in a significant way for example by becoming a major if not sole distributor of the generic_product in the united_states the statute can be understood broadly enough to include such an agent as a statutory` submit [ ter ]'
such an agent could thus be considered a party who may be held liable for the statutory_act of infringement by virtue of submission of the application.1

*531 although apotex_u.s. is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of apotex_canada they are closely related through a complex corporate structure.2 both the statutory analysis suggested here and the evidentiary record in this case support the district_court in bringing apotex_u.s. within the ambit of the party who submits an anda and thus is subject to liability as a deemed infringer

more directly however in this case apotex_u.s. clearly intends to engage in and presumably submitted the anda for the purpose of selling the approved drug in the united_states
the statute speaks not only in terms of engaging in commercial_manufacture but disjunctively in terms of engaging in the drugs` use or sale'
as an acknowledged sales agent for the primary applicant apotex_u.s. can be treated as simply having` submit [ ted ]' an application for an anda for the purpose of` engag [ ing ] in the commercial.. sale of [ the ] drug.. claimed in a patent'
under either analysis the district_court did not err in concluding that apotex_u.s. is liable for an act of infringement.3

there is no evidence that the overlap between claim 1 of the ¡¬440_patent and sandoz was the result of ignorance or inadvertence rather than a deliberate attempt to obtain patent rights that were as broad in scope as possible
not a single inventor or patent prosecutor testified that he or she unknowingly or inadvertently introduced the overlap between sandoz and claim 1
indeed the only inventor to testify at trial haruo koike stated that he did not believe that there was any error in the ¡¬ 440 patent
joint_app
22763-65

it is undisputed that shionogi was aware of sandoz when it prosecuted and obtained the broad_claims of the ¡¬440_patent
a june 1991 shionogi internal_search_report identified sandoz as relevant_prior_art
in october 1992 shionogi received a european patent office` epo' search report with an attached copy of sandoz
this report identified sandoz as an` x' reference meaning that the reference was` particularly relevant if taken alone'
shionogi received the epo_search_report a second time when the european_counterpart to the ¡¬440_patent was published in january 1993

tomoko kitamura the shionogi_employee who filed the ¡¬440_application testified at trial but never stated that she misapprehended the sandoz_disclosure or that she failed to appreciate the overlap between it and claim 1 of the ¡¬440_patent
to the contrary the record shows that shionogi was well aware of sandoz at the time kitamura filed the ¡¬440_application
a november 1991 internal_search_report listed sandoz as relevant_prior_art and explained that it disclosed a` pyrimidine skeleton' with statin_activity
given the obvious_overlap between sandoz and claim 1 it defies credulity to accept that kitamura who had had several years of experience preparing and prosecuting patent_applications and who holds a degree in organic chemical synthesis would fail to appreciate that claim 1 was directed to subject_matter previously disclosed in sandoz.2

*533 when kitamura left shionogi in july 1992 takashi shibata assumed primary responsibility for prosecution of the ¡¬440_application
shibata received the epo_search_report declaring sandoz to be` particularly relevant' stand-alone_prior_art
shibata moreover specifically instructed shionogi_scientists to test and compare the preferred_compounds disclosed in sandoz with those disclosed in the ¡¬440_application
although shibata testified at trial he like kitamura never stated that he failed to appreciate the scope of the invention disclosed in the ¡¬440_patent or that he was unaware of the obvious_overlap between claim 1 and sandoz

in 1997 shionogi and zeneca limited` zeneca' 3 entered into discussions regarding a licensing agreement that would allow zeneca to commercialize rosuvastatin the most promising compound disclosed in the ¡¬ 440 patent
during these negotiations zeneca raised concerns that sandoz was potentially invalidating prior_art
joint_app
2285-86
in response shionogi conceded that it` had been aware of [ sandoz ].. prior to filing the [ ¡¬440_application ]' and that there was an overlap between claim 1 of the ¡¬ 440 patent and` the disclosure and claims of [ sandoz ]'
id.at 2290
shionogi asserted however that` not so much attention was paid' to sandoz because it believed that rosuvastatin` did not fall within the scope of [ sandoz ]'
id
significantly when responding to zenecas invalidity concerns shionogi did not assert that it had previously misunderstood the scope of the sandoz_disclosure or that it had unintentionally or inadvertently introduced the overlap between sandoz and claim 1

a patentee can not establish correctible` error' under section 251 simply by demonstrating that his original_patent contains a defect
hewlett-packard 882 f.2d at 1565 emphasizing that the fact that a patent is` defective' does not` give [ ] rise to an inference ofoversight` ; weiler 790 f.2d at 1582-83 concluding that reissue was not permitted where a patentee failed to establish that he had unintentionally omitted subject_matter from his original_claims ; in re mead 581_f.2d_251 257 c.c.p.a.1978 holding that a` conscious choice' not to file a continuing application did not constitute correctible_error ; in re byers 230_f.2d_451 454 c.c.p.a.1956 emphasizing that the deliberate amendment of a claim did not constitute correctible_error
instead reissue is warranted only where a patentee` supplies.. facts indicating how.. ignorance' accident or mistake caused an error in his claims [ the patentees ] reliance on allegations of the inventors ignorance of drafting and claiming technique and counsels ignorance of the invention is unavailing
those allegations could be frequently made and if accepted as establishing error would require the grant of reissues on anything and everything mentioned in a disclosure
[ the patentee ] supplies no facts indicating how the ignorance relied on caused any error.. [ section ] 251 does not authorize the patentee to re-present his application
weiler 790 f.2d at 1583_n._4_(emphasis_added) ; see also in re wittry 489_f.2d_1299 1302 c.c.p.a.1974 holding reissue claims invalid where` the declarations [ did ] not present any reasonable_explanation of *534 any errors in the original_claims which the reissue would overcome'

serenkin 479 f.3d at 1362-65 is instructive on this issue
there a prosecuting attorney chose to accept a later_filing_date in exchange for being allowed to include additional drawings with his application
the patentee later sought reissue arguing that his attorney had` made the wrong procedural choice' by accepting the later_filing_date
id.at 1362
we rejected this argument explaining that reissue is appropriate where there has been` a genuine error' but not where a patentee or his attorney has made` a deliberate but subsequently found to be disadvantageous choice'
id.at 1364

a similar analysis applies here
shionogi made an error in judgment when it prosecuted and maintained a broad_genus_claim that clearly overlapped with a known prior_art_reference
absent any evidence showing that this overlap was the result of inadvertence or mistake however shionogi had no right to invoke the reissue_process in order to remedy its` deliberate but subsequently found to be disadvantageous choice'
id
; hewlett-packard 882 f.2d at 1566 rejecting the argument that` an error in conduct must be presumed absent affirmative evidence that the defect in the patent which is asserted in the reissue_application was intentional' ; see also youman 679 f.3d at 1343 explaining that section 251s` error' requirement covers` inadvertence or mistake' not` deliberate' choices made by the patentee
as we have previously made clear section 251` was not enacted as a panacea for all patent prosecution problems nor as a grant to the patentee of a second opportunity to prosecute de novo his original_application'
weiler 790 f.2d at 1582

on appeal shionogi argues that the overlap with sandoz must have been unintentional because` no rational patent applicant would intentionally pursue claims known to be invalid'
this argument is unpersuasive for two reasons
first the fact that claim 1 overlapped with sandoz did not necessarily render that claim invalid
a subset of a broad genus of prior_art compounds is potentially patentable
see eli_lilly & co. v. bd
of regents 334_f.3d_1264 1270 fed.cir.2003
indeed during the negotiations with zeneca shionogis u.s. patent attorney stated that claim 1 of the ¡¬440_patent was not necessarily invalid in view of sandoz` because it [ could ] be said that ours is a selection invention from within the genus of [ sandoz ]'
joint_app
5187

second patentees not infrequently intentionally draft very broad independent claims but` hedge' against invalidity by drafting narrower dependent claims
see in re tanaka 640_f.3d_1246 1249-51 fed.cir.2011
here shionogi believed that even if the broad_genus_claim contained in claim 1 was subsequently found to be invalid subgenus claims 2_and_3 which did not overlap with sandoz would protect rosuvastatin its most important compound
see joint_app
20513-15 ; 8532-37 ; 20208-09

ii
in concluding that the ¡¬440_patent was properly reissued the majority conflates the issue of whether shionogi was guilty of inequitable_conduct with the question of whether it met the requirements for reissue under section 251
shionogi failed to cite any relevant_prior_art to the united_states patent and trademark_office` pto' when it prosecuted the ¡¬440_application
indeed the record suggests that shionogi acted with intent to deceive the pto when it failed to disclose the highly material bayer_application see japanese published patent application no._1989-261377 and the epo_search_report identifying *535 sandoz as a highly relevant stand-alone prior_art_reference
prior to therasense inc. v. becton dickinson & co. 649_f.3d_1276 1290-93 fed.cir.2011 en banc this conduct would surely have been censored as fraud on the patent office
even accepting arguendo that shionogis malfeasance was insufficient to satisfy the standard for inequitable_conduct articulated in therasense however this does not mean that the ¡¬ 440 patent was validly reissued
whether shionogi intended to deceive the pto by failing to disclose sandoz is a wholly separate issue from whether it deliberately introduced an overlap between sandoz and the ¡¬440_patent

shionogi asserts that it failed to disclose material_prior_art to the pto because of the` chaos' and` confusion' that ensued after kitamura resigned in july 1992
astrazeneca pharms
lp v. mylan pharms inc. 719_f.supp.2d_388 400 d.del.2010
kitamura however had already filed the ¡¬440_application-with its overlap with sandoz-when she left shionogi
there is no evidence that there was any confusion or chaos in the shionogi_patent_department before kitamuras departure
thus while confusion within the shionogi_patent_department may have led to the failure to disclose material_prior_art there is no evidence that it led to the overlap between sandoz and claim 1

iii
when shionogi submitted its reissue_application it filed a declaration stating that it had` claimed more than [ it ] had a right to claim by reason of the disclosure of [ sandoz ]'
joint_app
2812
shionogi could have remedied the overlap with sandoz by simply revising claim 1
instead however shionogi ultimately cancelled all of the claims of the ¡¬440_patent -including claims 2_and_3 which did not overlap with sandoz-and replaced them with new claims narrowly directed to rosuvastatin
if the overlap with sandoz were the result of inadvertence or mistake and shionogi was merely attempting to rectify this alleged_error it presumably would have simply revised claim 1 and left claims 2_and_3 intact

shionogis initial failure to obtain a narrow_claim directed to rosuvastatin was not the result of error or mistake but was instead part of a deliberate effort to avoid alerting bayer its competitor of its interest in the compound
shionogi was very concerned that if bayer discovered that shionogi was focusing on rosuvastatin it would try to include that compound in the claims of its pending patent_application
in a november 1991 memorandum for example shionogi advised its employees to be` on maximum alert' to prevent` leaks of secrets relating to the status of the shionogi [ rosuvastatin ] development' because` bayer might make an effort to assert' that rosuvastatin was included within the claims of its pending application
joint_app
2241
indeed at trial shibata acknowledged that shionogi was concerned` that if bayer found out that shionogi was focusing on [ rosuvastatin ] bayer would try to cover [ rosuvastatin ] in their pending..
application'
joint_app
20760

there is no evidence that the failure to include a claim directed to rosuvastatin was the result of` error' or mistake
instead the record contains strong evidence that shionogi failed to specifically claim rosuvastatin in order to avoid` tipping off' bayer about its interest in the compound.4 *536 it was only after the bayer_application had been withdrawn that shionogi decided to add narrow_claims directed to rosuvastatin and its salts

contrary to the majoritys assertions ante at 523-24 the situation presented here is far different from that presented in tanaka
there we concluded that reissue was proper where a patentee retained his original_claims but added a narrow dependent claim
640 f.3d at 1249-51
in tanaka however the inventor supported his claim of error by filing a declaration explaining that he` did not fully appreciate the process of claiming according to u.s. practice..' id.at 1247
here by contrast there is no evidence that the overlap with sandoz was due to any misunderstanding of pto requirements or procedures
shionogi had extensive experience prosecuting u.s._patents
indeed before november 1993 when the ¡¬ 440 patent issued shionogi had applied for and received more than 200 u.s._patents
significantly at approximately the same time that kitamura filed the application for the pyrimidine_compounds disclosed in the ¡¬440_patent she also filed an application directed to pyrrole statin_compounds
this pyrrole application contained a narrow_claim directed to the preferred pyrrole compound
kitamura therefore clearly understood how to draft a claim specifically directed to a preferred_compound and yet failed to do so when she filed the ¡¬440_application

`` reissue is an extraordinary procedure and must be adequately supported by the circumstances detailed in [ section 251 ]'
ball_corp. v. united_states 729_f.2d_1429 1435 fed.cir.1984 footnote omitted ; see also hewlett-packard 882 f.2d at 1566 concluding that reissue was not permitted where a patentee failed to provide an adequate` explanation of what his error was and how and why it occurred' emphasis omitted
thus a reissue_patent is invalid where as here a patentee fails to substantiate assertions of` error' in the original_claims
see hewlett-packard 882 f.2d at 1565` [ a ] reissue applicant does not make a prima facie case of error in conduct merely by submitting a sworn statement which parrots the statutory language
`` ; wittry 489 f.2d at 1302 concluding that reissue was improper where` the declarations [ did ] not present any reasonable_explanation of any errors in the original_claims which the reissue would overcome'
here shionogi obtained claims which obviously overlapped with a known prior_art_reference and intentionally failed to seek a claim directed to its preferred_compound in order to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace
such machinations constitute an abuse of the reissue_process and are wholly contrary to the objectives of section 251 a statute predicated` on fundamental principles of equity and fairness' weiler 790 f.2d at 1579 ; see also serenkin 479 f.3d at 1362 emphasizing that` the remedial function of the [ reissue ] statute is not without limits' and` the deliberate_action of an inventor or attorney during prosecution generally fails to qualify as a correctable_error under ¡± 251' ; in re harita 847_f.2d_801 809 fed.cir.1988` in any given case the [ reissue ] statute should be so applied to the facts that justice will be done both to the patentee and the public
``

the claims of a validly-issued patent serve an important notice function alerting the public of the metes and bounds of an inventors discovery
see *537 superior fireplace co. v. majestic prods co. 270_f.3d_1358 1371 fed.cir.2001` this court has previously noted the propriety of independently considering the public_notice_function in interpreting the patent statutes`
this public_notice_function will be subverted if the` error' requirement is read out of the reissue_statute and patentees are given free reign to rewrite their claims whenever they find it expedient to do so
see hester indus. inc. v. stein inc. 142_f.3d_1472 1484 fed.cir.1998` [ h ] ere the second attorney draft [ ed ] the [ reissue ] claims nearly a decade later and with the distinct advantage of having before him the exact product offered by the now accused infringer

equity dictates that a patentee exercise due_diligence in seeking to rectify a defect in his patent
see miller v. bridgeport_brass_co. 104_u.s._350 351 26_l.ed._783_(1881) explaining that where a` mistake was so obvious as to be instantly discernible on opening the letters-patent' any right to have the patent reissued` was abandoned and lost by unreasonable_delay' ; gen._radio_co. v. allen_b
du mont labs. inc. 129_f.2d_608 612 3d cir.1942` it has long been settled that due_diligence must be exercised in discovering a mistake in a patent and that an unreasonable_delay in making application for reissue invalidates the reissue_patent`
the reasons for requiring prompt_action to correct a patent defect` may be just as great in a case where the patentee seeks to narrow his claims as where he seeks to broaden them'
gen._radio 129 f.2d at 613
where a patentee unjustifiably delays seeking reissue of overly broad_claims he` usurp [ s ] the right of the public to graze in the field erroneously claimed as a private preserve'
principle_bus enters. inc. v. united_states 7_cl.ct._433 438 cl.ct.1985 citations and internal quotation marks omitted ; gen._radio 129 f.2d at 613 emphasizing that failure to take prompt_action to narrow overly broad_claims gives a patentee an` unwarranted claim of monopoly'

here shionogi learned of the sandoz_reference no later than june 1991 when an internal_search_report issued in connection with the ¡¬440_application identified sandoz as relevant_prior_art
the importance of sandoz to the claims of the ¡¬440_patent was made clear when shionogi received in october 1992 the epo_search_report that identified sandoz as a` particularly relevant' standalone prior_art_reference
on february 21 1996 the epo rejected many of the claims in the european_counterpart to the ¡¬440_patent based upon sandoz
shionogi thereafter narrowed claim 1 in the european_application and added a claim specific to rosuvastatin
it waited for over two years however until august 1998 to seek reissue of the ¡¬440_patent
thus shionogi maintained the broad_claims of the ¡¬440_patent for more than seven years after learning of the sandoz_reference for more than six years after receiving the epo report identifying sandoz as particularly relevant stand-alone_prior_art for more than five years after issuance of the ¡¬440_patent and for two years after surrendering the corresponding claims in the european_application due to the sandoz_reference.5 it has proffered no adequate justification for its failure to rectify the alleged_error in the ¡¬440_patent in a timely manner

*538` the privilege of correcting an acknowledged error in [ an ] original_patent may in the public interest be validly conditioned upon the patentee proceeding promptly'
gen._radio 129 f.2d at 613
during the years when shionogi maintained its overbroad_claim there was strong and widespread interest in the development of new and more effective statins
joint_app
20148-51 ; 1755-57
by failing to act promptly to narrow its overbroad_claim shionogi deprived the public of the right to experiment with and to improve upon the compounds encompassed by claim 1.6 because shionogis delay in seeking to remedy the alleged defect in the ¡¬440_patent was unreasonable it has forfeited the right to obtain reissue under section 251

shionogi presents no plausible alternative explanation for its failure to specifically claim rosuvastatin
instead shionogi argues that it did not attempt to conceal rosuvastatin from bayer because rosuvastatin was described in the ¡¬440_patents specification
describing a compound in the examples contained in the specification however is unlikely to be the` red_flag' that narrowly claiming a compound would be particularly if that compound is the only one specifically claimed
