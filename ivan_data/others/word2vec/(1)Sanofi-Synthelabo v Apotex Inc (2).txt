opinion
lourie circuit_judge apotex inc. and apotex_corp. collectively referred to as` apotex' appeal from the decision of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york granting a preliminary_injunction in favor of sanofi-synthelabo sanofi-synthelabo inc. and bristol-myers squibb` bms' sanofi pharmaceuticals holding partnership collectively referred to as` sanofi'
because we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary_injunction we affirm

background
sanofi markets plavixthe_r a platelet_aggregation inhibiting agent used to reduce thrombotic_events such as heart_attacks and strokes
the active_ingredient in plavixthe_r is clopidogrel_bisulfate which is covered by sanofis patent u.s._patent 4,847,265` the ¡¬265_patent` which will expire on november 17 2011

to understand the issues presented in this appeal it is necessary to have a generalized understanding of stereochemistry
stereochemistry refers to the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of a molecules constituent atoms
molecules that have the same chemical substituents but different spatial arrangements are referred to as stereoisomers
if they contain an asymmetrical carbon atom they exist as non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are referred to as enantiomers
enantiomers are optically active because they are capable of rotating plane-polarized light ; enantiomers that rotate polarized light to the right are referred to as dextrorotatory enantiomers or d-enantiomers ; enantiomers rotating polarized light to the left are referred to as levorotatory_enantiomers or l-enantiomers.1 a mixture of equal amounts of both types of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or racemate and it exhibits no optical activity
clopidogrel is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of the free_base methyl_alpha-5- 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro 3,2-c thienopyridyl - 2-chlorophenyl acetate which the parties refer to as` mattpca'
the active_ingredient in plavixthe_r is the bisulfate_salt of the d-enantiomer of mattpca which is specifically recited in claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent

in november 2001 apotex filed an abbreviated_new_drug_application *1373` anda' pursuant to the hatch-waxman act seeking u.s. food and drug administration` fda' approval to manufacture and sell a generic_version of clopidogrel_bisulfate
apotex filed a paragraph iv certification with its anda pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv asserting that the ¡¬ 265 patent is invalid
in response sanofi sued apotex on march_21,_2002 claiming that the filing of the anda infringed the ¡¬265_patent
apotex counterclaimed asserting that the patent is invalid and unenforceable
a thirty-month stay of fda approval for the anda was triggered when the suit was filed in the district_court pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 5 b iii
the stay expired may_17,_2005 and on january 20 2006 the fda approved the anda

several days before the anda was approved sanofi and apotex began settlement_negotiations in an effort to resolve the litigation
on march_17,_2006 the parties reached a first settlement_agreement that was subject to the approval of the federal trade commission and a consortium of state attorneys general pursuant to an order issued in another litigation involving bms
in may 2006 the state attorneys general notified the parties that they would not approve the settlement
the parties negotiated a second agreement` the may_agreement'
the may_agreement included provisions specifying inter_alia actions that could be taken by the parties in the event that the settlement failed to receive regulatory approval
in july 2006 the state attorneys general again informed the parties that they would not approve the settlement
apotex then declared` regulatory_denial' on july_31,_2006 as permitted under the settlement_agreement which meant inter_alia` a denial of approval by either the ftc or a state attorney general as to which neither party seeks further review'
under the agreement litigation would resume in the event of` regulatory_denial'

pursuant to the aforementioned agreement apotex launched its generic clopidogrel_bisulfate product on august 8 2006
in accordance with the provisions in the settlement_agreement sanofi notified apotex of its intent to move for a preliminary_injunction in the time frame permitted by the agreement viz. five business days after the generic launch.2 sanofi filed its motion for a preliminary_injunction on august 15 2006 and requested a recall of apotexs products that were already distributed
after a two-day evidentiary hearing the district_court granted the motion for injunctive relief on august 31 2006 but denied the request for recall
during the period between the generic launch and the entry of the preliminary_injunction apotex shipped a six-month_supply of its product to distributors in the united states

in reaching its decision the district_court applied the established four-factor test for preliminary_injunctive_relief and found that the factors weighed in favor of an injunction
regarding the likelihood of success on the merits the court noted that apotex conceded that its accused products infringe claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent
the court then found that apotex failed to establish a likelihood of proving invalidity at trial-rejecting its anticipation obviousness and obviousness-type_double_patenting invalidity defenses
the court also determined that apotex failed to raise a substantial_question as to whether the ¡¬ *1374 265 patent is unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct
additionally the court found that the remaining three factors of the test favored issuance of a preliminary_injunction
as for apotexs other defenses the court concluded that the doctrine of laches was inapplicable and it rejected apotexs unclean_hands_defense
the court set bond in the amount of $ 400 million
trial is scheduled to commence on january 22 2007

apotex moved for a stay of the injunction which we denied on september 21 2006 and it filed its appeal from the district_courts grant of the preliminary_injunction
an expedited briefing schedule was set and oral_argument was heard on october 31 2006
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1292 c in view of ¡±¡± 1292 a and 1295 a 1

discussion
a decision to grant or deny a preliminary_injunction pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 283 is within the sound_discretion of the district_court and we review such a decision for an abuse of discretion
amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343 1350 fed.cir.2001
thus a decision granting a preliminary_injunction will be overturned on appeal only if it is established` that the court made a clear_error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual_findings'
genentech inc. v. novo nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1364 fed.cir.1997

tate access floors inc. v. interface architectural res. inc. 279_f.3d_1357 1364 fed.cir.2002

sanofi as the moving party may be entitled to a preliminary_injunction if it establishes four factors` 1 a reasonable likelihood of its success on the merits ; 2 irreparable_harm if an injunction is not granted ; 3 a balance of hardships tipping in its favor ; and 4 the injunctions.. impact on the public_interest'

a
likelihood of success on the merits
in order to satisfy the first_element of the test sanofi must demonstrate that` in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits' amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350 sanofi will likely prove that apotexs product infringes the ¡¬265_patent and that it will withstand apotexs challenges to the validity and enforceability of the ¡¬265_patent
because apotex stipulated to infringement only the second inquiry is at issue in this case
thus the first_element was properly found satisfied if apotex failed to raise a` substantial_question' with regard to the validity or enforceability of the ¡¬265_patent -or if it succeeded in doing so sanofi demonstrated that those defenses` lack substantial_merit'
genentech 108 f.3d at 1364
on appeal apotex challenges the district_courts rulings with respect to anticipation obviousness obviousness-type_double_patenting and enforceability

1
validity of the ¡¬265_patent
a
anticipation
we first consider whether the district_court clearly erred in its determination that sanofi will likely withstand apotexs challenge to the validity of the ¡¬265_patent based on anticipation
apotex asserted that u.s._patent 4,529,596` the ¡¬596_patent` anticipates claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent
the district_court rejected apotexs argument on two grounds
first the court found that the ¡¬596_patent does not describe clopidogrel_bisulfate
second the court determined that the ¡¬596_patent does not enable a person of ordinary_skill *1375 in the art to make clopidogrel_bisulfate without undue experimentation

on appeal apotex argues that the district_court erred by improperly focusing its anticipation analysis on claim 1 of the ¡¬596_patent which claims a broad genus of compounds and by failing to consider claim 2 which claims the free_base of clopidogrel mattpca
according to apotex claim 2 describes clopidogrel_bisulfate and thus anticipates claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent3 apotex advances two main arguments in support of this position
first apotex argues that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would interpret claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent in light of the specification as not only disclosing the racemate_free_base but also the dextrorotatory and levorotatory_enantiomers as well as pharmaceutically acceptable_salts including the bisulfate
second apotex contends that the district_court erred by failing to address controlling precedent specifically in re petering 49_c.c.p.a._993 301_f.2d_676_(1962) and in re schaumann 572_f.2d_312_(c.c.p.a.1978) which relate to genus/species anticipation
according to apotex those cases establish that the genus disclosed in claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent is a small class to which clopidogrel_bisulfate belongs which describes all members of that class

sanofi responds that the district_court correctly concluded that apotexs anticipation challenge lacks substantial_merit
sanofi contends that apotex engages in an impermissible hindsight-driven` dissection and recombination' analysis of the ¡¬596 specification in arguing that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would interpret the claim which only recites the racemate_free_base as disclosing the bisulfate_salt of the d-enantiomer
sanofi further argues that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in not addressing petering because it does not apply in this case

as a preliminary matter we note that the ¡¬596_patent was before the examiner during prosecution which makes apotexs burden of proving invalidity at trial` especially difficult'
glaxo group ltd. v. apotex inc. 376_f.3d_1339 1348 fed.cir.2004
thus in light of the deferential standard we apply in reviewing grants or denials of preliminary_injunctions and mindful that` a patent is presumed valid and this presumption exists at every stage of the litigation' canon computer sys. inc. v. nu-kote int¡¬l. inc. 134_f.3d_1085 1088 fed.cir.1998 we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that apotexs anticipation defense lacks substantial_merit.4

a determination that a patent is invalid as being anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 requires a finding that` each and every limitation is found either expressly or inherently in a single prior_art_reference'
celeritas techs ltd. v. rockwell int l corp. 150_f.3d_1354 1361 fed.cir.1998
claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent reads as follows 3
hydrogen sulfate of the dextro-rotatory_isomer of methyl_alpha-5 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro 3,2-c thienopyridyl 2-chlorophenyl -acetate substantially separated from the levo-rotatory_isomer
*1376 ¡¬265_patent col.12 ll.37-40
thus the claim consists of the following key limitations 1 the d-enantiomer ; 2 of the compound mattpca ; 3 the bisulfate_salt ; and 4 substantial separation from the levorotatory_isomer

claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent in contrast reads as follows 2
methyl a- 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-thieno 3,2-c -5-pyridyl o.chlorophenyl-acetate.5

¡¬596_patent col.13 ll.20-21
thus the plain language of claim 2 only recites the free_base mattpca and does not expressly describe the dextrorotatory or levorotatory_enantiomers or any salt
because claim 2 fails to describe each and every limitation of claim 3 on its face claim 2 does not anticipate claim 3

apotex argues that the two missing limitations viz. the d-enantiomer and the bisulfate_salt are inherently disclosed in the claim
with regard to the bisulfate_salt_limitation apotex seeks to import into the scope of claim 2 a statement in the specification that the invention includes` addition_salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids'
id. col.1 ll.42-43
apotex further argues that the ¡¬596_patent discloses a preference for bisulfate_salt

the district_court however considered that argument and rejected it
after careful consideration of the record before it the court found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not be led to the bisulfate_salt for several reasons
based on the testimony of sanofis expert dr._byrn the court noted that a chemist would actually be dissuaded from preparing the bisulfate_salt in light of example 1 which describes the hydrochloride_salt of the racemate because a chemist would believe that the hydrochloride as opposed to the bisulfate is the preferred salt for clopidogrel
the court also credited dr._byrns additional testimony that salt_formation with a new compound is an` unpredictable_exercise'
in addition the court noted that a chemist theoretically had at least fifty different pharmaceutically acceptable_salts from which he could have chosen for formulation
based on that evidence the court found that` disclosing bisulfate in the ¡¬596_patent was insufficient to disclose a single enantiomer of a compound as a bisulfate_salt'
sanofi-synthelabo slip op.at 26
because we find that the district_court did not clearly err in its fact-finding as to this issue we reject apotexs argument that claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent inherently discloses the bisulfate_salt.6

apotex argues that the holding in in re may 574_f.2d_1082_(c.c.p.a_1978) specifically with respect to claim 6-a claim that the court of customs and patent_appeals found anticipated by prior_art-mandates a finding of anticipation here
that case however is distinguishable from this case
in may our predecessor_court held that claim 6 which claimed the hydrochloride *1377 salt of a class of compounds or genus was anticipated by a prior_art_patent that expressly disclosed the hydrobromide_salt of a species included within the genus
the appellant argued that the prior_art_patent did not anticipate the hydrochloride because it did not` specifically describe' it
the court disagreed in light of a statement in the specification that the compounds of the genus were` preferably administered in the form of their saltsthe hydrobromide and hydrochloride_salts being especially suitable
`` id.at 1090 emphases added
the court found that that statement` coupled with the express disclosure of the hydrobromide_salt of the [ species compound ]' constituted an anticipation of claim 6
id
here however there is no clear statement in the specification that the bisulfate_salt is` especially suitable' for administering compounds of the genus including clopidogrel
on the contrary as discussed above the specification of the ¡¬596_patent discloses a number of potentially acceptable_salts and discloses the racemate of clopidogrel in example 1 only as a hydrochloride_salt
thus we find the facts in the present_case distinguishable from those in may

further we are not persuaded by apotexs argument that the holdings of in re petering and in re schaumann warrant reversal of the district_courts decision
in petering the court of customs and patent_appeals upheld the boards ¡± 102 b anticipation rejection of a claim that covered specific chemical compounds in light of a prior_art_patent that disclosed a class of compounds of which those specific_compounds were members
301 f.2d at 682
in reaching its conclusion the court noted that while the generic_formula in petering was quite broad` specific preferences' were described
based on those disclosed preferences the court found that the narrowed generic_formula essentially disclosed a limited_class of approximately twenty compounds
each was held to have been disclosed by the genus

similarly in schaumann the court of customs and patent_appeals affirmed the rejection of claims that covered a specific_compound and certain compatible salts in light of a prior_art_patent that disclosed a generic_formula with a single variable
the court found that the prior_art_patent disclosed a limited_class of compounds based on a disclosed preference for that variable substituent
the court concluded that the compound in the rejected claim fell within the scope of that limited_class of compounds and thus was anticipated by the prior_art_patent

here however we do not find that the ¡¬596_patent discloses a` pattern of preferences' akin to the disclosures in petering and schaumann that would limit the generic_formula of mattpca in claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent to a narrow_class of compounds that includes clopidogrel_bisulfate
the principal obvious distinction is that the generic_formula of claim 2 does not include a salt
on this basis alone we find that clopidogrel_bisulfate is not a species of any genus comprised by claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent

in addition our predecessor_court found a` pattern of preferences' in petering and schaumann
in this case however there is no such clear` pattern of preferences' that serves to narrow the genus in claim 2 to a narrow_class that includes clopidogrel_bisulfate
even had claim 2 included salts generically there was no expressed preference for clopidogrel_bisulfate
the ¡¬596_patent specification discloses twenty-one exemplary compounds that are thienopyridines-not just mattpca
the examples describe hydrochloride_salts hydrobromide_salts a sodium salt an oxalate and a free_base as well as bisulfates not showing a preference for bisulfates
thus *1378 we find this case distinguishable from petering and schaumann on that additional_basis viz. that the ¡¬596_patent does not point to bisulfates as preferred salts for clopidogrel

we therefore reject apotexs assertion that clopidogrel_bisulfate is a species of the genus in claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent and that the district_court clearly erred by failing to so find
in light of this holding we need not address the enablement issue
accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding no substantial_merit to apotexs assertion that claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent is anticipated by the ¡¬596_patent7

b. obviousness
we next consider apotexs assertion that claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent is invalid as obvious
apotex argues that the district_court erred in concluding that its obviousness_defense failed to raise a substantial_question with regard to the validity of the ¡¬265_patent
apotex primarily argues that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art to prepare clopidogrel_bisulfate based on the disclosure of the ¡¬596_patent
additionally apotex asserts that the` unexpected_results' upon which sanofi relied to establish the nonobviousness of clopidogrel_bisulfate were not` unexpected' to a person of ordinary_skill in the art
moreover apotex contends that the court erred by failing to cite adamson in its obviousness_analysis-a case that according to apotex stands for the proposition that enantiomers are prima_facie obvious over disclosures of their racemates

sanofi responds that the district_court correctly concluded that it would not have been obvious to prepare clopidogrel_bisulfate in view of the ¡¬ 596 patent particularly in light of the effort sanofi actually had to expend in developing clopidogrel_bisulfate including the four years and millions of dollars that were allocated to the development of the racemate before efforts were redirected toward isolating the d-enantiomer
sanofi further argues that any prima_facie obviousness resulting from the disclosure of the racemate in the prior_art was rebutted by the unexpected properties of clopidogrel_bisulfate-specifically high pharmacological activity and low toxicity-two properties that are not necessarily generally associated with one enantiomer

we agree with sanofi that the court did not clearly err in finding that apotex failed to raise a substantial_question in its obviousness_defense
first we reject apotexs contention that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art to prepare clopidogrel_bisulfate based on the disclosures of the ¡¬596_patent
the district_court rejected that position after considering extensive argument testimony and references presented by both parties
in reaching that determination the district_court noted that there was` nothing obvious about arriving at clopidogrel_bisulfate by separating the enantiomers of [ mattpca ] and preparing the dextrorotatory [ enantiomer ] as a bisulfate_salt'
sanofi-synthelabo slip op.at 31-32
the court determined that nothing existed in the prior_art that would make pursuing the enantiomer of mattpca an obvious *1379 choice particularly in light of the unpredictability of the pharmaceutical properties of the enantiomers and the potential for enantiomers to racemize in the body

the court also found that the extensive time and money sanofi spent developing the racemate before redirecting its efforts toward the enantiomer and the unpredictability of salt_formation were indicators of nonobviousness
the court credited the testimony of apotexs own expert dr. mcclelland who agreed that salt_formation was an unpredictable_exercise that would require a chemist` to engage in experimentation to determine which salt would in fact be suitable'
id.at 33
the court also noted that a named inventor dr. badorc tested twenty different salts before discovering that bisulfate had the most desirable properties
thus the court found that it would not have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art to prepare clopidogrel_bisulfate from reading the ¡¬596_patent in light of the extensive experimentation that was required to arrive at that particular compound
we discern no clear_error with respect to those factual determinations or the legal conclusion

we also reject apotexs assertion that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been led to the active enantiomer of mattpca after reading the ¡¬596_patent
apotex merely asserts that one would have been motivated` because the patent directs [ a person of ordinary_skill in the art ] to enantiomers and pharmaceutical salts'
we have noted that it is insufficient to merely identify each element in the prior_art to establish unpatentability of the combined subject matter as a whole
abbott labs
v. andrx pharm. inc. 452_f.3d_1331 1336 fed.cir.2006
instead` a party alleging invalidity due to obviousness must articulate the reasons one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to select the references and to combine them to render the claimed invention obvious'
id
apotexs conclusory assertion that the ¡¬596_patent directs a chemist to the enantiomers and salts is insufficient to satisfy this requirement
certainly nothing directed a chemist to the particular enantiomer and salt clopidogrel_bisulfate which is the limited subject matter of claim 3

second while apotex disagrees with the district_courts assessment of the evidence relating to the` unexpected_results' obtained with clopidogrel_bisulfate we review that assessment which is based on factual_findings made by the district_court for clear_error
based on the record before us we find no basis to conclude that the district_court clearly erred in its evaluation of that evidence

finally we are unpersuaded by apotexs argument that the court clearly erred by failing to consider adamson in its obviousness_analysis
in adamson the ccpa affirmed the boards rejection of claims that covered the l-enantiomer of a specific_compound and its addition_salts as obvious in view of certain prior_art_references
one prior_art_reference disclosed` synthetically produced compounds of the same formula claimed' but did not state whether the compounds were racemic_mixtures or enantiomers
adamson 275 f.2d at 953
another prior_art_reference an organic chemistry textbook taught inter_alia that racemates may be separated into their enantiomers by various methods and that enantiomers often possess substantially different physiological properties in comparison to each other
thus the court found the claimed l-enantiomer salt unpatentable despite the fact that that enantiomer exhibited substantially greater spasmolytic activity than its dextrorotatory counterpart

*1380 apotex contends that adamson is` no different' from the present_case
we disagree
this case is distinguishable on at least two grounds
first it was undisputed in adamson that the primary reference disclosed the racemic_mixtures of the isomers and the acid addition_salts
id.at 954
here and most importantly the ¡¬596_patent does not disclose the bisulfate_salt of the d-enantiomer of mattpca
resolution of a racemic free_base does not lead to a particular unnamed salt
second the adamson court observed that it would have been expected by one of skill in the art that enantiomers would have different pharmacological activity and that the toxicity of the racemate would lie somewhere between that of its isomers
in this case the district_court made factual_findings that resolving the racemate was not mere routine experimentation and that it was unexpected that the desirable activity of clopidogrel would be found only in the d-enantiomer
we do not consider that those findings are clearly erroneous
accordingly adamson is distinguishable on that additional_basis

based on the preliminary record before us we thus find that the district_court did not err in determining that apotex failed to raise a substantial_question as to the validity of claim 3 based on obviousness

c. obviousness-type double patenting
in the district_court apotex also challenged the validity of claim 3 of the ¡¬ 265 patent based on obviousness-type_double_patenting
apotex argues that the court committed clear_error in concluding that the double_patenting_inquiry was subsumed by the broader obviousness inquiry and by failing to specifically address this claim
apotex asserts that an obviousness inquiry is distinct from the double_patenting_inquiry and should have been independently analyzed
sanofi responds that the court correctly concluded that nothing in the prior_art including the ¡¬596_patent rendered claim 3 obvious
claim 2 of the ¡¬ 596 patent especially did not render claim 3 obvious

while apotex asserts that the court erred by failing to separately address its double patenting defense apotex fails to set forth any arguments on appeal that raise a substantial_question with respect to the validity of claim 3 based on that defense
accordingly we reject apotexs argument that the grant of the preliminary_injunction should be reversed on that basis

2
enforceability of the ¡¬265_patent
apotex argues that the district_court abused its discretion in finding that apotex failed to raise a substantial_question as to the enforceability of the ¡¬265_patent
apotex identifies separate bases upon which it asserts inequitable_conduct should have been found
they include incorrect inventorship concealment of research regarding other compounds that were tested by sanofi and purported false statements concerning the` unexpected_results' of clopidogrel_bisulfate and the` less well-tolerated' statement referring to the l-enantiomer
sanofi responds to each of apotexs assertions explaining why none of apotexs arguments raises a substantial_question as to the ¡¬265_patents enforceability

`` a patent may be rendered unenforceable for inequitable_conduct if an applicant with intent to mislead or deceive the examiner fails to disclose material information or submits materially false information to the pto during prosecution'
digital control inc. v. charles mach
works 437_f.3d_1309 1313 fed.cir.2006
`` the party asserting inequitable_conduct must prove a threshold_level of materiality and intent by clear and convincing evidence'
*1381 id
further` materiality does not presume intent which is a separate and essential component of inequitable_conduct'
gfi inc. v. franklin corp. 265_f.3d_1268 1274 fed.cir.2001 quoting manville sales corp. v. paramount sys. inc. 917_f.2d_544 552 fed.cir.1990

while apotex devotes a significant portion of its briefs to argue its inequitable_conduct contentions virtually none of its discussion is devoted to identifying any evidence that would support a finding of deceptive_intent
apotexs evidence of intent is limited to a statement in apotexs reply brief that the inventors declaration which excluded dr. maffrand as an inventor is evidence of intent
moreover apotex suggests that intent can be inferred because` sanofi was motivated to extend its patent monopoly beyond the ¡¬596_patent term by patenting the enantiomer and it needed to conjure upunexpected results'
such generalized allegations lack the particularity required to meet the threshold_level of deceptive_intent necessary for a finding of inequitable_conduct
thus based on the record before us apotex clearly fails to raise a substantial_question as to the enforceability of the ¡¬ 265 patent.8 accordingly we find no abuse of discretion with regard to that issue

b
other preliminary injunction factors
we next consider the remaining elements of the preliminary_injunction test
the district_court applied a presumption of irreparable_harm in light of its conclusion that sanofi established a likelihood of success on the merits
the court also found that sanofi proffered substantial evidence establishing other forms of irreparable_harm including irreversible_price_erosion loss of good_will potential lay-offs of sanofi employees and the discontinuance of clinical_trials that are devoted to other medical uses for plavixthe_r

apotex argues that the district_court clearly erred in concluding that sanofi would suffer irreparable_harm in the absence of an injunction
according to apotex the settlement_agreement entered into by sanofi and apotex negated any finding of irreparable_harm
apotex contends that sanofi quantified in the may_agreement the measure of harm it would suffer in the event apotex marketed a generic_product-specifically 40 % -50 % of apotexs net_sales
additionally apotex challenges the courts findings with regard to the other kinds of irreparable_harm established by sanofi

in response sanofi argues that it did not contractually surrender its right to prove irreparable_harm by entering into the may_agreement
moreover sanofi asserts that the court did not clearly err by crediting the evidence it proffered establishing the additional kinds of irreparable_harm it would suffer if apotex were allowed to continue selling its generic_product

we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that sanofi satisfied this factor
we are not persuaded by apotexs assertion that sanofi contracted away its right to prove irreparable_harm by entering into the may_agreement which includes a provision that capped damages for infringement by apotex
in support of this argument apotex refers to the following provision 14
in the event of regulatory denial the litigations will be resumed as further described in paragraph 15 hereof and

*1382 * * * ii if the litigation results in a judgment that the ¡¬265_patent is not invalid or unenforceable sanofi agrees that its actual damages for any past_infringement by apotex up to the date on which apotex is enjoined will be 50 % of apotexs net_sales of clopidogrel products if sanofi has not launched an authorized generic and 40 % of apotexs net_sales if sanofi has launched an authorized generic
sanofi further agrees that it will not seek increased damages under 35 u.s.c.¡± 284
may_agreement ?
14
we think that the above_provision favors sanofi not apotex
we disagree with apotex that by entering into that agreement sanofi bargained away its right to seek preliminary_injunctive_relief and thus its right to prove irreparable_harm in the event the settlement was not approved
the above_provision itself contemplates an injunction in referring to` up to the date on which apotex is enjoined' and speaks only of damages for past_infringement
in addition based on other provisions in the agreement it is clear that the parties contemplated the possibility of a preliminary_injunction in the event of regulatory_denial
paragraph 15 of the agreement for example sets forth the procedural steps the parties must follow when seeking a preliminary_injunction
moreover merely because a patentee is able to identify a monetary amount that it deems sufficient to avoid or end litigation does not necessarily mean that it automatically foregoes its right to seek a preliminary_injunction or that any potential irreparable injury ceases to exist if infringement resumes
thus apotexs argument is unsound

further we reject apotexs assertion that the district_court abused its discretion in concluding that sanofi would suffer irreversible_price_erosion if an injunction were not entered
based on the evidence sanofi adduced including the testimony of its economics expert professor hausman and a declaration from a sanofi executive hugh o'neill the court found that sanofi would suffer irreversible_price_erosion in light of a complex pricing scheme that is directly affected by the presence of the generic_product in the market
in particular the court found that since apotexs generic_product entered the market sanofi has been forced to offer discounted rates and price concessions to third-party payors such as health maintenance organizations in order to keep plavixthe_r on a favorable pricing tier which governs what consumers pay for that drug
the court found that the availability of a generic_product encourages third party payors to place plavixthe_r on a less favorable tier thereby requiring consumers to pay a higher co-pay and perhaps deterring them from purchasing plavixthe_r
the court identified additional consequences of unfavorable tier placement including a decrease in demand for plavixthe_r
according to sanofi it is nearly impossible to restore plavixthe_r to its pre-launch price since the generic_product entered the market

apotex does not argue that price_erosion is not a valid ground for finding irreparable_harm but rather challenges the district_courts findings as to price_erosion
we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in its evaluation of the evidence relating to price_erosion
while apotex asserts that price_erosion had already occurred and thus an injunction is not necessary because it can not ameliorate sanofis position apotex fails to identify clear_errors in the district_courts analysis and fails to proffer evidence of its own sufficient to rebut the courts findings
apotex also fails to demonstrate that the court clearly erred in its findings with respect to *1383 the additional factors that established irreparable_harm including loss of good_will the potential reduction in work force and the discontinuation of clinical_trials
accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding irreparable_harm.9

as to the third factor of the test apotex argues that the court erred in balancing the hardships because it ignored the harm apotex would face if an injunction were granted particularly in light of the settlement_agreement which according to apotex demonstrates that the harms sanofi would suffer are a result of its own conduct
sanofi responds that the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that that factor favored sanofi particularly because it was apotexs own decision to engage in an at-risk launch that would trigger its 180-day exclusivity period before reaching the merits of the case
based on the record on appeal we conclude that the court did not clearly err in finding that apotexs harms were` almost entirely preventable' and were the result of its own calculated risk to launch its product pre-judgment
sanofi-synthelabo slip op.at 48
accordingly the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the balance of hardships tipped in sanofis favor

the fourth factor we consider is the public_interest which the court found tips in favor of sanofi albeit slightly
apotex as well as amici,10 argue that the district_court erred in failing to consider certain public harms that would result if an injunction issues
apotex in particular contends that if the generic_products were removed from the market consumers would be inclined not to purchase their medication because of the accompanying price increase for the brand name drug leading to possible deaths
apotex further argues that significant consumer confusion may ensue because of the six-month_supply that was shipped to the american market which was not equally distributed among vendors
sanofi responds that the court did not clearly err in finding that the interest in encouraging pharmaceutical research and development outweighed the public_interest advanced by apotex

we agree with sanofi
while apotex raises legitimate concerns the district_court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that those concerns were outweighed by the public_interests identified by sanofi
we have long acknowledged the importance of the patent_system in encouraging innovation
indeed the` encouragement of investment-based risk is the fundamental purpose of the patent grant and is based directly on the right to exclude'
patlex corp. v. mossinghoff 758_f.2d_594 599 fed.cir.1985
the district_court relied on the testimony of dr. hausman in finding that the average cost of developing a blockbuster drug is $ 800 million
importantly the patent_system provides incentive to the innovative drug companies to continue costly development efforts
we therefore find that the court did not clearly err in concluding that the *1384 significant` public_interest in encouraging investment in drug development and protecting the exclusionary rights conveyed in valid pharmaceutical patents' tips the scales in favor of sanofi

c. unclean hands
having concluded that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial judges determination that the four factors of the preliminary_injunction test favor an injunction we next consider apotexs argument concerning unclean_hands
apotex argues that the district_court erred by precluding apotex from introducing evidence that counsel for bms and sanofi allegedly engaged in fraudulent misconduct during settlement_negotiations by concealing oral side agreements from regulators and falsely certifying that such agreements did not exist
the district_court excluded that evidence from the preliminary_injunction hearing reasoning that the` conduct of the parties during settlement_negotiations does not affect the validity of the patent or the veracity of submissions to [ the district_court ] and therefore has no relevance to the question of whether a preliminary_injunction should issue'
id.at 55

we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion by precluding apotex from asserting this defense
apotex contends the court clearly erred by disregarding precision instrument manufacturing co. v. automotive maintenance machinery co. 324_u.s._806 65_s.ct._993 89_l.ed._1381_(1945)
that case however is not on point
there the plaintiff sought to enforce several patents and contracts that were obtained as a result of a settlement_agreement entered into by the parties in order to resolve an interference proceeding during which the parties either committed perjury before the patent office or concealed their knowledge of the perjury
the supreme_court applied the unclean_hands doctrine and dismissed plaintiffs patent infringement and breach of contract claims
in doing so the court noted the public policy interest against asserting and enforcing patent claims that are` infected with fraud and perjury'
id.at 819 65_s.ct._993

apotexs unclean_hands_defense however is not based on fraud or perjury that counsel for bms or sanofi allegedly committed while obtaining the ¡¬265_patent but instead relates to the settlement_agreement entered into between sanofi and apotex well after the patent was obtained
because the claims at issue in the grant of the preliminary_injunction concern infringement and validity of the ¡¬265_patent as opposed to issues relating to the settlement_agreement itself we find that the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding such evidence in the context of the preliminary_injunction motion
see keystone driller co. v. gen. excavator co. 290_u.s._240 245 54_s.ct._146 78_l.ed._293_(1933) noting the courts discretion in applying the unclean_hands doctrine when a plaintiffs alleged misconduct` has no relation to anything involved in the suit'

d. bond
lastly apotex challenges the courts decision to set bond in the amount of $ 400 million which it asserts fails to provide sufficient security because it represents only 10 % of the annual market and ignores apotexs loss of market_share
sanofi responds that the amount far exceeds any damage apotex may face particularly in light of the fact that there was no recall of apotexs generic_product after it launched its product on august 8 2006

the posting of a bond is governed by federal rule of civil procedure 65 c which provides that no restraining order or preliminary_injunction shall issue except upon the giving *1385 of security by the applicant in such sum as the court deems proper for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained
fed.r.civ.p
65 c
the amount of a bond is a determination that rests within the sound_discretion of a trial court
doctors assocs. inc. v. distajo 107_f.3d_126 136 2d cir.1997 noting that a district_court has wide discretion under rule 65 c in setting the amount of a bond
the court based its determination on evidence presented before the court that concerned apotexs` potential lost profits lost market_share and associated costs of relaunch' in the event of wrongful enjoinment
sanofi-synthelabo slip op.at 57
we find no basis for disturbing the courts assessment of the facts and thus conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in setting the bond amount

conclusion
we have considered apotexs remaining arguments with respect to the myriad of issues it has raised on appeal and find them unpersuasive
we therefore conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting preliminary_injunctive_relief
accordingly for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts grant of the preliminary_injunction
we wish to note that while we have carefully considered all of the arguments presented to us in reviewing the district_courts grant of the preliminary_injunction we have done so in the context of the standard of review applicable to grant of preliminary_injunctions and that the district_court is not bound to its earlier conclusions on full trial on the merits
we leave to that court the conduct of any further proceedings

affirmed

3
in this appeal we are faced with the unusual situation of an anticipating disclosure being argued to be a claim rather than other descriptive material in a specification
no doubt appellants argued what they considered to be their strongest case
4
in its moving brief and as counsel clarified at oral_argument apotexs anticipation argument on appeal is solely premised on claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent
thus we limit our discussion to the narrow issue whether there is substantial_merit to apotexs assertion that claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent is unpatentable in view of claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent
5
the parties do not dispute that` methyl a- 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-thi eno 3,2-c -5-pyridyl -o.chlorophenyl-acetate' recited in claim 2 of the ¡¬596_patent is the same compound as` methyl_alpha-5 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro 3,2-c thienopyridyl 2-chlorophenyl acetate' recited in claim 3 of the ¡¬265_patent
both names although slightly different in form refer to the same free_base mattpca
the punctuation of the names is as it appears in the particular patents
6
apotex cites in re adamson 47_c.c.p.a._839 275_f.2d_952 954 1960 for the proposition that the disclosure of a racemic compound inherently discloses its enantiomers
thus apotex argues that the d-enantiomer of mattpca is inherently disclosed by claim 2
because we conclude that the district_court did not err in finding that the bisulfate_salt_limitation is not disclosed in the claim and thus can not anticipate claim 3 we need not address this contention
7
to the extent that apotex argues that portions of the ¡¬596_patent other than claim 2 anticipate clopidogrel_bisulfate we reject that argument
although several of the examples in the ¡¬596_patent are salts of esters the specification does not identify as a class esters in salt form
this case is therefore unlike petering in which the prior_art_reference named a class examples of which were then taken as expressing preferred species of that class
similarly because no class-wide salt preferences are disclosed may does not support a finding of anticipation
8
because both materiality and intent are required to establish inequitable_conduct we need not address the materiality of the purported false statement or omissions that apotex describes in its briefs
9
apotex also argues that the district_court erred by applying a presumption of irreparable_harm because sanofi established a likelihood of success on the merits
apotex contends that applying such a presumption is in direct contravention of the supreme_courts decision in ebay inc. v. mercexchange l.l.c. 547_u.s._388 126_s.ct._1837 164_l.ed.2d_641_(2006)
because we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that sanofi established several kinds of irreparable_harm including irreversible_price_erosion we need not address this contention
