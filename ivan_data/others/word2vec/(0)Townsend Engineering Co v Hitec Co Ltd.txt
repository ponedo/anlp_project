*1087 friedman circuit_judge
this is an appeal from a judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois granting summary_judgment for the defendant in a patent infringement suit
the court found that there was no infringement either literal or under the doctrine of equivalents
we affirm

i
the invention the patent no._3694,853 the853_patent discloses is a sausage-stuffing machine
this case involves the` looper_horn' claimed in the853_patent which loops stuffed sausages on hooks for further processing

the appellant townsend_engineering company townsend obtained the853_patent by assignment from its inventor charles austin greider
townsend also owned an earlier and now expired u.s. patent no._3191,222 the222_patent on a sausage-stuffing machine issued to its chief_executive_officer ray t. townsend

encasing machines made according to the222_patent had difficulty handling delicate casing material because of the shape of the machines looper_horn
in his specification in the853_patent greider explained that he could avoid the tearing problems encountered in machines manufactured under the222_patent by changing the shape and geometry of the looper_horn the horn_extension shown in u.s. pat
no._3191,222 is helical or spiral in shape whereas the horn_extension of the present_invention is substantially straight and disposed at an angle with respect to the rotational_axis of the bearing_means horn base 202 which supports the horn_extension

the application for the853_patent originally included 27 claims
claim 27 of the application which as amended is now claim 5 of the853_patent the claim covering the looper_horn is the only claim relevant in this appeal
in pertinent part claim 27 set forth
an elongated_tube-like_horn_extension having first and second ends and a longitudinal base [ sic bore ] extending therethrough for slidably receiving said casing said first_end of said horn_extension being adapted to receive said casing ; bearing_means on said support having an axis of rotation and rotatably supporting said first_end of said horn_extension the longitudinal_axis of said horn_extension being substantially straight and forming an angle with respect to said axis of rotation of said bearing_means..

in the first office action the patent_examiner rejected claim 27 as anticipated by the looper_horn of the222_patent
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 1982
in response greider cancelled claim 27 and substituted claim 30 which ultimately became claim 5 of the853_patent
the most significant differences between claim 30 and claim 27 relate to the shape and length of the looper_horn
the relevant portion of claim 30 is reproduced below with underlining and brackets showing the language added to and deleted from claim 27 an elongated_tube-like_horn_extension having first and second_end_portions [ ends ] and a [ longitudinal ] bore extending therethrough and therebetween for slidably receiving said casing [ said first_end of said horn_extension being adapted to receive said casing ] said second_end_portion having a length substantially greater than the length of said first_end_portion bearing_means on said support having an axis of rotation and rotatably supporting said first_end_portion of said horn_extension said second_end_portion having a [ the ] longitudinal_axis [ of said horn_extension ] which is [ being ] substantially straight and which is angularly disposed [ and forming an angle ] with respect to the longitudinal_axis of said first_end_portion and angularly disposed with respect to said axes of rotation of said bearing_means..

in the remarks explaining the substitution of claim 30 for claim 27 greider noted that the looper_horn of the application differed from that in the222_patent because the latter was both curved and rotating *1088 in the specification [ greider ] recognized that looping horns such as the one disclosed in the [222_patent ] have been previously used for looping link casings but it was specifically stated at page 18 of the specification that previous horns have not been adapted to handle delicate casings satisfactorily
the horn_extension shown in the [222 ] patent is helical or spiral in shape whereas the horn_extension of the present_invention is substantially straight and disposed at an angle with respect to the rotational_axis of the bearing_means which supports the horn_extension
the result of the device described in claim 30 is that the casings are gently swung back and forth for looping over the hooks of the conveyor
this action is gentler and less likely to cause tearing of the casing than the action obtained from the previous helical horn

with these changes claim 30 was issued as claim 5 of the853_patent

townsend filed the present suit against appellee hitec co. ltd. hitec alleging that hitecs` auto_wienker' sausage-stuffing machine infringed claim 5 of the853_patent
the patented and accused looper_horns are illustrated below

?
hitec moved for summary_judgment of non-infringement asserting that the auto_wienker did not infringe either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
the district_court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint
the court ruled that in order to infringe claim 5 literally hitecs looper_horn had to consist of two parts one part of which is 1 substantially longer than the other_part and 2 substantially straight
in addition the horn must be rotated by a bearing_means that supports the shorter_part of the horn
finally the longer_part of the horn must be set off at an angle from the shorter_part

the district_court noted that unlike the two-part substantially straight horn claimed in the853_patent the auto_wienkers *1089 horn was` a one-piece continuously curved plastic tube..' id.at 1989-90
because it found that` even a cursory examination of the auto_wienker horn establishes it does not truly have any of those crucial properties of the [ looper_horn disclosed in the853_patent ]' the court determined that there was no literal_infringement
id.at 1989 emphasis in original

the court also rejected townsends contention that the accused device infringed under the doctrine of equivalents
the court held that townsend was barred by the doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel from reading claim 5 to cover a looper_horn like that embodied in the222_patent [ claim 5 of the853_patent ] was amended after an initial rejection by the patent_examiner
that amendment was necessary to distinguish claim 5 from material already embraced by the [222 ] patent and therefore found to have been anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
because the looper_horn in the [222 ] patent was curved or spiral greider was forced to add the limitation that his own looper_horn comprises two parts one of which is longer than and angularly disposed to the shorter_part
indeed greiders attorney emphasized the newlynarrowed description of the looper_horn in the argument that accompanied amended claim 5
in light of that prosecution_history townsend is estopped from using the doctrine of equivalents to avoid the specific words of limitation greider chose to add to claim 5 to obtain issuance of his patent..
accordingly townsend can not argue the curved single-piece auto_wienker looper_horn an embodiment abandoned in claim 5 as amended is the functional equivalent of the substantially straight two-piece greider looper_horn.. id.at 1990-91 footnote and citations omitted

although infringement either literal or under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact see graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 609 70_s.ct._854 856 94_l.ed._1097 85_uspq_328 331 1950` [ s ] ummary judgment is as appropriate in a patent case as in any other where no genuine issue of material_fact is present and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law'

thus the granting of summary_judgment will be upheld` where the claims do notread on the accused structure' to establish literal_infringement` and a prosecution_history_estoppel makes clear that no actual infringement under the doctrine of equivalents can be found'

townsend contends that there are disputed issues of material_fact relating to both literal_infringement and infringement by equivalents that precluded the grant of summary_judgment and that in any event the district_court erred in holding that the doctrine of prosecution_history_estoppel bars townsend from invoking the doctrine of equivalents
to establish the existence of disputed issues of material_fact townsend relies mainly upon the affidavit of its chief_executive_officer mr._townsend which it asserts established the existence of nine disputed issues of material_fact
townsend further asserts that in granting summary_judgment the district_court ignored the townsend_affidavit and improperly resolved factual_issues that could be determined only after a trial

we have concluded however that the district_court correctly held that there are no disputed issues of material_fact and that on the undisputed facts hitec was entitled to judgment as a matter of law
the townsend_affidavit largely consists of mr._townsends opinion about the meaning and application of various phrases and provisions of claim 5 and does not create factual disputes that precluded the grant of summary_judgment

denied 474_u.s._825 106_s.ct._83 88_l.ed.2d_68_(1985) affidavit which fails to raise specific issues of material_fact insufficient to preclude grant of summary_judgment

a. literal infringement
the district_court correctly determined that there were no genuine_issues of material_fact regarding literal_infringement by the accused device
`` literal infringement requires that the accused device embody every element of the claim'
builders_concrete 757 f.2d at 257 225 uspq at 241
claim 5 of the853_patent is drawn to a two-part horn and literally requires that 1 one part of the horn must be substantially longer than the other_part and 2 that this longer_portion must be substantially straight
in addition the horn must be rotatable by a bearing_means that supports the shorter_part of the horn
furthermore the longer_part of the horn must` be angularly disposed with respect to' the shorter_part of the horn

the district_court correctly determined that the accused device differs markedly from the horn claimed in the853_patent
see townsend_eng g 1 uspq2d at 1989-90
unlike the two-part device claimed in the853_patent the accused device consists of a single_piece of plastic_tubing
while the patented_device rotates the accused device oscillates between two points
furthermore although the patented_device has two portions one of which is` substantially straight' the accused device consists of a single_piece that is continuously curved along its entire_length

because the accused device does not embody every element of claim 5 of the853_patent the district_court correctly granted hitecs motion for summary_judgment on the literal_infringement issue

b. doctrine of equivalents
the district_court also correctly determined that there were no genuine_issues of material_fact regarding infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
under that doctrine an accused product that does not literally infringe a structural claim may infringe` if it performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain the same result'
graver_tank 339 u.s. at 608 70 s.ct.at 856 85 uspq at 330 quoting sanitary refrigerator co. v. winters 280_u.s._30 42 50_s.ct._9 13 74_l.ed._147_(1929) ; hughes aircraft co. v. united_states 717_f.2d_1351 1361 219_uspq_473 480 fed.cir.1983

the doctrine of equivalents however is limited by prosecution_history_estoppel which` limits a patentees reliance on the doctrine of equivalents by preventing him from contending later in an infringement action that his claims should be interpreted as if limitations added by amendment were not present..' thomas & betts corp. v. litton sys. inc. 720_f.2d_1572 1579 220_uspq_1 6 fed.cir.1983

prosecution history estoppel applies both` to claim amendments to overcome rejections based on prior_art and to arguments submitted to obtain the patent'
hughes aircraft 717 f.2d at 1362 219 uspq at 481 citations omitted
when claim 5 of the accused device was originally submitted the patent_examiner rejected it as having been anticipated by the222_patent
because the222_patent disclosed a one-part spiral or helical looper_horn the patentee added the limitations that its own horn consists of two` portions' one of which is` substantially straight' and which has a length` substantially greater' than the other_portion
the patentee also added the limitation that the second_end_portion of its horn is angularly disposed to the first_end_portion

in the remarks explaining the substitution of claim 30 for claim 27 the patentee emphasized the difference in length between the first and second_end_portions of the looper_horn the claim describes that the second_end_portion has a length substantially greater *1091 than the length of the first_end_portion

the patentee also pointed out that the second_end_portion of the looper_horn was substantially straight the horn_extension shown in the [222 ] patent is helical or spiral in shape whereas the horn_extension of the present_invention is substantially straight..

contrary to townsends contention these amendments were not limited to avoiding the`helical or spiral nature' of the horn of the222_patent but imposed broader limitations upon the claim

having added limitations to avoid the device disclosed in the prior_art townsend is barred by prosecution_history_estoppel from interpreting his claim as broadly as the claim originally filed
the accused device like the prior_art embodied in the222_patent is a one-piece looper_horn that curves over its entire_length
townsend amended its claim to make clear that its looper_horn 1 had first and second_end_portions 2 that the second_end_portion was substantially longer than the first_end_portion 3 that the second_end_portion was substantially straight and 4 that the second_end_portion was angularly disposed with respect to the first_end_portion
townsend is now precluded from contending that the accused device-which has none of the characteristics added by the amendments-is equivalent to the invention claimed in the853_patent

for this reason the district_court can not be faulted as townsend would do for failing to make the three-part analysis that defines the doctrine of equivalents
see supra p. 9

c. townsend makes a number of creative but unpersuasive arguments in support of its contention that there were factual_issues that precluded summary_judgment on the prosecution_history_estoppel issue

first townsend asserts that the hitec_horn like the horn disclosed in the853_patent consists of two pieces
townsend argues that it is theoretically possible to divide the hitec_horn into two` portions' based on the horns inner_diameter

as the district_court recognized however townsends attempt to divide the hitec looper_horn into two portions based on the horns inner_diameter ignores the basic structure of the hitec_horn
townsend_eng g 1 uspq2d at 1990
the district_court after viewing the hitec_horn correctly determined that
[ e ] ven if this court buys townsends statements that one section of the hitec_horn gradually becomes wider while a longer_portion is consistently of the same diameter that does not alter the nature of the auto_wienker as a single_piece of plastic_tubing
id
( footnotes omitted

townsend further asserts that the accused device like the device claimed in claim 5 of the853_patent contains a` second portion' that is` substantially straight'
in support of this contention townsend presents a number of illustrations of the accused and the patented_devices viewed from above
as the district_court correctly noted however` even a hula-hoop issubstantially straight when viewed from a point in its own plane'
id.at 1990_n._5
the district_court properly refused to adopt this artificial interpretation of the structure of the two devices

even assuming arguendo that the hitec_horn could be divided into two portions and that a small portion of the horn could be viewed as` substantially straight' townsends argument still is fatally flawed
even under townsends analysis the` substantially straight portion' of the hitec_horn does not have a length substantially longer than the horns other_portion
moreover even if the hitec_horn were viewed as consisting of two portions those portions are not` angularly disposed' but instead meet to form a continuous curve

contrary to townsends assertions therefore the accused device does not contain the limitations that were added to the patented_device to avoid the prior_art
the district_court properly determined that there were no genuine_issues of material_fact regarding infringement under the doctrine *1092 of equivalents and that hitec was entitled to judgment on the equivalents issue as a matter of law

conclusion
the judgment of the district_court granting hitecs motion for summary_judgment and dismissing the suit is affirmed
