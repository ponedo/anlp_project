background
flex-rest owns the489 and231_patent s which relate to computer keyboard positioning systems
the489_patent involves a clamping system that allows adjustment of the keyboard to a negative_tilt_position with the palm rest adjusted above the plane of the keys
the231_patent involves a tray system that positions the keyboard in a similar negative_tilt_position
a view of this system is shown in figure 7 of the489_patent reproduced below

*big_token__1355_fig._7__big_token
?
on april_17,_2002 flex-rest filed suit against steelcase office_details inc. and office_concepts inc. asserting infringement of both patents
steelcase stipulated that it was liable for office_details and the case was bifurcated against office_concepts
the claims against office_details and office_concepts were therefore dismissed and the case proceeded against steelcase alone

the claim terms at issue in this appeal were construed in a memorandum opinion and order of november 10 2003 following a hearing on claim_construction
at issue in the489_patent was a limitation related to keyboard position as highlighted in claim 1 below 1
a device for mounting a keyboard to a base and for positioning the keyboard in a backward_tilted_position.. the device comprises

* * * b a clamp engaged with said bracket said clamp being engagable with a keyboard such that the keyboard may be oriented in a backward_tilted_position defined by the rear end of the keyboard being disposed below the front end of the keyboard to prevent the keyboard from falling off when the keyboard is orientated in said backward_tilted_position ;..489_patent col._4,_ll._41-54
the district_court construed this language to mean that` the support device permits the bottom of a keyboard to be tilted backward i.e. at any angle of less than 0 degrees'
at issue in the231_patent was the` sidewall' limitation highlighted in claim 1 below 1
a device for mounting a keyboard to a base and for positioning the keyboard in a backward_tilted_position.. the device comprising

* * * c a support_tray comprising a support_surface and
a keyboard stop member comprising a stop wall said support_surface comprising a front portion a rear_portion a first_sidewall and a second_sidewall such that said stop wall extends from said first_side_wall to said second_side_wall and wherein said stop wall is disposed in said rear_portion of said support_surface..231_patent col._9,_ll._38-54
the district_court construed` sidewall' to mean` a structure projecting or extending upward i.e. above the plane of the support_surface from either side of the support_tray'
finding that steelcases products did not possess sidewalls that projected or extended upward the district_court granted steelcases motion for partial summary_judgment of non-infringement of the231_patent

after a hearing on various pretrial motions the district_court granted steelcases *1356 motion in limine to exclude certain portions of testimony by dr. john c. rosecrance flex-rests designated expert
specifically dr._rosecrance was allowed to testify to his field of expertise ergonomics but was precluded from testifying as an expert regarding designs of keyboard_support_systems and the prior_art at the time of the invention

as trial began on the489_patent steelcase stipulated that its accused devices infringed
in turn flex-rest stipulated that steelcases kbs_device was conceived and reduced to practice before flex-rests invention was conceived in november 1990 and that the kbs_device taught each limitation of the asserted claims
thus the primary issue for trial was whether the kbs_device anticipated the489_patent under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g or qualified as prior_art for obviousness purposes

with respect to the kbs_device flex-rest requested that the jury be instructed that in order to constitute prior_art under section 102 g the prior_inventor could not have suppressed or concealed the invention
the district_court found that there was not sufficient_evidence to support such an instruction and denied flex-rests request

during deliberations the jury requested clarification regarding what is considered` public' and` prior_art'
the district_court defined` public' as` information not restricted by confidentiality'
as to` prior_art' the court responded in answer to your question anything made or built in the united states by another person before the date of the claimed invention can be prior_art for purposes ofobviousness even if it is not publically [ sic ] available before the date of the claimed invention.. keep in mind that you should consider what i have just written together with all the other instructions that i gave you earlier
all the instructions are important and you should consider them as a whole
the jury returned a verdict for steelcase finding the489_patent invalid under both 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g and 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
flex-rest did not make a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol or move for a new trial

after entering judgment for steelcase the district_court considered steelcases motion for a determination of inequitable_conduct in procuring the489_patent
steelcase argued that flex-rest received-but failed to disclose to the u.s. patent and trademark_office the patent_office -a letter and photographs from a competitor that constituted prior_art material to patentability
steelcase also argued that flex-rest failed to disclose the kbs_device to the patent_office and that flex-rests patent_counsel made a false declaration in his petition to make special because he did not investigate the photographs or the kbs_device in his search of the prior_art
the court concluded that steelcase failed to show clear and convincing_evidence of an intent to deceive and therefore denied the motion

on appeal flex-rest challenges the district_courts jury_instructions the courts ruling limiting dr._rosecrances expert_testimony and the courts claim_construction of disputed terms in the489 and231_patent s. on cross-appeal steelcase challenges the district_courts finding that clear and convincing_evidence did not demonstrate inequitable_conduct in procuring the489_patent
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

jury instructions
the district_court found that flex-rest had failed to establish` a sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find.. that there was suppression or abandonment by steelcase in connection with *1358 the kbs [ device ]' under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g

relying on lutzker v. plet 843_f.2d_1364_(fed.cir.1988) and young v. dworkin 489_f.2d_1277_(c.c.p.a.1974) flex-rest argues that sufficient_evidence supports a prima_facie_case of suppression or concealment under section 102 g
flex-rest contends that steelcase intentionally kept the kbs_device a secret from the time of its reduction to practice in mid-november 1990 until its disclosure at a trade_show in june 1991 while making only modest improvements for commercialization purposes
flex-rest points to shindelar v. holdeman 628_f.2d_1337_(c.c.p.a.1980) for support that three months is a reasonable_time to draft and file a patent_application as opposed to the nearly seven months involved in drafting the application for the kbs_device
flex-rest adds that because the kbs_device was suppressed it was not prior_art for ¡± 103 purposes
moreover flex-rest asserts that the district_courts responses to the jurys questions compounded this error

steelcase responds that checkpoint systems inc. v. united states international trade commission 54_f.3d_756_(fed.cir.1995) and dow_chemical co. v. astro-valcour inc. 267_f.3d_1334_(fed.cir.2001) control and that suppression or concealment is negated as a matter of law by either the commercialization of the kbs_device or by the filing of a patent_application on may_31,_1991
alternatively steelcase argues that suppression or concealment is an equitable determination for the judge
steelcase adds that flex-rest failed to proffer a correct jury_instruction

we must first determine if there is disputed evidence of record supporting an instruction on suppression or concealment of the kbs_device
we conclude that there is none and agree with the district_court and steelcase that flex-rest did not make out a prima_facie_case of suppression

patent law provides that` [ a ] person shall be entitled to a patent unless-.. before such persons invention thereof the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned suppressed or concealed it'
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g 2 2004 ; dow_chemical 267 f.3d at 1339
if prior_invention has been established the burden shifts to the patentee to produce sufficient_evidence to create a genuine_issue of material_fact as to whether the prior_inventor abandoned suppressed or concealed the invention
dow_chemical 267 f.3d at 1339
there are two types of suppression or concealment cases in which the inventor intentionally suppresses or conceals his invention and cases in which a legal inference of suppression or concealment can be drawn based on an unreasonable delay in making the invention publicly known
id.at 1342 ; fujikawa 93 f.3d at 1567

flex-rest first argues that the kbs_device was intentionally suppressed or concealed
intentional_suppression occurs when an inventor` designedly and with the view of applying it indefinitely and exclusively for his own profit withholds his invention from the public'
paulik v. rizkalla 760_f.2d_1270 1273 fed.cir.1985 en banc quoting kendall v. winsor 62_u.s._322 328 21_how._322 16_l.ed._165_(1858) ; see also fujikawa 93 f.3d at 1567
the only evidence flex-rest offers for this argument is the time taken to file the patent_application for the kbs_device and the fact that the device was kept secret during that time
`` intentional_suppression however requires more than the passage of time
it requires evidence that the inventor intentionally delayed filing in order to prolong the period during which the invention is maintained in secret'
fujikawa 93 f.3d at 1567 *1359 emphasis added
the record demonstrates that after reduction to practice steelcase moved almost immediately towards both filing a patent_application and commercially disclosing the kbs_device at a trade_show actions which indicate an intent to make a public_disclosure
both the patent_application and commercialization_efforts came to fruition about six and one-half_months later
that the device was kept secret during this time is not by itself indicative of intentional_suppression or concealment
see e.i
du pont de nemours & co. v. phillips petroleum co. 849_f.2d_1430 1436_n._5_(fed.cir.1988)` because work issecret does not necessarily mean that it has beenabandoned suppressed or concealed
``
because flex-rest did not offer any evidence indicating a designed intent to withhold the kbs_device from the public we conclude that there is not sufficient_evidence to support a jury_instruction regarding intentional_suppression or concealment

flex-rest next argues that the delay in filing a patent_application for the kbs_device supports an inference of suppression or concealment
`` the failure to file a patent_application to describe the invention in a published document or to use the invention publicly within a reasonable_time after first making the invention may constitute abandonment suppression or concealment'
dow_chemical 267 f.3d at 1342 citations omitted ; see also checkpoint 54 f.3d at 761-62
there is no particular length of delay that is per se unreasonable checkpoint 54 f.3d at 761 and` [ m ] ere delay without more is not sufficient to establish suppression or concealment'
young 489 f.2d at 1281
`` [ e ] ach case involving the issue of suppression or concealment must be considered on its own particular set of facts'
paulik 760 f.2d at 1275 quoting shindelar 628 f.2d at 1343

our case law provides guidance on what constitutes a reasonable delay when an invention is disclosed to the public by commercializing the invention
in dow_chemical we held that a delay of two and one-half years between reduction to practice and the commercialization of an invention did not constitute a prima_facie_case of suppression or concealment where the first_inventor made` reasonable_efforts to bring the invention to market'
267 f.3d at 1343 quoting checkpoint 54 f.3d at 762
in that case the first_inventor` actively and continuously took steps towards [ ] commercialization.. including the procurement of financing to build a new production plant and [ ] attention to safety considerations'
id
we noted that the fastest route to commercialization was not required only reasonable_efforts
id
similarly in checkpoint we agreed with an administrative law judges determination that a delay of four years between reduction to practice and commercialization was reasonable when the first_inventor took steps to bring the invention to market such as disclosing it to his employer conducting further tests purchasing supplies from vendors and helping develop a system for mass production
54 f.3d at 762

in this case flex-rest offered no evidence to indicate that steelcases delay of six and one-half_months between reduction to practice and commercialization of the kbs_device was not the result of reasonable_steps to bring the invention to market
after reduction to practice steelcase resolved design issues and spent $ 775,000 on tooling for the parts to the kbs_device
the lead times for creating the tooling varied from four weeks to approximately six months
therefore it does not appear that steelcase could have brought the kbs_device to market much sooner than the trade_show unveiling in june 1991

*1360 at the same time steelcases patent_counsel began drafting a patent_application for the kbs_device submitting a first draft to steelcase in march 1991
the draft was reviewed by the four named inventors and filed in may 1991
no evidence indicated that this amount of time was unreasonably long.1

because flex-rest offered no evidence to demonstrate that steelcase failed to take reasonable_steps toward market and because flex-rest offered no evidence that a delay of six and one-half_months from reduction to practice to filing an application was unreasonable we conclude that there is not sufficient_evidence to support a jury_instruction regarding an inference of suppression or concealment

we disagree with flex-rests contention that lutzker and young command a different result
first both lutzker and young address disclosing a prior_invention only by filing a patent_application ; they do not address-as is the case here-disclosure through commercialization
in an interference context we have held that delayed filing due to commercialization_efforts or improvements not reflected in the patent_application are inexcusable
lutzker 843 f.2d at 1367 ; young 489 f.2d at 1281-82
however we have expressly distinguished lutzker and young from situations in which public_disclosure occurred by bringing the invention to market
see dow_chemical 267 f.3d at 1343 distinguishing lutzker and young from cases in which an invention is disclosed to the public by commercialization ; checkpoint 54 f.3d at 762 distinguishing lutzker because` [ h ] ere.. kaltners invention was brought to the public by marketing'
therefore the` reasonable_steps to market' identified in dow_chemical and checkpoint are applicable here

flex-rest had the burden to produce sufficient_evidence to create a genuine_issue of material_fact as to whether the kbs_device was suppressed or concealed
we conclude that no evidence of record supports such an instruction
we also conclude that the district_court fairly stated the legal_principles in answering the jurys questions on` public' and` prior_art' and did not commit prejudicial error

2
expert testimony
the district_court found that one skilled in the art of the invention was a keyboard designer
accordingly the court excluded testimony by dr._rosecrance on the issues of anticipation and obviousness finding that his area of expertise was in ergonomics rather than keyboard design support systems
flex-rest argues that the invention applies ergonomic principles to keyboard design and that dr._rosecrance is qualified in the ergonomics field

the district_court held a hearing to fully investigate dr._rosecrances qualifications to testify about designs of keyboard systems and prior_art
the court considered dr._rosecrances expertise in ergonomics but concluded that he was not one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention
there is no indication that the district_court abused its discretion in arriving at this conclusion

*1361 because the district_court did not err in instructing the jury or abuse its discretion in precluding dr._rosecrances testimony we affirm the jury_verdict finding the489_patent invalid

3
summary judgment of non-infringement
flex-rest challenges the district_courts construction of the` backward_tilted_position' language in claim 1 of the489_patent and the term` sidewall' in claim 1 of the231_patent
flex-rest however stipulated that the kbs_device taught each limitation of the489_patent and disputed only whether the kbs_device met the requirements of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g
because that stipulation was not limited to a specific construction and because we have affirmed the jurys invalidity finding there is no need to address the courts construction of the489_patent
our claim_construction inquiry is therefore limited to the term` sidewall' in the231_patent

the district_court construed the` sidewall' limitation to mean` a structure projecting or extending upward i.e. above the plane of the support_surface from either side of the support_tray'

flex-rest argues that` sidewall' does not include a directional_limitation and can therefore be met by a projection extending downwards
flex-rest characterizes the sidewall term as` minor'` inconsequential' and` unimportant' and asserts that there is no basis in the intrinsic record for importing a directional_limitation
steelcase counters that the specification and prosecution_history make clear that` sidewall' is part of the` support_surface' and can only serve its function if it extends upward from the` support_surface'

in determining the meaning of the disputed claim limitation we look principally to the intrinsic evidence of record examining the claim_language itself the written description and the prosecution_history if in evidence
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1312-17
here the language of claim 1 recites a support_surface` comprising a front position a rear position a first_sidewall and a second_sidewall such that the said stop walls extend from said first_side_wall to said second_side_wall'
'231_patent col._9,_ll._47-53
the sidewalls therefore form part of the support_surface
the written description mentions this structure only in describing figure 13 which depicts side walls 127_and_129 as extending above the support_surface to help keep the keyboard in place
id. col._5,_ll._26-52
the claim_language and the specification clearly indicate that` sidewalls' are elements of the support_surface
the written description makes clear that in order for a` sidewall' structure to support the keyboard it must extend upwardly ; if` sidewalls' extend downwardly they would not interact with or play any role in supporting the keyboard
indeed downwardly extending` sidewalls' would be entirely superfluous
such a requirement does not improperly read a limitation from the specification into the claim
rather the written description and the drawings make clear that when the claim refers to` sidewalls' of a support_surface the claim_language refers to upward-extending walls
phillips 415 f.3d at 1316`the construction that stays true to the claim_language and most naturally aligns with the patents description of the invention will be in the end the correct construction'
' citation omitted
the prosecution_history is consistent with this interpretation and provides no further guidance
flex-rests attempt to avoid the sidewall limitation by characterizing it as` inconsequential' disregards the basic patent law doctrine that every limitation of a claim is material
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 29 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997)` each element contained in a patent claim is deemed material *1362 to defining the scope of the patented invention..'
we therefore agree with the district_courts construction that` sidewalls' must extend upwardly

because there is no dispute that the accused devices do not meet the` sidewall' limitation under this construction summary_judgment of non-infringement of the231_patent was appropriate

4
inequitable conduct
steelcase challenges the district_courts inequitable_conduct ruling based on two of the three grounds argued below
first steelcase argues that steven fox flex-rests patent_counsel withheld prior_art by not disclosing to the patent_office a letter from a competitor which included photographs of a keyboard_support_system the ergo_photographs
steelcase argues that the ergo_photographs were highly material to patentability were not cumulative of information already disclosed and that flex-rests intent to deceive the patent_office can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances
second steelcase argues that fox made a false representation to the patent_office when he filed a declaration accompanying a petition to make special which stated he had` conducted a careful and thorough_search of the prior_art'
steelcase argues that this statement was false based on foxs failure to investigate the ergo_photographs

the district_court found that the ergo_photographs were` of uncertain_import and reliability' that fox was justified in concluding they were cumulative of a patent already disclosed to the patent_office and that the facts triggering a duty to investigate in brasseler u.s.a
i l.p. v. stryker sales corp. 267_f.3d_1370_(fed.cir.2001) were not present in this case
the court concluded that flex-rest failed to show clear and convincing_evidence that foxs failure to disclose the ergo_photographs was accompanied by an intent to mislead the patent_office
the district_court also found that clear and convincing_evidence did not demonstrate that foxs declaration was false
`` [ foxs ] failure to [ investigate the ergo_photographs ] under the circumstances does not mean that he did not conduct a careful and thorough_search of the prior_art'
inequitable_conduct_decision slip op.at 6
because` fox knew the ergo keyboard support represented a commercial embodiment of an invention already disclosed to the patent_office' the court concluded that foxs statement was not false regardless of how it appeared in hindsight after protracted litigation
id

steelcase argues that the district_court erred in finding that the ergo_photographs were of uncertain_import and reliability that fox concluded the photographs were cumulative and that brasseler is distinguishable
steelcase also argues that the district_court erred in finding that foxs declaration was not false because the photographs were not cumulative and fox was therefore not excused from investigating them further

flex-rest counters that the district_court was correct in its findings because the ergo_photographs were received more than five years from the priority_date for the231_patent and were not dated ; the photographs were described in the letter as an embodiment of u.s._patent_no._5041,770 the seiler_patent which fox disclosed in an information disclosure statement ids ; and fox believed the photographs were not` prior_art' subject to investigation

failing to disclose material information or submitting false material information or statements coupled with an intent to mislead or deceive the patent_office constitutes inequitable_conduct

*1363 inc. 438_f.3d_1123 1128 fed.cir.2006 ; kingsdown 863 f.2d at 872 ; 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 a 2004
materiality and intent must both be proven by clear and convincing_evidence
kingsdown 863 f.2d at 872
`` once threshold findings of materiality and intent are established the trial_court must weigh them to determine whether the equities warrant a conclusion that inequitable_conduct occurred'
purdue pharma 438 f.3d at 1128

the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying steelcases motion
the ergo_photographs are undated and identified in the letter as showing equipment that embodied the seiler_patent
the letter containing the ergo_photographs is dated may_14,_1996 ; fox submitted an ids that disclosed the seiler_patent on october 21 1996
in deposition fox stated that` the seiler_patent teaches anything and everything that may or may purportedly have been contained in those photographs'
to be sure some of the photographs plainly depict a keyboard with a negative tilt and thus foxs statement in his deposition seems at odds with his statement to the patent_office during prosecution of the489_patent that the seiler_patent contains` no teaching of positioning the keyboard in a negative_tilt_position..
it does not disclose or teach that the wrist rest may be moved to a position above a substantial portion of the keys of the keyboard'
however the main thrust of foxs deposition explanation for not disclosing or conducting a further investigation of the photographs was that in the context in which the photographs were presented to him he did not regard them as constituting credible_evidence of prior_art that was in existence as of the priority_date of the489_patent

steelcase was required to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that fox possessed an intent to deceive or mislead the patent_office
on this record we do not have a definite and firm_conviction that the court was mistaken in finding the photographs were` of uncertain_import and reliability' and that fox believed them to be` in the main cumulative'
we are further not persuaded that the court was mistaken in finding-in light of foxs testimony that the photographs were not credible and largely cumulative-that the facts were distinguishable from those in brasseler
the patent attorneys in brasseler had knowledge of a potential on-sale bar by their client had no rational basis to support their contention of when the sale had occurred and offered no credible_evidence or explanation for their failure to inquire about the sale before or after an application was filed
267 f.3d at 1381-82
the district_court found that the facts at issue here were distinguishable from the facts in brasseler and we do not perceive clear_error in that finding

as to foxs declaration fox stated in deposition that he considered the ergo_photographs not credible and cumulative of the seiler_patent he later disclosed in the submitted ids
we therefore do not believe that the district_court clearly erred in finding that foxs declaration was not false and not made with intent to mislead the patent_office

when materiality of information is close-as it appears to be here with the ergo_photographs-a patent applicant should err on the side of disclosure
see critikon 120 f.3d at 1257` it is axiomatic that [ c ] lose cases should be resolved by disclosure not unilaterally by the applicant
`` quoting labounty mfg. inc. v. u.s. int l trade comm n 958_f.2d_1066 1076 fed.cir.1992
`` a very deferential standard of review however governs inequitable_conduct determinations'
lnp eng g plastics inc. v. miller waste mills inc. 275_f.3d_1347 1361 fed.cir.2001
the district_court found that fox believed *1364 the ergo_photographs were cumulative of the seiler_patent and therefore lacked intent
because that finding was not clearly erroneous and because the court did not misapply or misinterpret applicable_law we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in denying steelcases motion for a determination of inequitable_conduct

iii
conclusion
because we find that the district_court properly instructed the jury and did not abuse its discretion in limiting dr._rosecrances testimony we affirm that the489_patent is invalid
because there is no genuine_issue of material_fact that the accused devices do not possess the` sidewall' limitation as properly construed we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment that the231_patent was not infringed
because the district_court did not abuse its discretion its order denying steelcases motion for a determination of inequitable_conduct is affirmed

affirmed
