opinion
pauline newman circuit_judge
the defendants in this declaratory_judgment_action met-coil_systems_corporation and its subsidiaries the lockformer_company and iowa_precision_industries appeal the decision of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of missouri.1 the court held all the claims of united states patent no._4466,641 the641_patent invalid for the patentees failure to disclose the best_mode as required by 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
the court also held that the patentee committed inequitable_conduct based on failure to disclose the best_mode and voided the agreement whereby engel_industries the declaratory judgment plaintiff had been licensed under the641_patent
the district_court also held that the641_patent had not been proved invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

we reverse the rulings of invalidity and inequitable_conduct
no cross-appeal was taken from the ruling that the patent was not invalid because of obviousness

background
the lockformer_company is a manufacturer of roll-forming machines that form segments of ducts that distribute air throughout a building ; iowa_precision_industries manufactures equipment for this industry
duct segments are made on roll-forming machines at or near the construction site and are connected before or during installation
according to the record before the invention described in the641_patent these connections required rivets or spot welds procedures that were time consuming and labor intensive

in 1981 howard mcelroy an engineer employed by iowa_precision began work on improving the connection of duct_sections
his goal was to enable duct_sections to be connected on site in a simple manner
mr. mcelroy asked the lockformer_company to quote the price of a roll-forming machine that would form duct segments having a particular form of integral_flange that mcelroy then had in mind
growing out of this exchange lockformer and iowa_precision which were not then sister companies decided to collaborate on this problem
early in this collaboration two meetings were held those present including mcelroy robert heilman lockformers vice president of engineering and leo_r._gale lockformers executive vice president and director of sales
these meetings were held on december 2 1981 and january 29 1982 and are pertinent to the issue of best_mode as we shall discuss

flowing from this collaboration messrs. heilman and mcelroy developed as joint inventors the system described and claimed in the641_patent
in this system the duct_sections are formed with an integral_flange configured so as to engage corner_connectors in such a way that the *1530 connectors are simply snapped into place
this snap-fit made unnecessary the previously used rivets and other labor-intensive connection methods
the ducts 10 with corner_connectors 34 are illustrated in fig._1 of the patent

?
-- -- - patent claims 1-big_token__6_and_13__big_token -19 are apparatus claims and claims 7-big_token__12_and_20__big_token -25 are method claims
claim 1 is representative of the apparatus claims 1
in a system for connecting the ends of sheet_metal_ducts wherein a frame is provided for each duct_end corner_connectors defining perpendicularly extending arms are associated with the frames and means are provided to interconnect the frames of adjacent_duct_ends the improvement wherein the sheet metal used for the ducts is also employed for forming said frames each said frame specifically comprising a roll-formed section consisting of an integral_part of a duct_wall each said section comprising a first_portion extending perpendicularly outwardly from a duct_wall and a second_portion bent rearwardly into a position opposite an end_portion of the duct_wall the distance between said second_portion and said end_portion substantially corresponding to the width of an arm of a corner_connector the side_edges of each such_arm being received in engagement with the respective_surfaces of a second_portion and end_portion whereby the corner_connectors are held in position relative to a frame and including retainer_means defined by said second_portion for receiving a side edge of an arm for thereby securely holding the arm in position
claim 7 is a typical method claim 7
in a method for connecting the ends of sheet_metal_ducts wherein a frame is *1531 provided for each duct_end corner_connectors defining perpendicularly extending arms are associated with the frames and means are provided to interconnect the frames of adjacent_duct_ends the improvement comprising the steps of forming each said frame by roll-forming a section of the duct whereby the frame comprises an integral_part of the sheet metal duct each said roll-formed section comprising a first_portion extending perpendicularly outwardly from a duct_wall and a second_portion bent rearwardly into a position opposite an end_portion of the duct_wall the distance between said second_portion and said end_portion substantially corresponding to the width of an arm of a corner_connector forming a retainer_means in said second_portion introducing the arms of the corner_connectors between respective second_portions and end_portions whereby the side_edges of each such_arm are received in engagement with the respective_surfaces of a said second_portion and end_portion to hold the corner_connectors in position relative to a frame said retainer_means assisting in the holding by said second_portion and thereafter fastening the respective connectors together to provide an assembly

engel_industries a manufacturer of roll-forming machines was a licensee under the641_patent
engel brought a declaratory_judgment_action against lockformer iowa_precision and their parent company met-coil collectively` met-coil' seeking a declaration of invalidity and non-infringement and refund of royalties paid

best mode-35 u.s.c.¡± 112
the district_court found that crimping the corner_connectors after they are snapped onto the ducts is the best_mode of carrying out the641 invention and that this was not disclosed in the641_patent
the district_court did not address particular claims or distinguish between apparatus and method but held all the claims invalid on this ground

35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 requires the specification shall contain a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains or with which it is most nearly connected to make and use the same and shall set forth the best_mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention
patent invalidity for failure to set forth the best_mode requires that 1 the inventors knew of a better_mode of carrying out the claimed invention than they disclosed in the specification and 2 the inventors concealed that better_mode

the best_mode inquiry is directed to what the applicant regards as the invention which in turn is measured by the claims
unclaimed subject matter is not subject to the disclosure requirements of ¡± 112 ; the reasons are pragmatic the disclosure would be boundless and the pitfalls endless
see *1532 randomex inc. v. scopus corp. 849_f.2d_585 588 7_uspq2d_1050 1053 fed.cir.1988` it is concealment of the best_mode of practicing the claimed invention that section 112 ?

this outline of precedent illustrates the fact-dependency of the question and reinforces the need to establish the element of concealment of the inventors preferred_mode before claims may be invalidated on the best_mode ground [ i ] n order to find that the best_mode_requirement is not satisfied it must be shown that the applicant knew of and concealed a better_mode than he disclosed
hybritech 802 f.2d at 1384-85 231 uspq at 94

the district_court found that the inventors did not disclose that the corners should be crimped to hold them securely in place
the court found that the inventors` knew that crimping might be necessary' at the time the patent_application was filed
in evidence was a memorandum written by leo_r._gale of lockformer dated february 3 1982 and reporting on the december 2 1981 and january 29 1982 meetings
the gale memorandum of which copies had been distributed to mcelroy and heilman included the statement 12
a closing tool may be required to install corner and clinch bend form to retain corner
gale testified at trial about this statement q had any testing been done at that time ?
a no none whatsoever
it was a supposition as an engineer which i am
q then is-are you telling me that it was some time in83 when people in the lockformer organizations first started to give attention to doing some actual crimping then ?
a to my knowledge
the evidence was generally undisputed that the inventors concept and their preferred_mode was to snap in the corners without the need for any other fastening step and to avoid the rivets or other procedures that were previously needed
gale testified` the machines properly set up will hold the corners very nicely
in fact manually they are practically impossible to take out'
while the fact was disputed of how tightly the corners held without crimping that was not the issue
gales suggestion at or after a conference with the inventors that crimping` may be required' is not clear and convincing_evidence of either 1 the inventors belief that crimping was the preferred_mode of carrying out the claimed invention or 2 concealment of the preferred_mode

there was testimony that after the system was commercialized problems arose in the handling and transportation to the job_site of duct_sections to which corners had been connected and that crimping of the corners avoided these problems
the first customer to purchase the met-coil roll-forming machine testified by handling [ the duct section ] and putting it on a truck and letting it drive 20 30 miles to a project vibrations-this *1533 sort of thing-the corners would eventually work out
so we could send the corners loose
we started doing that ; having them put-put them in the field and we did n't have to crimp them
but we did different times crimp them in the shop if it was close by
there was testimony that met-coils customers practical experience was that about twenty percent of the corners if the corners were attached before transportation to the job_site separated during transport or rough handling
in printed instructions issued in 1983 some nine months after the641_patent_application was filed lockformer showed a crimping step and sold tools for this purpose
the unrebutted evidence shows however that this step or precaution was not part of the claimed invention but was taken to facilitate transport and handling
disclosure was not required by ¡± 112 ; just as there is no requirement for example to disclose the preferred packing material in which to ship the invention
the district_court found that crimping is` necessary'` essential' and` very important'
these findings do not relate to the time the patent_application was filed and are clearly erroneous with respect to the claimed invention

compliance with the best_mode_requirement of ¡± 112 is governed by the inventors state of mind with respect to the invention that is described and claimed in the patent_application
there was no evidence that the inventors believed at the time of filing their patent_application that crimping was the preferred_mode of carrying out the claimed invention
the undisputed evidence shows that at the time of application their preferred_mode was simply to snap in the corners without crimping

the district_court did not find concealment ; nor does any evidence support such a finding
the inclusion in lockformers sales literature of the crimping step after the benefit in handling and transportation was manifest also weighs against concealment
since neither knowledge that there was a better_mode nor concealment of that mode was established the holding of invalidity for failure to comply with the best_mode_requirement is clearly in error and must be reversed

enablement
engel states as an alternative_ground for upholding the judgment of invalidity that` the failure to disclose crimping renders the met-coil patent invalid for lack of enablement'
engel argues that since the corners are not securely held unless crimped the claimed invention is not enabled

the enablement_requirement is separate from that of the best_mode and must be separately met
chemcast 913 f.2d at 926 16 uspq2d at 1035
the enablement_requirement is met if the description enables any mode of making and using the claimed invention
see id.at 929 16 uspq2d at 1037 contrasting the best_mode and enablement_requirements
it was not shown that the641 invention as claimed was not enabled by the description in the specification and the district_court did not so find
invalidity can not be sustained on this ground

inequitable conduct
a
a holding of inequitable_conduct requires inter alia proof of intent to deceive or mislead kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988 en banc cert
denied 490_u.s._1067 109_s.ct._2068 104_l.ed.2d_633_(1989) and does not flow simply from failure to meet the requirements of patentability
culpable conduct is required such as intentional concealment of the best_mode under the mask of a fictitious mode as in consolidated aluminum corp. v. foseco int l ltd. 910_f.2d_804 809 15_uspq2d_1481 1484 fed.cir.1990
no finding of culpable conduct was here made or could be supported by the evidence

in view of our holding that the best_mode_requirement was not violated the holding of inequitable_conduct based thereon must be reversed

b. engel asserts non-disclosure of material prior art as an alternative_ground for *1534 sustaining the holding of inequitable_conduct
the dw/141_reference was the subject of a request for reexamination filed by met-coil in 1987 after engel challenged validity of the641_patent on the ground that the dw/141_reference was invalidating prior art under ¡± 103
the patent examiner rejected the request for reexamination holding that the dw/141 publication is merely cumulative to similar prior art already fully considered in previous examination of the claims
when a reference is cumulative to other prior art that was before the examiner the element of materiality is not established and inequitable_conduct can not lie

c. as an additional alternative_ground for affirming the holding of inequitable_conduct engel argues that met-coil should have disclosed to the patent and trademark office the need for crimping during prosecution of the641_patent_application or at least with the request for reexamination
engel argues that this disclosure was required even if met-coil did not learn of the advantages of crimping until after the patent_application was filed
this position is contrary to law for disclosure is closed when the patent_application is filed
there is no opportunity for an inventor to include subsequent improvements or modifications in an application or patent after filing
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 132 prohibiting addition of` new matter'
thus there can be no obligation to do so and no penalty for failure to do so

post-argument motions
the motions to consider additional portions of the trial record are granted

costs
costs are taxed in favor of met-coil

reversed
