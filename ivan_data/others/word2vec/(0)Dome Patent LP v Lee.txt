opinion
hughes circuit_judge
dome owns a patent for making contact-lens_material
on reexamination the u.s._patent and trademark_office found that the claimed method at issue was obvious and therefore unpatentable
the district_court agreed with the patent_office that *1375 the claimed method was unpatentable
on appeal dome challenges both the standard of review employed by the district_court and the courts ultimate_conclusion on obviousness
because we conclude that the district_court applied the proper legal standard and because its factual_findings were not clearly erroneous we affirm

i. dome owns u.s._patent no._4306,042 which concerns the polymer_science behind making contact-lens_materials that are rigid and gas permeable
during the relevant_time_period contact-lens_makers required contact-lens_materials to be optically clear sufficiently rigid for machining and polishing oxygen permeable and hydrophilic
to meet these four requirements contact-lens_makers used plastic polymers

a polymer is a chain or network of molecules called monomers
the process of synthesizing a polymer from monomers of a single type is called polymerization
when two or more different types of monomers are reacted i.e. copolymerized a copolymer is formed and the constituent compounds are known as comonomers
polymers or copolymers can have many different structures including linear chains branched chains cross-linked networks and mixtures thereof

contact-lens_makers can produce materials that have varying physical_properties by varying the types of monomers used and the resulting polymers structure
for example using one type of cross-linking agent over another may increase the gaps in a polymers structure affecting oxygen_permeability
or using hydrophilic_monomers sometimes referred to as` wetting agents' in a linear polymer chain can increase the polymers ability to attract or hold water
by contrast using hydrophobic monomers to create a polymer can decrease the polymers affinity for water

the first practical plastic contact_lens was made of plexiglass or polymethyl methacrylate pmma
although clear rigid and hydrophilic pmma was not sufficiently oxygen permeable to allow users to wear the lenses for extended periods of time
after a few hours a user had to remove pmma_lenses to allow the cornea to absorb ambient oxygen which is needed to ensure among other_things that the eyes cells and nerves remain healthy
given these limitations on pmma_lenses polymer_scientists began exploring other combinations of monomer types and polymer structures to create a material similar to pmma but with increased oxygen_permeability

in the early 1970s major advances in polymer_science led to the discovery that silicone could be incorporated into plastics by mixing siloxane-based compounds with methyl methacrylate mma a monomer in pmma
one particular siloxane-based compound known as` tris' or 1 1 1-tris trimethylsiloxy methacryloxypropylsilane was identified as a strong candidate because when mixed with mma it led to materials with exceptional oxygen_permeability
a significant drawback to this combination however was that tris is hydrophobic and it caused the polymer to be hydrophobic
to offset this drawback polymer_scientists in the late 1970s and the 1980s would combine other hydrophilic comonomers wetting agents and cross-linking agents with tris hoping to strike an acceptable balance between oxygen_permeability optical clarity rigidity and hydrophilicity

claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent covers a method of making one such combination
*1376 the method comprises making tris and then copolymerizing it with an ester of acrylic or methacrylic_acid e.g. mma a surface wetting agent and an oxygen permeable siloxane-based cross-linking agent a multifunctional1 siloxanyl alkyl ester
claim 1 recites in relevant part

a method of making an oxygen permeable material for the manufacture of contact_lens by the synthesization of the monomer 1 1 1-tris methylsiloxy methacryloxypropylsilane
( a siloxanyl alkyl ester by the following procedures.. f forming an oxygen permeable contact_lens_material by copolymerizing from 5 % to 90 % by weight of the 1 1 1-tris trimethylsiloxy methacryloxypropylsilane prepared above ; 3 % to 90 % by weight of an ester of acrylic or methacrylic_acid ; from 0.05 % to 90 % by weight of a surface wetting agent from 0.01 % to 90 % by weight of an oxygen permeable crosslinking agent selected from the class of multifunctional siloxanyl alkyl esters in the presence of a free radical or a photo initiator
¡¬042_patent col. 5_ll._38 -64
in december 1997 dome filed suit against six makers of contact_lenses for alleged infringement of the ¡¬042_patent
shortly after one defendant requested ex parte_reexamination of the ¡¬042_patent
see35_u.s.c.¡± 302 1994
in june 1999 the patent_office ordered reexamination and as a result the district_court stayed litigation pending a final_determination in the reexamination proceeding
the patent_office confirmed the patentability of claims 2 3 and 4 of the ¡¬042_patent but it found claim 1 obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 2006

dome then filed suit in september 2007 against the patent_office in the united_states_district_court for the district of columbia under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 145_and_306_(2006) requesting that the district_court enjoin the patent_office from cancelling claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent and that it direct the patent_office to issue a reexamination certificate under 35 u.s.c.¡± 307 2006
following a bench trial the district_court held claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and entered judgment in favor of the patent_office

the district_court concluded that the ¡¬042_patent would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill at the time of filing in view of the prior_art including u.s._patent nos._4120,570 gaylord 4,152,508 ellis and 4,235,985 tanaka

gaylord discloses a polymer for making rigid gas-permeable contact_lenses
gaylords disclosures represent a significant breakthrough in contact-lens_materials
it is one of the first teachings of using siloxane-based monomers including tris with mma for the purpose of making contact_lenses
in fact the record indicates that tris and similar siloxane-based compounds became an` industry standard' in the manufacture of contact_lenses following this breakthrough
j.a.2085

gaylord teaches that a suitable polymer can be made by combining tris mma methacrylic_acid as a hydrophilic_wetting_agent and a hydrophilic cross-linking agent such as ethylene_glycol dimethacrylate
*1377see gaylord_col. 1 l.53-col. 2 l.44 ; col. 3_ll._63 -65 ; col. 5_ll._39 -51 ; col. 6_ll._3 -12
but unlike the ¡¬042_patent gaylord does not teach using a hydrophobic siloxane-based cross-linking agent
see gaylord_col. 6_ll._3 -12

ellis discloses a` silicone-containing hard contact_lens_material' that like gaylord can include tris mma a hydrophilic_wetting_agent and a hydrophilic cross-linking agent including ethylene_glycol dimethacrylate
ellis_col. 1_ll._1 -3 ; col. 3_ll._7 -24 ; col. 3_ll._64 -68 ; col. 4_ll._24 -27 ; col. 4_ll._4 -7
ellis also teaches the inclusion of a fifth monomer called an itaconate ester which` gives increased rigidity hardness and some degree of wettability'
ellis_col. 2_ll._1 -3

tanaka discloses a polymer suitable for continuous-wear contact_lenses and it teaches using a variety of cross-linking agents
like gaylord and ellis tanaka teaches using a hydrophilic compound including ethylene_glycol dimethacrylate as a cross-linking agent
tanaka_col. 8_ll._2 -6
but tanaka also teaches among other_things that using hydrophobic_siloxane-based compounds are preferably employed as cross-linking agents because of their ability to enhance oxygen_permeability in the resulting polymer
tanaka_col. 8_ll._10 -46

tanaka differs from gaylord in that rather than using tris tanaka teaches using a different siloxane-based monomer containing both hydrophobic alkylsiloxy ester groups siloxane-based groups and internal hydrophilic glycerol or polyether groups
see tanaka_col. 2 l.64-col. 3 l.5
tanaka teaches that this replacement for tris-type_monomers can be combined with mma
see tanaka_col. 2 l.64-col. 3 l.5 ; col. 7 ll.39-41
according to tanaka this approach is more effective than using tris-type_monomers because simply offsetting the hydrophobic properties of tris by copolymerizing it with hydrophilic_monomers can lead to an` opaque' product` a fatal_defect for use as contact_lens_materials
therefore the polymerization ratio of the hydrophilic_monomer to the [ tris-type ] monomer is limited to produce a transparent copolymer..' tanaka_col. 3_ll._35 -40 ; see also tanaka_col. 3_ll._6 -34
tanaka suggests that alternatively one might reduce the number of siloxane-based molecules in the polymer to reduce hydrophobicity but then the oxygen_permeability of the resulting polymer becomes too low
tanaka_col. 3_ll._41 -45
tanaka explains that` [ i ] n any case there can not be obtained a polymer suited for preparing a contact_lens which can be comfortably worn continuously for a long_period of time' when tris-type_monomers are employed
tanaka_col. 3_ll._48 -51

in the district_court_action dome did not dispute that the prior_art disclosed the compounds recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent
the district_court found that a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine the prior_art and that the prior_art did not teach away from the claimed invention notwithstanding the disclosures in tanaka regarding tris-type_monomers
additionally the court found that domes proffered evidence of objective_indicia did not indicate nonobviousness
accordingly the court agreed with the boards conclusion that claim 1 is unpatentable as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
dome appeals
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 4 c

ii
before reaching domes appeal of the obviousness_conclusion we first address domes allegation that the district *1378 court erred by only requiring the patent_office to show that claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent is obvious by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by clear and convincing_evidence
we conclude that the district_court correctly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard

domes appeal arises from an ex parte_reexamination of the ¡¬042_patent
ordinarily the patent_office in such a proceeding must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the reexamined_claims are not patentable
rambus inc. v. rea 731_f.3d_1248 1255 fed.cir.2013
if an ex parte_reexamination results in the claims being rejected as unpatentable the decision can be appealed directly to this court
see35_u.s.c.¡± 141

alternatively for ex parte_reexaminations filed before november 29 1999 a complaint can be filed in district_court against the patent_office
see37 c.f.r.¡± 1.303 a 2012 ; 35 u.s.c.¡± 145` the [ district ] court may adjudge that such applicant is entitled to receive a patent for his invention.. and such adjudication shall authorize the director to issue such patent..'
`` the thrust of such a complaint is that the decision of the board is erroneous on the facts the law or both
indeed the boards decision is the jurisdictional base for the suit.. [ i ] t is in essence a suit to set aside the final_decision of the board'
fregeau v. mossinghoff 776_f.2d_1034 1036-37 fed.cir.1985

accordingly if the patent_office decides after an ex parte_reexamination that a preponderance of the evidence establishes the claimed subject_matter is not patentable ¡± 145 authorizes the district_court to review whether that final_decision is correct
the ¡± 145 action in such a case does not concern the different question of whether as part of a defense to an infringement action clear and convincing_evidence establishes that an issued and asserted patent should be held invalid
see id.at 1037` it can not seriously be contended that a ¡± 145 action is other than one to overturn the boards decision'

citing 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 and microsoft corp. v. i4i ltd. partnership -- -u.s. -- -- 131_s.ct._2238 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011) dome argues that the district_court erred by refusing to hold the patent_office to the clear and convincing_evidence_standard of proof
according to dome the presumption of validity in ¡± 282 applies to its claimed invention because the district_court_action concerns a claim that the patent_office previously allowed to be patented
accordingly dome argues the supreme_courts holding that` ¡± 282 requires an invalidity defense to be proved by clear and convincing_evidence' 131 s.ct.at 2242 also applies in domes ¡± 145 action

the ¡± 145 action before the district_court did not involve a defense to a charge of infringement of an issued patent
section 282 therefore does not apply in this instance
see35_u.s.c.¡± 282
the district_court here was reviewing the patent_offices reexamination of claimed subject_matter and its final_determination that the subject_matter is not patentable to ascertain whether dome was entitled to receive a patent
only if the district_court found in favor of dome would the patent_office be authorized to issue a patent
see35_u.s.c.¡± 145
and only after the patent issued would it be entitled to the presumption of validity under ¡± 282 and consequently could not be held invalid absent clear and convincing_evidence

the clear and convincing_evidence_standard in the litigation context *1379` stems from our suggestion that the party challenging a patent in courtbears the added burden of overcoming the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have done its job
`` sciele pharma inc. v. lupin ltd. 684_f.3d_1253 1260 fed.cir.2012 quoting pharmastem therapeutics inc. v. viacell inc. 491_f.3d_1342 1366 fed.cir.2007
but` [ i ] n reexamination proceedings a preponderance of the evidence must show nonpatentability before the [ patent_office ] may reject the claims of a patent application
`` rambus 731 f.3d at 1255 quoting ethicon inc. v. quigg 849_f.2d_1422 1427 fed.cir.1988
this standard is` substantially lower than in a civil case.. [ and ] there is no presumption of validity'
in re swanson 540_f.3d_1368 1377 fed.cir.2008 citations omitted

`` [ a ] n examiner is not attacking the validity of a patent but is conducting a subjective examination of claims in the light of prior_art'
in re_etter 756_f.2d_852 857-58 fed.cir.1985 ; see also id.at 857` litigation and reexamination are distinct proceedings with distinct parties purposes procedures and outcomes'
when the patent_office institutes ex parte_reexamination it reopens prosecution to determine whether the claimed subject_matter should have been allowed in the first place
at that point there is no need to presume that the patent_office had` done its job' in the previous examination
accordingly the presumption of validity is no longer applicable

our conclusion aligns with the purpose of the reexamination process which includes allowing the patent_office to take a second look at` patents thoughtdoubtful
`` in re_etter 756 f.2d at 857 quoting h.r.rep
no._66-1307 at 3-4 1980 reprinted in 1980_u.s.c.c.a.n._6460 6462
`` in a very real sense the intent underlying reexamination is tostart over` in the patent_office
id
we would hinder this intent if we required the district_court here to presume that the reexamined_claim is valid because of the patent_offices previous determination and consequently to impose a burden to defend its own subsequent reexamination decision by clear and convincing_evidence
thus the district_court did not err by requiring the patent_office to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the reexamined_claim is obvious

iii
we now address the district_courts obviousness determinations
a patent may not issue` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art
`` 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 20062 obviousness is a question of law based on underlying factual_findings including` 1 the scope and content of prior_art ; 2 differences between prior_art and claims ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 objective_indicia of nonobviousness'
par pharm. inc. v. twi pharm. inc. 773_f.3d_1186 1193 fed.cir.2014 citing graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
we review the ultimate_conclusion of obviousness de novo and the underlying *1380 factual_findings for clear error
medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 437_f.3d_1157 1164 fed.cir.2006

a
if all elements of a claim are found in the prior_art as is the case here the factfinder must further consider the factual questions of whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would be motivated to combine those references and whether in making that combination a person of ordinary_skill would have had a reasonable_expectation of success
id.at 1164
the supreme_court has cautioned however that an obviousness determination can not be confined by formalistic rules
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 419 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
rather courts must take an` expansive and flexible approach' to the question of obviousness
id.at 415 127_s.ct._1727

evidence of a motivation to combine prior_art references may flow from`the nature of the problem to be solved
`` tokai corp. v. easton enters. inc. 632_f.3d_1358 1371 fed.cir.2011 quoting ruiz v. a.b
chance co. 357_f.3d_1270 1276 fed.cir.2004
here the record supports the district_courts finding that a person of ordinary_skill understood that high_oxygen_permeability in contact-lens_materials was desirable
and this understanding would have motivated a person of ordinary_skill to combine the tris monomer disclosed in gaylord with the tris-type cross-linking agent disclosed in tanaka to increase the oxygen_permeability of a contact_lens

gaylord for example teaches that the previously used contact-lens_material pmma is rigid and durable but relatively impermeable to oxygen
gaylord_col. 1_ll._24 -30
gaylord explained it would be` highly desirable' to provide a contact-lens_material that has` increased oxygen_permeability is wettable' and has improved mechanical properties
gaylord_col. 1_ll._39 -44
to meet that need gaylord discloses using siloxane-based compounds including tris-type_monomers
see gaylord_col. 1_ll._44 -51 ; col. 2_ll._32 -44
similarly ellis teaches that oxygen_permeability is` directly related' to the silicone_content in contact_lenses
ellis_col. 1_ll._29 -30
and tanaka explains that contact_lenses with poor oxygen_permeability would make it` impossible to wear them continuously for a long_period of time'
tanaka_col. 1_ll._30 -32
tanaka therefore` preferably employed' siloxane-based cross-linking agents including some that are hydrophobic because the oxygen permeabilities of the obtained cross-linked copolymers are high
tanaka_col. 8_ll._10 -46

the testimonies from domes experts also support the district_courts conclusion
dr. mark melamed testified that` its essential that there be an adequate flow of oxygen either through the lens or around the lens'
j.a
1805 ; see also j.a
1804-05` its essential that there be a constant flow of oxygen to the entry surface of the cornea in order for a contact_lens to be worn safely for a period of time'
a` chief' issue during dr. melameds practice was` the ability to get oxygen across a contact_lens' while` maintaining a nice even tear film over the contact_lens and over the cornea' i.e. hydrophilicity was considered a` secondary problem' related to contact_lens comfort levels
j.a
1807
and another of domes experts dr. timothy long testified that those in the field were turning to siloxane-based compounds to enhance a polymers oxygen_permeability
*1381see j.a
1746` it has great oxygen_permeability
its one of the big driving forces for people in the contact_lens field to use it`
accordingly the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the evidence disclosed a motivation to combine the prior_art

b. dome argues that a person of ordinary_skill would not have been motivated to combine gaylord with tanaka because the prior_art teaches away from using tris with siloxane-based cross-linking agents
to improve gay-lords disclosures dome asserts a person of ordinary_skill would have been inclined to introduce hydrophilic cross-linking agents instead of hydrophobic_siloxane-based cross-linking agents to offset the hydrophobicity of tris but tanaka warned against this approach
as an alternative tanaka suggested designing a new amphiphilic or hydrophilic_monomer to replace tris altogether

`` [ w ] hen the prior_art teaches away from combining certain known elements discovery of a successful means of combining them is more likely to be nonobvious'
ksr 550 u.s. at 416 127_s.ct._1727
a reference teaches away from a claimed invention when a person of ordinary_skill` upon reading the reference would be discouraged from following the path set out in the reference or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by the applicant'
in re gurley 27_f.3d_551 553 fed.cir.1994
but` [ t ] he degree of teaching away will of course depend on the particular facts'
id
; see also id
(` a known or obvious composition does not become patentable simply because it has been described as somewhat inferior to some other product for the same use`
and` there is no rule that a single reference that teaches away will mandate a finding of nonobviousness'
medichem 437 f.3d at 1165 ; see also ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727` rigid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense.. are neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it`
additionally just because` better alternatives' may exist in the prior_art` does not mean that an inferior combination is inapt for obviousness purposes'
in re mouttet 686_f.3d_1322 1334 fed.cir.2012 citing gurley 27 f.3d at 553

here tanaka discloses potential disadvantages associated with using tris-type_monomers
it explains that outside of certain unspecified limits if hydrophilic_monomers are copolymerized with hydrophobic_tris-type_monomers to offset hydrophobicity the copolymer` is liable to become opaque'
tanaka_col. 3_ll._6 -36
tanaka explains that opacity is a` fatal_defect' for the copolymers use as a material for contact_lenses and thus offsetting hydrophobic_tris-type_monomers with hydrophilic_monomers` is limited'
tanaka_col. 3_ll._36 -41
tanaka does not further identify the mentioned limits but it goes on to disclose an alternative for tris-type_monomers
see tanaka_col. 3_ll._52 -59

the record however supports the district_courts finding that other prior_art references disclose roadmaps on how to offset the disadvantages associated with using tris-type_monomers to obtain a material suitable for contact_lenses

ellis acknowledges that` [ i ] t has been difficult to obtain high_oxygen_permeability while still maintaining other properties.. when oxygen_permeability is derived from the silicone_content' in a polymer
ellis *1382 col. 1_ll._30 -34
ellis then teaches how to effectively overcome this difficulty without compromising the resulting materials clarity
ellis teaches several examples of using tris with hydrophilic_monomers in varying concentrations and concludes that` [ i ] n all cases the polymers are optically clear and meet required standards of contact_lenses'
ellis_col.big_token__7_ll._15__big_token -17 ; see also id
col. 5 l.50-col. 7l.13 ; id
col. 7_ll._19 -21
ellis also discloses that` many variations are possible within the scope of keeping the physical_properties' stating that` [ f ] or example two or more siloxanyl alkyl ester monomers can be used instead of a single such monomer for that component of the system'
ellis_col. 7_ll._30 -36

gaylord similarly acknowledges the issues identified by tanaka and then sets out a solution one that does not compromise the resulting polymers use as a material for contact_lenses
gaylord teaches that` [ w ] hile some of the copolymers are inherently wettable by human tears it may be necessary to improve the wettability of others'
gaylord_col. 5_ll._39 -41
for example` wettability can be imparted to the copolymer by the addition of from about 0.1 % to about 10 % by weight of one or more hydrophilic_monomers to the copolymerization mixture' or by other treatments including corona discharge oxidizing or soaking in aqueous solutions
id
col. 5_ll._42 -58
gaylord also lists examples` illustrat [ ing ] the preparation and properties of copolymers containing varying proportions of a siloxanyl monomer [ mma ] and a hydrophilic_monomer hydroxyethyl methacrylate'
gaylord_col. 9 l.67-col. 10 l.2
many of these examples resulted in` transparent' materials
see ellis_col. 9 l.66-col. 10 l.24

the district_court found that while tanaka warns that constructing a lens with tris-type materials can be difficult the other two references plainly teach that tris could be used effectively to make contact_lenses
accordingly the district_court concluded that a person of ordinary_skill would not have been dissuaded from combining the prior_art particularly in light of gaylord and ellis
the record supports these factual_findings

while domes argument that the claimed subject_matter would not have been obvious in light of tanakas disclosures is plausible` [ t ] he burden of overcoming the district_courts factual_findings is as it should be a heavy one'
polaroid corp. v. eastman kodak co. 789_f.2d_1556 1559 fed.cir.1986
our standard of review requires that we uphold the district_courts factual_findings on this point rather than revisiting them de novo
in this case the district_court did not clearly err in finding a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine the identified prior_art to arrive at the claimed invention notwithstanding tanakas disclosures regarding tris-type compounds

c. dome also challenges the district_courts handling of evidence relating to objective_indicia of nonobviousness
dome argues first that the district_court erred by improperly shifting the burden onto dome to prove nonobvious-ness once the patent_office established a prima_facie_case of obviousness

while we have held that a district_court has erred` by making its finding that the patents in suit were obvious before it considered the objective considerations and by shifting the burden of persuasion to [ the patentee ]' in re cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsule patent *1383 litig. 676_f.3d_1063 1075 fed.cir.2012 the legal framework used by the district_court in this case was not improper

before reaching its ultimate_conclusion of obviousness the district_court first considered whether the patent_office had demonstrated that a person of ordinary_skill would have been motivated to combine the compounds recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent and that there would have been a reasonable_expectation of success
the court also considered whether the prior_art taught away from the claimed invention
after finding in favor of the patent_office on these points the court agreed with dome that a product the boston_iv_contact_lens embodies claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent and that the boston_iv_contact_lens achieved some commercial_success
nevertheless the court found that the evidence relating to the boston_iv_contact_lens was not particularly strong
next after considering the parties arguments and making the relevant findings of fact the court concluded that claim 1 of the ¡¬042_patent is obvious as a matter of law
indeed the courts opinion when read as a whole shows that the court considered and made factual_findings on all evidence relating to objective_indicia before reaching its ultimate_conclusion on obviousness

dome also argues that the district_court erred by refusing to consider domes proffer of evidence relating to objective_indicia of nonobviousness
we have consistently stated that` all evidence pertaining to the objective_indicia of nonobviousness must be considered before reaching an obviousness_conclusion'
plantronics inc. v. aliph inc. 724_f.3d_1343 1355 fed.cir.2013
the district_court here did not refuse to consider domes evidence
rather the court found that dome was entitled to a presumption that the commercial_success of the boston_iv_contact_lens relates to the claimed invention
nonetheless the court found that the evidence was` not particularly strong'
j.a
57
the court also gave` little weight' to testimony relating to the reasons for the boston_iv_contact_lenss commercial_success
j.a
6_n._4
moreover the court found that domes own expert testified that the commercial_success of the boston_iv_contact_lens was in part due to other economic and commercial factors not related to the allegedly novel aspects of the claimed invention
dome does not challenge these findings

after having accepted all evidence relating to the four graham factors-including evidence relating to commercial_success-the district weighed the evidence and then made findings of fact
only after considering all of the evidence did the court reach its obviousness_conclusion
thus we conclude that the court did not err in its consideration of the evidence relating to objective_indicia of nonobviousness

iv
we have considered domes remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive
because the district_court did not commit reversible error in its determination that the claimed subject_matter would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill during the relevant_time_period we affirm

affirmed
