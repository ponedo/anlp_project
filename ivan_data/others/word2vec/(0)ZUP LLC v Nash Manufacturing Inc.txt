*1368 appellant zup llc` zup' appeals the decision of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of virginia which granted summary_judgment in favor of appellee nash_manufacturing inc.` nash'
the district_court invalidated claims 1_and_9 of u.s._patent_no._8292,681` the681_patent` as obvious and in the alternative held that nash does not infringe claim 9
we affirm the district_courts holding that claims 1_and_9 are invalid as obvious and do not reach the infringement question

i. zup and nash are competitors in the water_recreational_device_industry
nash has been a part of the industry for over fifty years and has designed and manufactured water skis knee boards wake boards and other similar recreational devices
meanwhile zup is a relative newcomer to the industry having entered the market in 2012 with its` zup_board'
the zup_board is designed to assist riders who have difficulty pulling themselves up out of the water into a standing_position while being towed behind a motorboat

a. zup owns the681_patent which includes twelve claims
generally the claims of the681_patent cover a water_recreational_board and a method of riding such a board in which a rider simultaneously uses side-by-side_handles and side-by-side_foot_bindings to help maneuver between various riding positions
according to the patent this allows a rider to more readily move from lying prone to kneeling to crouching and then to standing

claims 1_and_9 of the681_patent are at issue in this case
claim 1 states 1
a water_recreation_device_comprising a riding_board having a top_surface a bottom_surface a front_section a middle_section and a rear_section ; a tow_hook disposed on the front_section of the riding_board ; first and second_handles disposed side-by-side on the front_section of the top_surface of the riding_board_aft of the tow_hook ; first and second_foot_bindings disposed side-by-side on the middle_section of the top_surface of the riding_board_aft of the first and second_handles ; and
a plurality of rails protruding from the bottom_surface of the riding_board and extending substantially the full_length of the riding_board ; wherein the tow_hook includes a rearward-facing concave_section sized to receive a tow_rope_bar and positioned to allow the riding_board to be pulled in a forward_direction by a tow_rope attached to the tow_rope_bar *1369 wherein the first and second_handles and the first and second_foot_bindings are configured for simultaneous_engagement by a rider to position the rider in a crouching stance facing in a forward_direction wherein the plurality of rails are disposed relative to a longitudinal_axis along the bottom_surface of the riding_board the longitudinal_axis projecting rearwardly from a reference_location substantially central to the front_section and each of the plurality of rails is laterally spaced closer to the longitudinal_axis nearest the rear_section of the riding_board than the each of the plurality of rails is laterally spaced from the longitudinal_axis nearest the front_section of the riding_board thereby allowing the water that moves across the bottom_surface nearest the front_section of the riding_board to funnel towards the bottom_surface nearest the rear_section of the riding_board for the purpose of generating lift_force against the bottom_surface of the riding_board
'681_patent claim 1
likewise claim 9 states 9
a method of riding a water_recreation_device on a body of water comprising placing a water_recreation_device into a body of water the water_recreation_device_comprising a riding_board having a top_surface a bottom_surface a front_section a middle_section and a rear_section ; a tow_hook disposed on the front_section of the riding_board ; first and second_handles disposed side-by-side on the front_section of the top_surface of the riding_board_aft of the tow_hook ; and
first and second_foot_bindings disposed side-by-side on the middle_section of the top_surface of the riding_board_aft of the first and second_handles ; attaching a tow_rope to said tow_hook said tow_rope also attached to a water vehicle ; grasping the first and second_handles of the water_recreation_device to establish a prone_start_position by a rider ; maintaining said prone_start_position by the rider until the riding_board has achieved a substantially parallel position relative to the surface of the water ; achieving a kneeling_position by the rider by placing both knees on the top_surface of the riding_board ; achieving a crouching position by the rider by placing a first_foot into the first_foot binding and then placing a second_foot into the second_foot binding ; grasping the tow_rope by the rider by releasing the first and second_handles ; removing the tow_rope from the tow_hook by the rider ; standing on the riding_board by the rider while continuing to grasp the tow_rope
'681_patent claim 9

in sum claims 1_and_9 contain the following elements 1 a riding_board ; 2 a tow_hook on the front of the riding_board ; 3 a plurality of rails on the bottom_surface of the riding_board ; 4 side-by-side *1370 handles on the front of the riding_board ; 5 side-by-side_foot_bindings on the middle of the riding_board ; and at least as stated in claim 1 6 the ability to simultaneously engage the handles and foot_bindings to position the rider in a crouching stance

b
in 2013 zup and nash began discussions about a potential joint manufacturing venture for the zup_board
their negotiations eventually fell through and nash brought the accused product the` versa_board' to market in may 2014

like the zup_board the versa_board has a tow_hook on the front_section of the board
unlike the zup_board however the versa_board has several holes on the top_surface of the board that allow users to attach handles or foot_bindings in various configurations
see j.a
427-29
although nash warns against having the handles attached to the board while standing see j.a
430 ? ?
22-23 a user could theoretically ignore nashs warnings and attach the handles and foot_bindings in a configuration that mirrors the configuration of the zup_board see j.a
139

after seeing the versa_board displayed at a surf expo in 2014 glen duff zups chief innovative officer and inventor of the681_patent approached keith_parten nashs president to express concern that the versa_board infringed the681_patent
after another failed attempt to secure a partnership with nash zup turned to litigation

in its complaint zup alleged 1 contributory_infringement of the681_patent ; 2 induced infringement of the681_patent ; 3 trade secret misappropriation under the virginia uniform trade secrets act ; and 4 breach of contract
nash counterclaimed seeking declaratory relief as to non-infringement and invalidity

the district_court granted nashs summary_judgment_motion with respect to invalidity thus rendering the infringement claims moot
specifically the district_court held claim 1 obvious over u.s._patent_no._5163,860` clark' in view of u.s._patent_no._6306,000` parten000' ; u.s. patent no._7530,872` parten872' ; u.s._patent_no._5979,351` fleischman' ; u.s._patent_no._5797,779` stewart' ; and u.s._patent_no._6585,549` fryar'
zup llc v. nash mfg. inc. 229_f.supp.3d_430 446 e.d
va. 2017
the district_court also held claim 9 obvious over clark in view of parten000 stewart and u.s. patent no._4678,444` monreal'
id.at 447

although the district_court recognized that its invalidity decision rendered zups contributory and induced infringement claims moot id.at 450 it nonetheless conducted an alternative analysis stating that it would have granted nashs summary_judgment_motion with respect to non-infringement of claim 9 id.at 450-55
finally the district_court granted summary_judgment in nashs favor with respect to the non-patent_claims

in particular where` the content of the prior_art the scope of the patent_claim and the level of ordinary_skill in the art are not in material dispute and the obviousness of the claim is apparent in light of these factors summary_judgment is appropriate'

a
the primary issue in this case is whether claims 1_and_9 of the681_patent are invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a1 although the` ultimate judgment of obviousness is a legal_determination' ksr 550 u.s. at 427 127_s.ct._1727 it is based on underlying factual inquiries including 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claims and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art ; and 4 any secondary_considerations of non-obviousness
graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
likewise whether one of skill in the art would have had a motivation to combine pieces of prior_art in the way claimed by the patent is also a factual determination
intercont l great brands 869 f.3d at 1343

here there appears to be no dispute with respect to the content of the prior_art or the differences between the prior_art and the681_patent
and the parties agree that the relevant level of skill in the art is` a person with at least 3-5 years experience in the design and manufacture of water_recreational_devices or [ who has ] a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering'
zup 229 f.supp.3d at 438 ; appellants br
13
the only issues raised on appeal pertain to 1 whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the prior_art_references in the way claimed in the681_patent and 2 whether the district_court properly evaluated zups evidence of secondary_considerations

1
a` motivation to combine may be found explicitly or implicitly in market forces ; design incentives ; theinterrelated teachings of multiple patents ;any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent ; and the background knowledge creativity and common_sense of the person of ordinary_skill'

cir
2009 quoting ksr 550 u.s. at 418-21 127_s.ct._1727

the district_court first found that all the elements of the claimed invention existed *1372 in the prior_art
specifically the district_court pointed to earlier patents on water_recreational_boards that included the same elements used in the681_patent a riding_board a tow_hook handles foot_bindings and a plurality of rails on the bottom_surface of the riding_board
zup 229 f.supp.3d at 446-47
from this the district_court explained that the681_patent` identifie [ s ] known elements in the prior_art that aided in rider_stability while engaging a water_recreational_device and simply combined them in one apparatus and method'
id.at 447
the district_court then concluded that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the various_elements from the prior_art_references noting that such motivation would have stemmed from a desire` to aid in rider_stability to allow a wide_variety of users to enjoy the device and to aid users in maneuvering between positions on a water_board' -all motivations that were` a driving force throughout the prior_art and have been shared by many_inventors in the water_recreational_device_industry'
id

the record_evidence supports the district_courts analysis
although zup contends that a person of skill in the art would have been focused on achieving rider_stability in a predetermined riding position the evidence contradicts this assertion
helping riders switch between riding positions had long been a goal of the prior_art
see clark at 1:25-34 describing the difficulty of maneuvering from a prone_position to a kneeling_position and lessening this difficulty by eliminating the need for the rider to hold the tow_rope while moving to a kneeling_position ; id.at 1:40-45` as the towing speed_increases the user may either remain prone pull himself into a kneeling_position or rise to a standing_position without worrying about holding the tow_rope
`` ; see also partenbig_token__000_at_2__big_token53-54 describing a rider changing from prone to kneeling to sitting to standing ; partenbig_token__872_at_3__big_token52-58` the present invention.. increases the likelihood that a young weak or otherwise inexperienced rider of the aquatic_recreational_device will achieve proper body positioning on the aquatic_recreational_device`
and the only evidence zup points us to is the testimony of its expert noting the` general_frustration to the industry that there was no product that would enable the weakest and most athletically challenged members of the boating community to ski or wakeboard'
reply_br

414 ?

the prior_art accomplished this goal of helping riders maneuver between positions by focusing on rider_stability
indeed zup even admits that achieving rider_stability is an` age-old motivation in this field'
appellants br
22
such stability was enhanced in the prior_art through the same components employed in the681_patent tow_hooks handles foot_bindings and other similar features
see fleischman at 2:45-46 describing handles that` allow the riders to hang on while being towed' ; id.at_fig._1 depicting side-by-side_handles on the front_section of a water sled ; u.s._patent_no._5083,955` echols' at 1:39-40 describing` a pair of stirrups for the riders feet' ; id.at_fig._1 depicting foot_bindings ; clark at 2:30-34 describing how a rider may hold a leash attached to the riding_board to aid in rider_stability ; stewart at 2:57-63 describing a` palm grip which provides a rider handhold' to increase stability

in the face of the significant evidence presented by nash regarding the consistent desire for riders to change positions while riding water_recreational_boards and the need to maintain stability *1373 while doing so and given that the elements of the681_patent were used in the prior_art for this very purpose there is no genuine_dispute as to the existence of a motivation to combine.2

2
zups second argument on appeal relates to the district_courts analysis of zups evidence of secondary_considerations
secondary considerations` help inoculate the obviousness_analysis against hindsight'
mintz v. dietz & watson inc. 679_f.3d_1372 1378 fed
cir
2012 ; see also graham 383 u.s. at 36 86_s.ct._684
as explained below however zups minimal evidence of secondary_considerations does not create a genuine_dispute of fact sufficient to withstand summary_judgment on the question of obviousness

zup contends that the district_court improperly shifted the burden to prove non-obviousness to zup stating that` the district_court could not possibly find an absence of material_fact when nash-the challenger with the burden of proof-introduced no evidence [ as to secondary_considerations ] and zup submitted two affidavits demonstrating secondary_considerations'
reply_br
5 ; see also appellants br
23-25

any concerns regarding improper burden allocation can be quickly dismissed
our precedent is clear that` the burden of persuasion remains with the challenger during litigation because every issued patent is entitled to a presumption of validity'

labs. ltd. 719_f.3d_1346 1353 fed
cir
2013
while this burden of persuasion remains with the challenger a patentee bears the burden of production with respect to evidence of secondary_considerations of nonobviousness
id
here the district_court adhered to our precedent in analyzing the evidence presented
although zup takes issue with the courts statement that` zup has failed to establish either that a long-felt but unresolved_need existed in the water_recreational_device_industry or that its product somehow solved any such need' see appellants br
23-24 quoting zup 229 f.supp.3d at 449 the district_court was merely referring to the burden of production with respect to such_evidence see e.g. zup 229 f.supp.3d at 449 finding` that zup has provided no evidence apart from conclusory statements made by its expert that any long-felt but unresolved_need existed in the industry' ;` that zup has failed to provide any evidence that others in the industry attempted and failed to make a board with stabilizing features' ; and that` zup has provided no evidence that nash attempted to independently create the device described in the681_patent and failed' ; see also prometheus labs. inc. v. roxane labs. inc. 805_f.3d_1092 1102 fed
cir
2015 rejecting the same argument based on similar language in a district_court opinion where we were persuaded that the district_court had merely been referring to the patent owners burden of *1374 production
it is clear that the district_court kept the ultimate burden of persuasion on the patent challenger throughout the obviousness_analysis
any argument that the district_court improperly shifted the burden is therefore without merit

zups argument also suggests that summary_judgment could not be granted based on the record_evidence
this argument is similarly unavailing

obviousness is ultimately a legal_determination and a strong_showing of obviousness may stand` even in the face of considerable evidence of secondary_considerations'

before the district_court zup presented evidence of three secondary_considerations long-felt but unresolved_need ; copying ; and commercial_success
on appeal zup focuses only on long-felt but unresolved_need and copying
see appellants br
24-25
accordingly we do not address any evidence of commercial_success

with respect to long-felt but unresolved_need zup proffered testimony from its expert james emmons stating that` [ f ] or over 50 years advances in the water-sports market focused on creating stability for a rider strictly within one of the three segments tubing knee-boarding or skiing/wakeboarding' and that` it was a general_frustration to the industry that there was no product that would enable the weakest and most athletically challenged members of the boating community to ski or wakeboard'
appellants br

zup contends that it then corroborated this testimony with nashs` enthusiastic acceptance' of the zup_board pointing to a statement by nashs president mr._parten.3 appellants br

j.a
139 ?

in zups view mr._partens positive response to the zup_board demonstrates the existence of a long-felt but unresolved_need for a water_recreation_device that eases the process of achieving a standing_position

as we have said before` [ w ] here the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention are as minimal as they are here however it can not be said that any long-felt need was unsolved'

that is true here where the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art are minimal
moreover the record_evidence indicates that the claimed invention was not the first to achieve the goal of helping users maneuver between positions on a water_recreational_board
see id
( noting that the alleged unresolved_need had been met by prior_art devices ; see also clark at 1:25-34 describing the *1375 difficulty of maneuvering from a prone_position to a kneeling_position and lessening this difficulty by eliminating the need for the rider to hold the tow_rope while moving to a kneeling_position ; id.at 1:40-45` as the towing speed_increases the user may either remain prone pull himself into a kneeling_position or rise to a standing_position without worrying about holding the tow_rope

but the evidence zup points us to suggests that for nashs versa_board to resemble the claimed invention a user would need to ignore nashs instructions on how to use the versa_board-instructions that specifically discourage users from keeping the handles attached to the board while standing
see appellants br
25 emphasizing the district_courts statement that` it is feasible for a user to ignore [ nashs ] instructions and attach both the handles and the foot_bindings in a configuration that is nearly identical to the zup_board' ; see also j.a
139

in sum we agree with the district_courts assessment of the summary_judgment record
even drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of zup such_evidence is insufficient to withstand summary_judgment on the question of obviousness
the weak_evidence of secondary_considerations presented here simply can not overcome the strong_showing of obviousness

``

we have considered zups remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive
as such we hold that summary_judgment as to obviousness is appropriate on this record

b. zup also appeals the district_courts alternative holding that nash does not infringe claim 9 of the681_patent
because this court affirms the district_courts holding of invalidity we do not address the district_courts alternative holding as to non-infringement

the681_patent in its abstract describes the zup_board as
having advantages such as improved stability maneuverability and ease of use
embodiments of the contemplated water_recreation_device include a riding_board handles and a tow_hook assembly that are configured to allow a rider to more easily transition to a standing forward-facing position while riding the device

a plurality of rails protruding from the bottom_surface of the riding_board and extending substantially the full_length of the riding_board ; wherein the tow_hook includes a rearward-facing concave_section sized to receive a tow_rope_bar and positioned to allow the riding_board to be pulled in a forward_direction by a tow_rope attached to the tow_rope_bar *1379 wherein the first and second_handles and the first and second_foot_bindings are configured for simultaneous_engagement by a rider to position the rider in a crouching stance facing in a forward_direction wherein the plurality of rails are disposed relative to a longitudinal_axis along the bottom_surface of the riding_board the longitudinal_axis projecting rearwardly from a reference_location substantially central to the front_section and each of the plurality of rails is laterally spaced closer to the longitudinal_axis nearest the rear_section of the riding_board than the each of the plurality of rails is laterally spaced from the longitudinal_axis nearest the front_section of the riding_board thereby allowing the water that moves across the bottom_surface nearest the front_section of the riding_board to funnel towards the bottom_surface nearest the rear_section of the riding_board for the purpose of generating lift_force against the bottom_surface of the riding_board
the parties the district_court and my colleagues all agree that the structure and the placement of handles and foot_bindings is novel
however the district_court and my colleagues hold that because some prior_art wakeboards have handles and some have foot supports nothing more is needed for summary_judgment of obviousness
the district_court stated it is evident to the court that duff identified known elements in the prior_art that aided in rider_stability while engaging a water_recreational_device and simply combined them in one apparatus and method
the elements in claim 1_and_9 are used for the exact same purpose as they were in the prior_art and as expected lead to the anticipated success of assisting riders in reaching a standing_position

the criteria for summary_judgment of obviousness are not met as i next discuss

the district_courts judgment
summary judgment of patent_invalidity requires that all reasonable factual allegations are resolved in favor of the non-movant teleflex inc. v. ficosa n. am corp. 299_f.3d_1313 1323 fed
cir
2002 citing anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986) and that when so resolved there is clear and convincing_evidence that the patented invention would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill
microsoft corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship 564_u.s._91 95 131_s.ct._2238 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011)
the district_court strayed from these long-recognized rules

although the prior_art is close the novelty of the681_patents wakeboard is not disputed
on the issue of obviousness my colleagues apply an incorrect analysis of the standard factual considerations as set forth in graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
the four graham_factors are 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the claims and the prior_art ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention ; and 4 objective considerations of obviousness
id.at 17-18 86_s.ct._684 ; see also ksr_int l_co. v. teleflex_inc. 550_u.s._398 399 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) reaffirming the four graham_factors

*1380 my colleagues hold that only three of the four graham_factors are considered in order to establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness and that the fourth_graham_factor is applied only in rebuttal whereby the fourth_factor must be of sufficient weight to outweigh and thereby rebut the first three factors
maj. op.at 1375
however as stated in apple_inc. v. samsung electronics co. 839_f.3d_1034 1048 fed
cir
2016 en banc` determination of whether a patent_claim is invalid as obvious under ¡± 103 requires consideration of all four graham_factors and it is error to reach a conclusion of obviousness until all those factors are considered'
the court in graham explored the interaction among the four factors and explained how each may affect judicial understanding of the others
the court recognized that the fourth_factor the objective_indicia are` more susceptible of judicial treatment than are the highly technical facts often present in patent litigation' and that such indicia` may lend a helping hand to the judiciary'
graham 383 u.s. at 35-36 86_s.ct._684
in stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1539 fed
cir
1983 this court observed that the` so-called secondary_considerations.. may often be the most probative and cogent evidence in the record' for they place the invention in the context in which it arose and aid judges in understanding obviousness of the invention as perceived by persons in the relevant_field

a ruling of invalidity on the ground of obviousness requires more than that the claim elements were previously known
as the court instructs in ksr

[ a ] patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was independently known in the prior_art
although common_sense directs one to look with care at a patent application that claims as innovation the combination of two known devices according to their established functions it can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary_skill in the relevant_field to combine the elements in the way the claimed new invention does

id.at 418-19 127_s.ct._1727
however my colleagues apply the flawed reasoning against which ksr warned and hold that the concededly novel zup_board would have been` prima_facie obvious' 2 because it uses known components ; my colleagues relegate to rebuttal the evidence of long-felt need failure of others copying and commercial_success and conclude that` [ t ] he weak_evidence of secondary_considerations presented here simply can not overcome the strong_showing of obviousness'
maj. op.at 1375

the requirement that the secondary_considerations` overcome' the conclusion based on the first three factors is incorrect for the obviousness_determination *1381 must be based on the invention as a whole including the evidence of all four graham_factors
it is incorrect to convert the fourth_graham_factor into` rebuttal' requiring it to outweigh the other three factors
consideration of the objective_indicia` is not just a cumulative or confirmatory part of the obviousness calculus but constitutes independent evidence of nonobviousness'

this evidence must be considered together with the other evidence and not separated out and required to outweigh or rebut the other factors
all of the factors must be considered in connection with proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence

the fourth_graham_factor is of particular analytic value in guarding against judicial_hindsight
the majoritys decision is a textbook example of hindsight where the inventors teaching is used as a template to render the invention obvious
precedent warns against this fallacy see e.g. ksr 550 u.s. at 421 127_s.ct._1727` a factfinder should be aware of course of the distortion caused by hindsight_bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning
`` ; polaris industries inc. v. arctic cat inc. 882_f.3d_1056 1068 fed
cir
2018` we have observed that the prejudice of hindsight_bias often overlooks that the genius of invention is often a combination of known elements which in hindsight seems preordained'

cir
2004` [ w ] e are mindful of the repeated warnings of the supreme court and this court as to the danger of hindsight_bias`
the district_court and the panel_majority do not identify any suggestion in the prior_art to make the specific wakeboard modifications made by duff-the only source of these modifications is judicial_hindsight

my colleagues also err in their analysis of the objective_indicia
for example the panel_majority concedes that nash obtained the patented wakeboard and used it to develop a wakeboard that` resembled the claimed invention'
maj. op.at 1375
yet the panel_majority holds that because zup did not give nash a` blueprint' of the zup_board the evidence of copying is somehow diminished
id.at 1375
no precedent no logic requires a` blueprint' in order to copy a simple structure in plain view and possessed by the accused infringer

the district_court also misapplied the factor of long-felt need
the court reasoned that since improvement in wakeboards was known to be desirable this sufficed to provide the motivation to make the improvement achieved by duff
dist
ct. op.at 447
motivation to solve a known problem is not motivation to make a specific solution as the district_court erroneously equated additionally the court finds that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated in 2008 to combine these elements in order to aid in rider_stability to allow a wide_variety of users to enjoy the device and to aid users in maneuvering between positions on a water_board
these motivations are a driving force throughout the prior_art and have been shared by many_inventors in the *1382 water_recreational_device_industry
and the specific desire to aid users in maneuvering between positions on a water_board has been a consistent motivation in the prior_art for decades
dist
ct. op.at 447 internal citations omitted
the panel_majority adopts this reasoning although neither my colleagues nor the district_court find that duffs novel combination was suggested in the prior_art as the path to long-sought improvement
to the contrary duffs realignment of known elements in a crowded field achieving benefits not previously achieved weighs against obviousness

the sport of wakeboarding has long challenged inexperienced and weak riders
the prior_art has long sought improvement yet no one presented the specific structure created by duff
and i repeat the words of nashs ceo himself an inventor of water sports products that` you have a great_product by the way !'

on the proper analysis summary_judgment of obviousness was improperly granted
see surowitz v. hilton hotels corp. 383_u.s._363 373 86_s.ct._845 15_l.ed.2d_807_(1966)` the basic purpose of the federal rules is to administer justice through fair trials not through summary dismissals as necessary as they may be on occasion`
on consideration of all of the graham_factors applied to the invention as a whole clear and convincing_evidence of obviousness was not presented
from my colleagues contrary ruling i respectfully dissent

the patent_examiner bears the initial burden of establishing obviousness
a prima_facie_case of obviousness is established when the examiner articulates nonconclusory explicit reasons for obviousness that are rationally supported by the factual record
