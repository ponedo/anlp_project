sept._25,_2007` summary_judgment_order'
because the trial_court erred by 1 construing claims 4-6 of the ¡¬622_patent to include the track and roller configuration limitation recited in claims 1-3 and 2 misapplying wine_railway appliance co. v. enterprise railway equipment 297_u.s._387 56_s.ct._528 80_l.ed._736_(1936) with respect to damages we vacate and remand

background
dsw owns the ¡¬622_patent which teaches a system and method for storing and displaying a large_stock of footwear for customer_self-service
dsw also owns the ¡¬172_patent which claims an ornamental design for a combined product display and stacked product container separator
on may_19,_2006 dsw notified shoe_pavilion that the then-current shoe display design` first_design' in five of its stores infringed dsws ¡¬622 and ¡¬172_patent s. shoe_pavilion responded to the notice and agreed to modify its first_design to avoid infringement
within seven months of dsws notification of infringement shoe_pavilion removed all first_design displays from its stores and replaced them with a modified design` new_design'

on october 27 2006 dsw filed suit against shoe_pavilion for patent_infringement alleging that shoe_pavilions manufacture and use of its new_design_footwear_displays in seven of its california stores also infringed claims 4-6 of the ¡¬622_patent and that shoe_pavilion owed damages for infringement of the ¡¬172 and ¡¬622_patent s by the first_design
shoe_pavilion moved for summary_judgment that its new_design_footwear_displays did not infringe or in the alternative that the ¡¬622_patent is invalid and that it owed no damages for infringement by the first_design

with respect to infringement by the new_design the parties dispute turned on whether the language in claims 4-61 of the *1345 ¡¬622_patent encompasses only methods of displaying and storing_footwear that contain track and roller mechanisms connecting display_modules to a support base as described in claims 1-32 the` track and roller_limitation'
dsw argued that the trial_court erred by impermissibly construing claims 4-6 to contain the track and roller_limitation notwithstanding the conspicuous absence of claim_language evincing such a limitation
shoe_pavilion argued that dsw disclaimed from the scope of the ¡¬622_patent any apparatus method or system that does not include a track and roller mechanism in the display module
first the original applications *1346 independent_claims which did not include the track and roller_limitation were rejected as reading on the prior_art or as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a and were cancelled
second the applications dependent claims already containing inter alia the track and roller_limitation were objected to for relying on the rejected independent_claims and were only approved after being amended to read as independent_claims
these amended claims issued as independent_claims 1-3 of the ¡¬622_patent
dsw simultaneously added new application claims 15-21 which issued as claims 4-10 of the ¡¬622_patent

relying on the specification and the prosecution_history the trial_court agreed with shoe_pavilion that method_claims 4-6 were not independent and separately patentable from claims 1-3
specifically it found that 1 the examiners reasons for allowance indicated that the track and roller_limitation was the seminal feature distinguishing the ¡¬622_patent over the prior_art 2 claims 4-6 would be invalid as indefinite without the limitation and 3 the specification describes the invention as a modular footwear_display and storage system and claims 1-3 recite a footwear_display and stack divider_module connected by a module_support_member containing the track and roller_limitation
the court also noted that the preferred_embodiment explicitly includes the track and roller_limitation
accordingly the court construed claims 4-6 to include a footwear_display module with vertically disposed horizontally moveable dividers coextensive with the track and roller_limitation described in claims 1-3 and concluded that because shoe_pavilions new_design lacked the rolling connection element it did not infringe the ¡¬622_patent
it granted summary_judgment of non-infringement in favor of shoe_pavilion

with respect to damages the district_court found that dsw was not entitled to any damages as a matter of law because immediately upon receipt of dsws notice of infringement of the ¡¬172 and ¡¬622_patent s by the first_design shoe_pavilion took reasonable_steps and timely removed all of the infringing shoe displays
citing wine_railway the trial_court granted summary_judgment to shoe_pavilion and stated that no damages for infringement are recoverable by a plaintiff unless the infringing_activity continues after notice is provided to the infringer

dsw appeals the trial_courts summary_judgment_order with respect to shoe_pavilions infringement of the ¡¬622_patent by the new_design and liability for damages for infringement by the first_design
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
we review the trial_courts grant of summary_judgment of non-infringement de novo
netscape commc'ns corp. v. konrad 295_f.3d_1315 1319 fed.cir.2002
summary judgment is appropriate` if the pleadings the discovery and disclosure materials on file and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 c
we address each of dsws challenges in turn

a. non-infringement
infringement occurs when a properly construed claim of an issued patent covers an accused device
see markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 976 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 374 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
claim construction is reviewed de novo on appeal
cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454 fed.cir.1998 en banc

*1347 the district_court erroneously imported the track and roller_limitation directly recited in claims 1-3 into the generally phrased` vertically disposed horizontally movably positionable_stack_divider' language of claims 4-6
first absent contravening evidence from the specification or prosecution_history plain and unambiguous claim_language controls the construction analysis
northern telecom ltd. v. samsung elecs co. 215_f.3d_1281 1295 fed.cir.2000` the plain and ordinary meaning of claim_language controls unless that meaning renders the claim unclear or is overcome by a special definition that appears in the intrinsic record with reasonable clarity and precision'
( citation omitted ; see also intervet am. inc. v. kee-vet labs. inc. 887_f.2d_1050 1053 fed.cir.1989` [ t ] his court has consistently adhered to the proposition that courts can not alter what the patentee has chosen to claim as his invention that limitations appearing in the specification will not be read into claims and that interpreting what is meant by a word in a claimis not to be confused with adding an extraneous limitation appearing in the specification which is improper
`` quoting e.i
du pont de nemours & co. v. phillips petroleum co. 849_f.2d_1430 1433 fed.cir.1988
on its face the` horizontally movably positionable_stack_divider' disputed language in claims 4-6 means that the vertically disposed stack_dividers must be capable of being moved into different_horizontal_positions in the footwear_display
although broad this claim_language is not ambiguous
we therefore disagree with the trial_courts decision to intermingle its validity and construction analyses and as a result read into claims 4-6 the track and roller_limitation of claims 1-3
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1327 fed.cir.2005 en banc` [ w ] e have limited the maxim [ of construing a claim to preserve its validity ] to cases in whichthe court concludes after applying all the available tools of claim construction that the claim is still ambiguous
`` quoting liebel-flarsheim co. v. medrad inc. 358_f.3d_898 911 fed.cir.20043

second as the trial_court acknowledged nowhere does the prosecution_history show an express disclaimer by dsw over a method of displaying footwear not involving the track and roller_limitation
to the contrary the examiner allowed claims 4-6 without objection concluding that the prior_art does not teach or suggest a method of displaying at least two footwear styles using the particular stacking of containers and stack_dividers recited in independent claim 15 issued as claim 4
in contrast when the examiner allowed amended claims 2 6 and 9 issued as claims 1-3 she explained that the prior_art does not teach or suggest a footwear_display and stack divider containing the track and roller_limitation
neither the claim_language nor the language of the examiners statement of reasons for allowance indicate that the display_method recited in claims 4-6 is constrained by the track and roller_limitation
see markman 52 f.3d at 980` although the prosecution_history can and should be used to understand the language used in the claims it too can notenlarge diminish or vary the limitations in the claims'
( citations omitted
the trial_court incorrectly inferred that the word` also' from the examiners statement that` [ t ] he prior_art also does not teach.. a method of displaying 1st and 2nd_footwear_styles' implied that the latter-discussed method_claims depended on the previously-discussed *1348 apparatus_claims
indeed the examiners specific reference to claim 15 issued as claim 4 as` independent' directly refutes such a presumption

third although the preferred_embodiment includes a rolling track mechanism the alternate embodiments include hooks lips and peg holes to permit the stack_dividers to have horizontally movable positions
moreover when claim_language is broader than the preferred_embodiment it is well-settled that claims are not to be confined to that embodiment
e.g. phillips 415 f.3d at 1323` [ a ] lthough the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments
``

in sum the trial_court did not construe or clarify the meaning of actual words in claims 4-6 but improperly read into them a new limitation not required by the claim_language specification or prosecution_history
because claims 4-6 are unambiguous contain limitations other than the disputed claim_term and are directed to a method for using an apparatus not to its structure or assembly it was improper for the trial_court to import limitations from the apparatus and system claims into the method_claims

shoe_pavilion concedes that its new_design includes storage and display of vertically stacked boxes of footwear separated by vertically disposed dividers that may be selectively positioned through use of a clip on a track
on remand the trial_court should compare the properly construed ¡¬622_patent claims to the new_design to determine whether it infringes

b
damages
the district_court misapplied the standard expressed by the supreme court in wine_railway which held that under the predecessor statute to the notice provision of 35 u.s.c.¡± 287 a patentee who failed to mark his patented article with the appropriate patent number could only recover damages for infringement occurring after actual_notice was provided the infringer
wine ry. 297 u.s. at 393-94 56_s.ct._528
this court has applied wine_railway in the current context of section 287
tex
digital sys. inc. v. telegenix inc. 308_f.3d_1193 1219 fed.cir.2002
the purpose of the notice requirement is to provide` protection against deception by unmarked patented articles'
wine ry. 297 u.s. at 398 56_s.ct._528
the idea is to prevent innocent infringement
motorola inc. v. united states 729_f.2d_765 772 fed.cir.1984

wine_railway provides no support for the trial_courts summary_judgment on damages
the issue here is whether shoe_pavilion is liable for damages to dsw for infringement occurring subsequent to receipt of actual_notice and wine_railway flatly states that a patentee may indeed recover damages for infringement that continues after actual_notice is provided
wine ry. 297 u.s. at 393-94 56_s.ct._528
without a doubt the law offers an infringer no exception to liability for the time it takes to terminate infringing activities no matter how expeditious and reasonable its efforts
see in re seagate tech. inc. 497_f.3d_1360 1368 fed.cir.2007 en banc` because patent_infringement is a strict liability offense the nature of the offense is only relevant in determining whether enhanced damages are warranted`
the trial_court therefore erred in concluding that shoe_pavilions reasonable_steps and good_faith_efforts to bring its infringing_activity to a timely_end equated to an immediate cessation
thus if the patents at issue are valid damages are owed on the design for the 6-7 months of continued infringement while shoe_pavilion phased out use of the displays in its stores

*1349 conclusion
accordingly the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion
