opinion
rich circuit_judge
this appeal is from the district court for the western_district of washington
this suit for patent infringement was tried to a jury and by agreement of the parties presided over by a magistrate
defendants peter k. musland norsol inc. and wink corporation appeal from the judgment entered on the jurys verdict holding them liable for infringing roger_sjolunds sjolund u.s. patent no._4221,071071 on an improved_crab_trap awarding damages and enjoining defendants from further_acts of infringement
we reverse the judgment because we conclude that the magistrate erred in denying defendants motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov that the claims in suit are invalid for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

background
the claimed_invention
the071_patent defines three improvements on a conventional_king_crab_trap
the first improvement is intended to prevent crabs from escaping a trap once having entered it
crab fisherman found that as a trap became crowded with crabs piled one on top of the other many crabs were able to leave the trap by crawling up a side face of the entrance_tunnel to the upper_surface of the tunnel and from there out through the entrance_frame and out the tunnel to the ocean_floor
sjolunds solution to this problem was to add triangular baffles in the upper corners of the trap extending from the upper_surfaces of the entrance_tunnels to the top face of the trap to prevent crabs from crawling from the side faces of an entrance_tunnel onto its upper_surface
claim 1 defines this improvement and is in jepson form
the lengthy preamble describes a conventional_crab_trap and then the body of the claim defines the improvement which comprises
a pair of baffles mounted between opposite edges of said entrance_frame and spaced apart locations on said lateral_face to block said escape route thereby preventing crabs from escaping from said trap
it is clear from the preamble that the` lateral_face' is one of the faces which defines the mouth of an entrance_tunnel
we note that the claim is drafted in terms of a trap having an` entrance_frame' and` a pair of baffles'
it reads equally well on traps in actual use which typically have two entrance_frames and two pairs of baffles
the parties variously refer to the baffles as` anti-escape baffles' and` tanner_fences'

crab traps are often used to trap crab species of different sizes and the second improvement of the071_patent is designed to facilitate the conversion of the trap from one species to another
the patent specification states that king and tanner_crabs are the most heavily fished species in alaskan waters and that of the two the tanner_crab is substantially the smaller
thus the tanner_crab may escape easily through the large mesh in the escapement_panel of the standard trap
to convert the trap to tanner_crab_fishing panels of a smaller_mesh size are secured over the escapement_panel
thus claim 16 reads paragraphing ours 16
in a crab_trap of the type having an outline of a right rectangular prism formed by four lateral_faces of netting extending between a pair of bases covered by netting to form an enclosure the mesh of the netting covering said bases and all but one [ of ] said lateral_faces being of a first_size and the mesh of the netting covering the remaining lateral *1575 face being of a second substantially larger size the improvement comprising a plurality of net_panels having a mesh of said first_size said panels being releasably secured to each other and to said enclosure across said remaining lateral_face so that said trap may be easily converted from a trap for one species of crab to a trap for a different species of crab
appropriately enough the parties refer to these net_panels as` tanner_panels'

the third improvement of the071_patent permits the entrance_frame_opening of the trap to be partially closed when the trap is used for tanner_crab_fishing
this is accomplished through the use of a long rectangular board or panel placed parallel to the entrance_frame_opening and pivotable about one of its long edges so that in at least one position the board partially blocks the entrance_opening
this feature is found for example in dependent_claim 13 paragraphing ours 13
the crab_trap of claim 1 further including means for varying the width of the entrance_opening formed by said entrance_frame comprising
a generally elongated panel having one of its longitudinal_edges pivotally secured to said trap about an elongated_edge of said entrance_frame such that said panel may be pivoted toward said entrance_frame to a partially closed_position or away from said entrance_frame to a full_open_position
the parties variously refer to the` elongated panel' of claim 13 as a` tanner_board' or a` lattice_board'

sjolund asserted infringement of claims 7-10 13 and 16-19
as set forth immediately above the subject_matter of dependent_claim 13 is the combination of a conventional_crab_trap with anti-escape baffles and a tanner_board
claims 7-10 omit the tanner_board but add the element of a plurality of tanner_panels in various stages of refinement
thus the subject_matter of these claims is the combination of a crab_trap with anti-escape baffles and a plurality of tanner_panels
claim 16 is an independent_claim to a conventional_trap in combination with a plurality of tanner_panels
claims 17-19 depend from claim 16 and add the same refinements to the tanner_panel arrangement as are found in claims 8-10

the jury instruction and` special verdict' on obviousness* the jury was asked to decide the question of obviousness
the magistrate instructed the jury as follows defendants claim that plaintiffs patent is invalid for the reason that the inventions contained in the patent were` obvious'
an invention is obvious if the differences between it and the prior_art are such that the invention as a whole would have been obvious at the time it was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which the invention pertains
defendants must prove obviousness by clear and convincing_evidence
these factors have primary relevance to the issue of obviousness 1
the scope and content of the prior_art
the` prior_art' includes inventions already in existence and publicly known
2
the differences between the prior_art and the claims of the plaintiffs patent
3
the ordinary_skill level of a person in the art of the claimed invention
these factors have secondary relevance to the issue of obviousness the commercial_success of the invention ; the existence of a long-felt need that was met by the invention ; the length of time during which the problem if any solved by the invention remained unsolved ; and *1576 the failure of others who attempted to solve the problem addressed by the invention
after being instructed on the law the jury responded to the following question on obviousness

obviousness
2
have defendants proved by clear and convincing_evidence that the inventions described in the following claims of the patent were` obvious' ?
answer yes or no with regard to each claim
answer

claim 18

no

claim 10

no

claim 19

no

claim 13

no

if your answer to this question is` yes' as to one or more claims of the patent you need not answer any of the other questions as to such claims
as indicated with regard to each claim in suit the jury responded that defendants had not carried their burden of proving obviousness
motion for jnov
the jurys responses to all of the questions on the special verdict form were favorable to sjolund and a judgment was entered in his favor on july_1,_1987
on july 14 defendants filed their motion for jnov on the ground inter alia that the claims in suit were invalid for obviousness
the motion was denied that same day without opinion

standard of review
the standard to be applied in reviewing a denial of a motion for jnov is a common procedural question not specifically provided for in any statute or rule
since our decision in panduit_corp. v. all states plastics mfg co. 744_f.2d_1564 223_uspq_465_(fed.cir.1984) per curiam our practice has been to apply the discernable law of the forum to procedural issues not unique to patent law
thus we look to the decisions of the court of appeals for the ninth_circuit to identify our standard of review

that standard is expressed in peterson v. kennedy 771_f.2d_1244_(9th_cir.1985) cert
denied 475_u.s._1122 106_s.ct._1642 90_l.ed.2d_187_(1986)
the court explained we review the propriety of a jnov under the same standard that is applied by the district court
a jnov is proper when the evidence permits only one reasonable_conclusion as to the verdict
we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party
a jnov is improper if reasonable minds could differ over the verdict
peterson v. kennedy 771 f.2d at 1252 citations omitted ; see also venegas v. wagner 831_f.2d_1514 1517 9th_cir.1987 ; rinker v. county of napa 831_f.2d_829 831 9th_cir.1987
denial of a jnov is inappropriate and must be reversed when it is clear that the evidence and its inferences can not reasonably support judgment in favor of the opposing party
pierce v. southern pacific transportation co. 823_f.2d_1366 1369 9th_cir.1987 ; transgo inc. v. ajac transmission parts corp. 768_f.2d_1001 1014 9th cir.1985 cert
denied 474_u.s._1059 106_s.ct._802 88_l.ed.2d_778_(1986)
the ninth_circuit has also recognized that where a jury is asked to decide a question of law which depends on underlying factual determinations the jurys legal conclusion is subject to independent_review by the court on appeal

analysis
( a the prior_art
it was uncontroverted that many relevant devices were old and the jury must have accepted their status as prior_art
the first of these devices is the conventional_king_crab_trap
the description of the prior_art in the071_patent states that` [ c ] onventional crab_traps have been used in their present form for many years'
this same trap is defined in the preamble of claim 1 which is a jepson_claim
since *1577 the preamble of a jepson_claim is impliedly admitted to be prior_art see pentec inc. v. graphic controls corp. 776_f.2d_309 315 227_uspq_766 770 fed.cir.1985 ; reading & bates construction co. v. baker energy resources corp. 748_f.2d_645 649-50 223_uspq_1168 1172 fed.cir.1984 ; in re ehrreich 590_f.2d_902 909-910 200_uspq_504 510 ccpa 1979 and the specification confirms this implied admission the jury must have accepted the conventional_trap as prior_art as a matter of law

the combination of a conventional_trap with tanner_boards of various sorts was also well known prior to sjolunds invention
the description of the prior_art in the071_patent discusses two types albeit in language which is at times obscure
roger_sjolund testified that the` johnson_board' or` v-board' is described in the following passage of the specification as a` baffle_plate' attempts have been made to improve the yield of conventional_crab_traps by preventing crabs from leaving the trap
however all such attempts have focused on preventing the crab from exiting through the entrance_frame
this approach has met with little success since these structures have the effect of deterring crabs from entering
in one of these approaches a baffle_plate angles upwardly from the longitudinal_edge of the rectangular opening closest to the end of the trap
the plate does not prevent the crabs from entering the trap since its inner end is spaced a sufficient distance above the opening
however an escaping crab crawling along the inner surface of the second panel crawls along the upper_surface of the plate and falls off its inner edge back into the trap
moreover the johnson_board or v-board is shown in fig._13 of the patent
the` board' is actually made of a rectangular sheet of rigid plastic which is heated and bent along its long_axis so that the finished board appears as a` v' in cross-section
the specification states that an installed johnson_board is pivotable about its long_axis
while the above quotation from the specification discusses only that portion of the board defined by one leg of the` v' a later passage makes clear that the portion of the board defining the second leg of the` v' is used to` reduce [ ] the width of the opening formed by the entrance_frame'

aside from the johnson_board it was well known to use a simple wooden_board to restrict the width of the entrance_opening
again this is stated in the description of the prior_art in the specification at present the opening formed by the entrance_frame is usually narrowed by securing a board to the frame along one longitudinal_edge of the frame typically by using large rubber bands
sjolund testified that when he first visited crab fishermen to learn something about crab_traps and with an eye to improving them the use of the wooden_boards was one of the first_things he noticed q
and did these fishermen express to you any needs that they faced in their industry ?
a
...
i would say` what are these tanner_boards for on a pot ?'
they would say well youve got to restrict the opening size from the standard nine nine and a half inch king crab size down to i think it was four and a half inches
and they would explain to me why they put boards in
they used actual wooden one-by-fours
that was one of the first_things that caught my eye
sjolund testified along the same vein with regard to the johnson_board
as a matter of law the jury must have accepted the johnson_board and the wooden_board as prior_art

tanner panels also were known in the prior_art
again a description is found in the071_patent itself the relatively large mesh netting covering the escapement_end of the trap is normally converted to a smaller_mesh by either of two conventionally used techniques
the simplest technique is to simply tie a net over the escapement_end of the trap
the second technique is to mount a rectangular frame having a *1578 smaller_mesh over the escapement_end of the trap
the principal disadvantage of the last mentioned technique is the need to buy store and carry various size frames to fit various size crab_traps
sjolund referred to the first technique as sewing a` hanger' or` curtain' into the trap
in the second method the frame-and-net arrangement is simply referred to as a` tanner_panel'
as in the case of the johnson_board and the wooden_tanner_board we think the jury was obligated to accept the framed tanner_panel and the curtain as prior_art as a matter of law

there was also evidence introduced by defendants of a prior_art device relevant to the anti-escape baffles of the071_patent
in this regard defendants relied on the testimony of captain leif nordbo of the fishing boat flying cloud
nordbo testified that in 1978 for his account defendant peter_musland built 500 crab_traps into which were sewn to nordbos specification pieces of netting or webbing at the same spot as the anti-escape baffles claimed in the071_patent
nordbo testified that he paid musland three dollars apiece for the sewn-in nettings
four pages of undated allegedly contemporaneous sketches were introduced into evidence in support of nordbos testimony
the first three nordbo testified were his illustrations of how he wanted his traps constructed to include the new piece of netting and other features
nordbo testified he did not draw the fourth sketch which showed the bridle end of a crab_trap below which the notation` 2 small t. panels' appeared
another notation` tanner fence' appeared above a small line drawing in a lower corner of the paper which could be interpreted as a depiction of a piece of netting sewn in at the same location where sjolund placed his baffles
the invoices for the traps were also introduced into evidence
it appears that the first invoice became so crowded with notes and figures that a second was drawn up
at the bottom of the second invoice the` remarks' section is filled with handwritten notations
the final notation set in parentheses reads` special tanner fence as per sketch nordbo priced @ time and material'
a check stub for a down payment on the traps was similarly introduced but there was no evidence of any final payment which reflected a charge for the` tanner_fences'

peter_muslands testimony tended to corroborate that of leif nordbo
musland testified that it was nordbo who originally suggested the idea of installing what musland referred to as tanner_fences and that he built 500 pots for nordbo with tanner_fences made of nylon_netting sewn in with nylon twine
and according to musland it was he who explained the concept of the tanner_fences to sjolund q
and did you tell mr. sjolund about this fence idea ?
a
yes
q
did you ever show him a pot with a net sewn into it for a crab fence ?
a
that i ca n't remember
i did take him out and point it out to him where this part had to go from one corner to the other end and up the other corner and down and showed him in the pot exactly where it had to be and how it had to function

while musland had an obvious incentive to testify as he did the fact that nordbo had no demonstrated financial interest in the outcome of the suit supports the trustworthiness of his testimony
the contemporaneous business records also tend to confirm this version of the facts
cf
corona cord tire co. v. dovan chemical corp. 276_u.s._358 381-82 48_s.ct._380 387 72_l.ed._610_(1928)
nonetheless oral testimony to establish the existence of allegedly anticipatory devices has long been viewed with skepticism
see e.g. the barbed wire patent case 143_u.s._275 284-85 12_s.ct._443 447 36_l.ed._154_(1892) ; 1 d. chisum patents ¡± 3.05 [ 2 ] [ c ] 1987
if this were the only evidence a reasonable_jury could certainly have found that prior knowledge or use of the tanner_fences was not proven by clear and convincing_evidence

there was however further evidence to corroborate prior public knowledge or use of the tanner_fences-evidence which a reasonable *1579 jury could not freely disregard
this was the testimony of the inventor roger_sjolund
sjolund plainly admitted on cross-examination that the concept of a device to block the path of crabs onto the upper_surface of the entrance_tunnel was not the product of his own mind but was revealed to him by peter_musland q
do you recall pete [ musland ] ever showing you on a crab pot out in the yard at his place a piece of netting sewn in in a triangular shape in the corner of the pot ?
a
yes
q
he did show you that ?
a
if he did n't show me netting he showed me where they would net that triangular piece in yes
given sjolunds admission substantial evidence supports only one finding namely that tanner_fences in the form of nylon_netting were known or used by others prior to the date of sjolunds invention

thus we conclude that the jury must have accepted five devices as prior_art 1 the conventional_crab_trap ; 2 the` johnson' or` v' tanner_board ; 3 the wooden_tanner_board ; 4 the steel_frame and net tanner_panel ; and 5 the nylon net tanner_fences
in so doing we have heeded the statutory presumption of validity which fixes on the challenger the burden of proving by clear and convincing_evidence the facts necessary to support a legal determination of invalidity
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282
as to the existence and nature of the above five items defendants have met this burden
the jury was not at liberty to disbelieve the evidence which established these devices as prior_art
to put it another way the evidence permits only one reasonable_conclusion with respect to the existence and nature of these devices
see los angeles memorial coliseum comm n v. national football league 726_f.2d_1381 1387 9th cir
( affirming grant of directed verdict in favor of the party having the burden of proof on an issue where only one conclusion could be drawn from the undisputed evidence cert
denied 469_u.s._990 105_s.ct._397 83_l.ed.2d_331_(1984) ; accord aggarwal v. ponce school of medicine 837_f.2d_17 20 1st cir.1988 party having burden of persuasion can prevail on motion for jnov only if that party presents testimony the jury is not at liberty to disbelieve ; hurd v. american hoist & derrick co. 734_f.2d_495 499 10th cir.1984 affirming grant of directed verdict for plaintiff where the plaintiff established his case by evidence that the jury was not at liberty to disbelieve
here the first four devices are described in the071_patent as already known and their existence is uncontroverted
the proof of the fifth device the tanner_fences was of a different nature
the inventors own admission nowhere denied qualified or controverted convinces us that a reasonable_jury could only find that tanner_fences were known in the prior_art
compare connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 220_uspq_193_(fed.cir.1983) in which a jury ignored several key prior_art references in returning a verdict for the patent owner
this court in affirming a grant of jnov for the defendant held that the jury was not free to disregard those references
connell 722 f.2d at 1550 220 uspq at 199-200
we reach the same conclusion here

( b differences between the claimed_invention and the prior_art
the determination of the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art is a factual one
in this case however the differences were not disputed
rather the parties disagreed on the proper construction of the claims and the effect this would have on the determination of the legal questions of the obviousness of the claimed inventions
the significance of this disagreement will become clear as this opinion proceeds

( i claims 7-10
as discussed earlier the subject_matter of claim 7 is a conventional_crab_trap in combination with anti-escape baffles and a plurality of tanner_panels
one difference between the invention and what was old is immediately apparent claim 7 of the071_patent claims a` plurality' of panels-that is to say more than one-whereas the old *1580 practice was to use a single framed panel
a second difference a reasonable_jury could conceivably have found is that while the art showed on the one hand traps using a tanner_panel and on the other traps using tanner_fences of nylon_netting there was no conclusive evidence that the combination of all three elements was found in any one trap
these we believe are the only differences a reasonable_jury could have found if it did not commit any legal errors in construing claim 7
some differences are apparent in multiple dependent_claims 8-10 which specify design_features of the panels-for example that the panels have a rigid rectangular frame with a crossmember and that the panels have interconnecting tabs

( ii claim 13
claim 13 incorporates the anti-escape baffles of claim 1 as well as the tanner_board
there was testimony that wooden_tanner_boards were typically removed from the trap when not in use whereas sjolunds board as specified in claim 13 may be pivoted on its axis to an out-of-the-way position
thus the jury could reasonably have found one difference between sjolunds tanner_board and the wooden_board to be that the wooden_board was not pivotable in the same manner as sjolunds board
but as to the johnson or v-board a reasonable_jury construing the claims in a legally permissible way could only find that there are no differences between the johnson_board and the tanner_board of claim 13

( iii claims 16-19
claims 16-19 are identical to claims 7-10 except that claims 16-19 omit the anti-escape baffles
thus claim 16 is directed to a crab_trap having a plurality of tanner_panels
as in the case of claim 7 one difference the jury could reasonably have found between claim 16 and the prior_art is that claim 16 refers to a plurality of tanner_panels whereas the old practice was to use a single_panel
and as in the case of claims 8-10 claims 17-19 introduce minor differences in terms of design_features e.g. that the panels are constructed on a rigid_frame having a crossmember and that the panels may be connected by means of interlocking tabs
taken together these are the differences we believe a reasonable_jury could have found between the subject_matter of claims 16-19 and the prior_art

( c legal analysis on obviousness
even assuming that the jury settled on a minimal level of skill in the art we conclude that the magistrate erred in failing to grant jnov
since obviousness is a question of law see panduit_corp. v. dennison mfg co. 810_f.2d_1561 1566-68 1_uspq2d_1593 1595-97 fed.cir
) cert
denied -- - u.s. -- -- 107_s.ct._2187 95_l.ed.2d_843_(1987) the magistrates conclusion on this issue is subject to our independent_review
oahu_gas_service inc. v. pacific_resources_inc. 838_f.2d_360_(9th_cir.1988) ; see also structural rubber products co. v. park rubber co. 749_f.2d_707 718-19 223_uspq_1264 1273 fed.cir.1984

we begin with claim 7 which includes the anti-escape baffles and a plurality of tanner_panels
as to the tanner_panels they are defined in claim 7 as` a plurality of panels of netting'
it was well known to use a single net panel having a steel_frame and we think the use of two or more panels to do the same task reflects no more skill than that of one of ordinary_skill in the art
indeed it appears that the impetus for the use of a plurality of panels was that sjolund wished to make his panels of molded plastic and it was not feasible at that time to mold a single_panel of a size large enough to cover the escapement_end of a conventional_trap
the limitations in claims 8-10 to panels having a rigid_frame and interlocking tabs can not serve to take sjolunds effort outside the ken of the routineer
as to the anti-escape baffles claim 7 depends from claim 1 wherein the baffle feature is recited simply as` a pair of baffles' positioned in a certain way
this claim_language reads directly on the prior_art tanner_fences which were made of nylon_netting sewn into conventional_traps in the same position as the` baffles' of the claim
without hesitation we conclude that it would have been obvious to combine *1581 the baffles and tanner_panels in a single trap
considered as a whole the subject_matter of claims 7-10 would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the invention was made

the same result necessarily obtains with respect to claims 16-19 which although they do not include the anti-escape baffles are otherwise identical to claims 7-10

claim 13 claims the anti-escape baffles and the tanner_board in combination with a conventional_trap
the tanner_board is defined in the claim as
a generally elongated panel having one of its longitudinal_edges pivotally secured to said trap about an elongated_edge of said entrance_frame such that said panel may be pivoted toward said entrance_frame to a partially closed_position or away from said entrance_frame to a full_open_position
this reads directly on the prior_art johnson_board
the johnson_board is` a generally elongated panel'` pivotally secured' to the trap in the manner specified
as in claim 13 the johnson_board partially obstructs the entrance_frame_opening in one position ; in a second position the entrance_frame_opening is unobstructed
as the specification of the071_patent states the johnson_board was one of two methods used to restrict the opening of the conventional_king_crab_trap to convert the trap to tanner_crab_fishing
given the notoriety of this method we think it would have been obvious to any crab fisherman to install a johnson_board on a trap incorporating the other element of the combination anti-escape baffles
the subject_matter of claim 13 like that of the other_claims in suit would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art

claim construction is the principal basis on which sjolunds counsel attempted to support the judgment in sjolunds favor
at oral argument counsel stated that while the claims may appear to read on the prior_art certain key terms in the claims such as` baffle' and` panel' are ambiguous
counsel suggested that the jury could have construed these ambiguous terms in light of the specification in such a way that they would distinguish over the prior_art
it was suggested that the term` baffle' properly interpreted means a rigid anti-escape baffle in contrast to the flexible tanner_fences made of nylon_netting
and the word` panel' was said to require when correctly construed a tanner_board of a lattice_construction unlike the johnson_board and the wooden_tanner_board which are solid
in support of this argument counsel referred to tandon corp. v. u.s. international trade commission 831_f.2d_1017 4_uspq2d_1283_(fed.cir.1987)
in tandon this court stated claim interpretation is a question of law having factual underpinnings
when the meaning of key terms of claims is disputed as in this case extrinsic_evidence may be adduced including testimony of witnesses and reference may be had to the specification the prosecution_history prior_art and other_claims
831 f.2d at 1021 4 uspq2d at 1286

we first make it clear that in contrast to tandon this case does not involve any factual questions as to the meaning of events during the prosecution_history or the meaning of extrinsic_evidence adduced to aid in construing disputed claim_language
thus there was no issue of fact for the jury
and second while it is true that claims are to be interpreted in light of the specification and with a view to ascertaining the invention it does not follow that limitations from the specification may be read into the claims which is plainly what counsel suggested the jury was entitled to do
the law is stated clearly in one of the cases which the court in tandon relied on as authority sri_international v. matsushita electric corp. of america 775_f.2d_1107 227_uspq_577_(fed.cir.1985) in banc when claim construction is required claims are construable as above indicated in light of the specification united states v. adams 383_u.s._39 49 [ 86_s.ct._708 713 15_l.ed.2d_572 ] 148_uspq_479 482 1966 yet` [ t ] hat claims are interpreted in light of the specification does not mean that everything expressed *1582 in the specification must be read into all the claims'

if everything in the specification were required to be read into the claims or if structural claims were to be limited to devices operated precisely as a specification-described embodiment is operated there would be no need for claims
nor could an applicant regardless of the prior_art claim more broadly than that embodiment
nor would a basis remain for the statutory necessity that an applicant conclude his specification with` claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject_matter which the applicant regards as his invention'

it is the claims that measure the invention
sri_international 775 f.2d at 1121 227 uspq at 585
as our opinion in sri makes clear the claims define the invention

for the reasons expressed in sri the general principle is that limitations from the specification are not to be read into the claims
we see nothing which would justify a departure from that principle in this case
thus if the jury did construe the word` baffle' to require a rigid design and the word` panel' to require a panel of a latticed construction it erred as a matter of law
the judgment simply can not be supported on the basis suggested by counsel

a final point we consider is the objective evidence of nonobviousness
the argument was made that sjolunds tanner_board which counsel referred to as a` lattice_board' satisfied a long felt need in the crab_fishing industry
in this regard there was evidence that wooden_tanner_boards were unsatisfactory because they were often jarred loose from traps when the traps were launched
the johnson or` v' board suffered from a similar defect ; it was brittle and would sometimes break at the vertex upon impact with the water
additionally both boards were solid and there was evidence that they could act as rudders on sinking traps making it difficult to place the traps in a specific spot on the ocean_floor
it was asserted that sjolunds board with its lattice or open construction avoided these pitfalls and satisfied a long felt need

it may well be that the lattice_board solved all these problems and satisfied a long felt need
indeed in a practical sense it may have been a very important improvement
but we are constrained as was the jury to consider whether the claimed invention satisfied a long felt need or solved problems where others had failed
because the lattice_construction of sjolunds tanner_board is not part of his claimed invention the advantages ascribed to the lattice_construction are irrelevant in terms of the obviousness analysis

the same is true of commercial_success
commercial success is relevant only if it flows from the merits of the claimed invention
with regard to the lattice_board all the evidence was to the effect that its commercial popularity was due to the lattice configuration a feature not claimed
thus the jury was not entitled to draw the inference that the success of these boards was due to the merits of the claimed invention

nor could the jury from the bare evidence of units sold and gross receipts draw the inference that the popularity of the tanner_panels was due to the merits of the invention

conclusion
the magistrate erred in denying defendants motion for jnov
claims 7-10 13 and 16-19 of the sjolund patent are invalid for obviousness

reversed
