opinion
taranto circuit_judge
the district_court in this case refused to disturb a jury_verdict concerning two reissue_patents
the jury found for the patentee on infringement and validity as to most of the asserted claims but it invalidated five claims
the patentee hoyt_fleming appeals the five invalidity_determinations arguing that 1 the testimony offered to establish invalidity was insufficiently specific to support the verdict ; 2 there was insufficient corroboration of the prior_invention relied on for the invalidity_determinations ; and 3 the prior_invention if it existed was abandoned suppressed or concealed disqualifying it from invalidating the claims
the adjudicated infringers escort inc. and beltronics_usa inc. collectively escort cross-appeal on the ground that all of the asserted claims are invalid because flemings reason for seeking reissue did not meet the` error' precondition for obtaining reissue
we affirm

background
hoyt_fleming owns two reissue_patents-u.s. patent nos
re39,038 issued mar._28,_2006 and re40,653 issued mar._10,_2009 -issued under 35 u.s.c.¡± 251
both relate to radar_detectors for detecting police_signals
they claim methods for incorporating as well as apparatuses that *1374 incorporate a global positioning satellite gps unit into a radar_detector
the incorporated gps can reduce false_alarms i.e. the signaling of a police_presence when none exists by allowing the detector to disregard or` lock out' certain_signals from an identified location known to produce such false_alarms e.g. a storefront door opener transmitting a radar signal that can be mistaken for a police_presence

claim 1 of the ¡¬038_patent is representative of the method claims
it reads 1
a method executed by a device having a position of generating an alert to an incoming_radar_signal having a frequency and a signal strength the method comprising the acts of a detecting the incoming_radar_signal ; b determining the position of the device that detected the incoming_radar_signal ; and
( c generating an alert if the position of the device is not within a predetermined distance of a predetermined position
¡¬038_patent col. 6 lines 49-58

claim 18 of the ¡¬038_patent is representative of the apparatus claims
it reads 18
a radar_detector for alerting an operator of a motor vehicle to an incoming police radar signal comprising a a microprocessor ; b a circuit coupled to the microprocessor for detecting the incoming police radar signal ; and
( c a global positioning system receiver coupled to the microprocessor and operable to provide the microprocessor with data that indicates the position of the radar_detector
¡¬038_patent col. 7 lines 53-61

on march_10,_2009 fleming sued escort for infringement of his two patents
at the heart of escorts defenses was the contention that steven orr who works for escort as a consultant had invented a gps-incorporating radar_detector before fleming did-a prior_invention escort invoked to support anticipation and obviousness challenges under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 g and 103 20061 flemings claimed priority_date is april_14,_1999 -the filing date of his original_patent_application
orr alleged that he conceived his invention in 1988 and made a working embodiment that reduced it to practice in april 1996
from 1988_to_1996 orr was working at cincinnati_microwave which owned the potential_patent_rights to the alleged invention at issue
cincinnati_microwave entered bankruptcy on february 14 1997
with orr assisting in the bankruptcy process escort acquired cincinnati_microwaves assets including the potential_patent_rights to the alleged orr_invention during the summer of 1997
escort sought orrs assistance in the new enterprise and orr began working at escort in july 1998
he filed a patent_application to claim his alleged invention with escort as assignee on june_14,_1999 two months after fleming filed his application

the jury in this case found most of flemings asserted claims to be infringed by escort and not to be invalid
it found invalidity however as to five claims of the ¡¬038_patent -claims 1 18 45 47 and 48
the jury invalidated claim 45 as anticipated *1375 by orrs prior_invention
it invalidated claim 18 as anticipated by the orr_invention and also for obviousness in light of orrs invention and two prior-art_patents hoffberg u.s._patent_no._6252,544 and ross u.s._patent_no._5977,884
and it invalidated claims 1 47 and 48 for obviousness in light of orrs prior_invention and two prior-art_patents hoffberg and valentine u.s._patent_no._5146,226

fleming subsequently sought judgment as a matter of law to reverse the jurys five invalidity_determinations
he argued that the testimony regarding invalidity was conclusory that orrs testimony regarding his prior_invention was insufficiently corroborated and that orrs prior_invention-even if it existed-had been abandoned suppressed or concealed within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g 2 disqualifying it as a basis for invalidity
escort in turn sought judgment that flemings patents were invalid arguing that fleming had not identified an` error' in his original_patent u.s._patent_no._6204,798 a prerequisite to securing a reissue_patent under section 251
the district_court denied both sides motions

both parties appeal the district_courts decision
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo applying the same standards as did the district_court in deciding whether the jury_verdict must be reversed
see enovsys llc v. nextel commc'ns inc. 614_f.3d_1333 1341 fed.cir.2010 applying ninth_circuit_law
in doing so we accept express or implied jury factual determinations if supported by substantial_evidence and assess whether those facts support the judgment under the governing legal standards whose interpretation we review de novo
see e.g. baxter healthcare corp. v. spectramed inc. 49_f.3d_1575 1582 fed.cir.1995 applying ninth_circuit_law ; pierce v. underwood 487_u.s._552 558 108_s.ct._2541 101_l.ed.2d_490_(1988)
`` substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as reasonable minds might accept as adequate to support a conclusion even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence'

a
1
flemings first contention on appeal from the five invalidity verdicts is that escorts evidence in support of invalidity was insufficiently specific to support the verdict
flemings argument invokes our rulings that` [ g ] eneral and conclusory testimony.. does not suffice as substantial_evidence of invalidity'
koito mfg co. v. turn-key-tech llc 381_f.3d_1142 1152 fed.cir.2004 ; see cytologix corp. v. ventana med
sys. inc. 424_f.3d_1168 1176 fed.cir.2005 ; motorola inc. v. interdigital tech corp. 121_f.3d_1461 1473 fed.cir.1997
it is not enough simply to introduce a prior-art reference into the record with no testimony showing where the limitations of the claims are to be found
koito 381 f.3d at 1151-52 ; see also fresenius usa inc. v. baxter int l inc. 582_f.3d_1288 1300 fed.cir.2009
in this case the principal prior art was not a patent or publication but the prior_invention of orr who testified extensively about it

we conclude that there was sufficiently specific factual support for the invalidity_determinations
the jurys verdict on invalidity rested on two overlapping classes of findings
the first concerned orrs prior_invention which the jury found *1376 to anticipate claims 18_and_45 -a question of fact
ti grp
auto
sys
( n
am inc. v. vdo n
am. llc 375_f.3d_1126 1133 fed.cir.2004
the second concerned the teachings of the asserted combinations of orrs prior_invention and hoffberg ross and/or valentine
the content of those teachings and the motivation to combine are fact questions see kinetic concepts inc. v. smith & nephew inc. 688_f.3d_1342 1360 1367 fed.cir.2012 which we assume the jury answered in escorts favor in finding claims 1 18 47 and 48 invalid for obviousness
sufficiently specific_evidence supported the jurys findings

the invalidated claims do not contain a large number of limitations so extensive testimony was not required
nevertheless orr and escorts expert dr._grindon together provided testimony that explained how the prior art taught the limitations of each invalidated claim

for example claim 45 recites two limitations 1` a circuit operable to detect an incoming_radar_signal' and 2` a microprocessor operable to disable an alert to the incoming_radar_signal based at least in part upon the position of the radar_detector'
¡¬038_patent col. 10 lines 24-30
as to the first limitation orr explained that part of his invention consisted of a radar_detector that received frequency information allowing the detection of radar signals
j.a
6198
as to the second limitation orr explained that the radar_detector was connected to a gps navigational card and a laptop allowing the muting of certain_signals` when [ he ] hit the spacebar' based on position information expressed in cylindrical coordinates
j.a
6198
as to both limitations dr._grindon evaluated evidence of orrs prior_invention including files that showed` routes that [ orr ] took driving around under different conditions to collect.. position and velocity information from a gps device in his car' j.a
6324 and explained that orrs invention` definitely shows and discloses.. the combination for a radar_detector with a gps system.. combined with a processor in this case a laptop computer.. [ to ] suppress [ ].. false_alerts.. based upon location.. [ and ] the speed of the car.. [ by ] press [ ing ] the space bar on the laptop' j.a
6325

with regard to the other invalidated claims dr._grindon testified in some detail to the aspects of hoffberg ross and valentine-as well as the motivation to combine-that would have made the claimed subject matter obvious at the relevant time
e.g. j.a
6328-29 describing how hoffberg` teach [ es ].. radar detection.. in.. various frequency bands' and` stor [ ing ] information.. to discriminate against false_alarms' ; j.a
6330-31 describing how ross` integrat [ es ] a system with a radar_detector and a gps and then a processor.. [ to ] address [ ] the same problem of false_alarms and false_alerts' through a comparison of` [ t ] he speed of the vehicle which is derived from the gps unit.. with [ a ] preset maximum' ; j.a
6332-33 describing how valentine` address [ es ] the problem of false_alerts in a very similar but slightly different way [ from hoffberg ]' by` discriminat [ ing ] the signals based on frequency.. in the same way [ as orrs prior_invention ]'

in light of this and other testimony we can not say that the invalidity challenge was supported by only conclusory testimony and unexplained prior-art documents
there was specific_evidence sufficient to support the verdict

2
fleming also challenges the proof of orrs prior_invention by invoking the principle that` oral testimony by an alleged inventor asserting priority over a *1377 patentees rights.. must be supported by some type of corroborating evidence'
woodland trust v. flowertree nursery inc. 148_f.3d_1368 1371 fed.cir.1998 citation and internal_quotation_marks omitted
such evidence is evaluated under` the rule of reason' whereby` all pertinent evidence is examined in order to determine whether the inventors story is credible'
sandt tech. ltd. v. resco metal & plastics corp. 264_f.3d_1344 1350 fed.cir.2001 citations and internal_quotation_marks omitted ; see also medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 437_f.3d_1157 1171 fed.cir.2006` corroboration is fundamentally aboutcredibility`
importantly` [ t ] he law does not impose an impossible standard of independence on corroborative evidence by requiring that every point of a reduction to practice be corroborated by evidence having a source totally independent of the inventor ; indeed such a standard is the antithesis of the rule of reason'
cooper v. goldfarb 154_f.3d_1321 1331 fed.cir.1998 citation and internal_quotation_marks omitted
we have treated the sufficiency of corroboration as a question of fact with the district_courts determination subject to review for clear error
medichem 437 f.3d at 1171-72

here orrs testimony of prior_invention was sufficiently corroborated by the documentary evidence
the record contains 1992 data from gps experiments that orr ran at the time e.g. j.a
7757 frequency plot entitled` ka band in false region record' and 1996 notes and correspondence from orr pertaining to gps and more specifically to` realizing product features identified in.. [ a ] brainstorming meeting.. [ by ] integrat [ ing ] a radar_detector into.. automotive navigation systems' j.a
7352-53
most tellingly perhaps the record contains a 1996 letter from greg blair vice president of cincinnati_microwave addressed to orr and other employees which refers to` entering the etak [ a type of automotive navigation system ] business.. to get speed and position to silence a detector' and to` patent [ ing ] the concept of.. vehicle position muting and then working with the etak folks for a data link to our detectors' j.a
7354

this evidence makes credible orrs general account in 1988 when he had his specific conception various industry participants were thinking generally about equipping radar_detectors with gps to reduce false_alarms ; cincinnati_microwave in particular was interested in the idea ; by 1992 orr was collecting data and working toward reducing the conception to practice ; and in 1996 spurred by great_interest in his project orr reduced his invention to practice
the evidence in referring to frequencies and to using a gps-given location to mute a detector alarm also provides substantial corroboration of the more specific claim limitations concerning lockout frequencies and distances that fleming has highlighted in his argument

fleming is correct that none of the corroborating evidence constitutes definitive proof of orrs account or discloses each claim limitation as written
but the corroboration requirement has never been so demanding
see cooper 154 f.3d at 1331
it is a flexible rule-of-reason demand for independent evidence that as a whole makes credible the testimony of the purported prior_inventor with regard to conception and reduction to practice of the invention as claimed
sandt 264 f.3d at 1350-51
the evidence presented here sufficiently does that

3
flemings final challenge is that even if orr had priority of invention by virtue of his activities through 1996 he lost priority *big_token__1378_under_35__big_token u.s.c.¡± 102 g 2s disqualification of prior_inventions that have been` abandoned suppressed or concealed'
although we accept the facts as found by the jury where as here they are supported by substantial_evidence we have said that` [ s ] uppression or concealment is a question of law which we review de novo'
fujikawa v. wattanasin 93_f.3d_1559 1567 fed.cir.1996
we reject flemings challenge

abandonment suppression or concealment may be shown by proof of the prior_inventors active_efforts to do so or` may be inferred based upon the prior_inventors unreasonable delay in making the invention publicly known'
dow chem co. v. astro-valcour inc. 267_f.3d_1334 1342 fed.cir.2001 ; see also fox grp. inc. v. cree inc. 700_f.3d_1300 1305-06 fed.cir.2012
whether a delay is sufficiently reasonable to avoid the inference` has consistently been based on equitable principles and public policy as applied to the facts of each case'
checkpoint sys. inc. v. u.s. int l trade comm n 54_f.3d_756 761 fed.cir.1995 citation and internal_quotation_marks omitted
for example` delay between the first reduction to practice and public disclosure' is excused` if the inventor continued to refine perfect or improve the invention'
eolas techs inc. v. microsoft corp. 399_f.3d_1325 1333 fed.cir.2005
moreover even` a long period of inactivity need not be a fatal forfeiture if the first inventor resumes work on the invention before the second inventor enters the field'
paulik v. rizkalla 760_f.2d_1270 1272 fed.cir.1985

in this case there is no evidence of any active_efforts to suppress or conceal
and we find the timing of orrs activities leading to his june 1999 patent_application not to warrant an inference of abandonment suppression or concealment
the evidence is sufficient to establish the following facts covering three periods starting from the april 1996 reduction to practice

in the first period before the february 1997 date of cincinnati_microwaves bankruptcy cincinnati_microwave had great_interest in the project j.a
6094 and orr studied refined and improved his invention he studied` selective availability' i.e. signal interference by the military that impaired the use of his invention j.a
6095 and conducted field testing and wrote additional code to perfect his invention j.a
6104-22
in the third period after orr started working at escort in the summer of 1998 he was immediately put to work on his invention and he continued this work at least until he filed for his own patent in june 1999
e.g. j.a
6293 escorts kuhn testifying that escort was motivated to hire orr because of orrs expertise in radar/gps and that kuhn told orr to work on his invention once he joined escort j.a
7494-546 orrs timesheets at escort from july 1998 to july 1999 mentioning work on radar/gps work including` ka falsing improvements'

what happened in the middle period-between february 1997 and summer 1998-is this for a period of` approximately 13 months after the bankruptcy' orr joined another firm to work with` a group of engineers that were designing a cordless telephone'
j.a
6123
the patent rights to orrs radar/gps prior_invention created at cincinnati_microwave were acquired by escort in the bankruptcy and escort set priorities to get its new business going but even so was interested in developing this invention
orr testified that from the middle of 1997 to the middle of 1998 while working elsewhere he was giving escort information about his invention j.a
6182 and that escort was pursuing orrs invention and conferring with *1379 orr about it during that period j.a
6184
escorts kuhn testified that from the start escort was motivated to hire orr because of orrs expertise in radar/gps was seeking to hire him during its startup period and finally did hire orr in july 1998 to adapt his invention to` a new detection scheme' to resolve performance issues
j.a
6287-93

in these circumstances we do not infer suppression concealment or abandonment for two reasons
first in making his argument in this court and in the district_court flemings position has been that his priority_date is april_14,_1999 when he filed his patent_application
that date is later than the dates of orrs conception 1988 and reduction to practice 1996 -not in dispute for purposes of the present issue
it also is later than the latest possible date-summer 1998-that the evidence establishes orr resumed work on his prior_invention when joining escort
even if the focus were solely on orr thus disregarding escort the patent-rights owner and even if orr had abandoned his invention before summer 1998 the defense of abandonment is properly rejected on the ground that orr resumed his active_work before flemings april 1999 priority_date
see paulik 760 f.2d at 1272

second although fleming has not made an argument based on a pre-1999 priority_date the conclusion would not change even if we assumed a may 1998 conception date for fleming for which there is evidence
on that assumption the crucial period for the abandonment analysis would be the time between cincinnati micro-waves february 1997 bankruptcy and orrs july 1998 employment at escort
but what occurred during that period does not warrant an inference of suppression concealment or abandonment
at most there was a reasonable pause in active_work the rights to the invention were transferred from one owner to a new_owner during a period of bankruptcy ; the new_owner concentrated its initial efforts on products ready for immediate sale ; and even during that period the new_owner maintained communication with orr and made efforts to bring him to the firm precisely to resume the work needed to perfect the prior_invention
the delay of active_work in these circumstances was not unreasonable and was consistent with a continuing commitment to pursuing the project to the full extent conditions allowed
in brief the concepts of abandonment suppression and concealment do not fit the facts as reasonably found by the jury

b. escort in its cross-appeal argues that flemings reissue_patents are invalid because there was no` error' in the original_patent a prerequisite to obtaining a reissue_patent
`` determining whether an applicant has met the statutory requirements of 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 is a question of law which we review de novo'
in re clement 131_f.3d_1464 1468 fed.cir.1997
we reject escorts contention

the version of section 251 applicable here reads whenever any patent is through error without any deceptive intention deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective specification or drawing or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim in the patent the director shall on the surrender of such patent and the payment of the fee required by law reissue the patent for the invention disclosed in the original_patent and in accordance with a new and amended *1380 application for the unexpired part of the term of the original_patent
35 u.s.c.¡± 251 2006

escort invokes the requirement that there have been an` error' in the original_patent
errors are not limited to slips of the pen but encompass-and most often are-deliberate drafting choices
see in re dinsmore 757_f.3d_1343 1347-48 fed.cir.2014
not all choices qualify though` it is important whether deficient_understandings by the applicants or their agents gave rise to the patenting choice that reissue is being invoked to correct'
id.at 1348
a drafting choice that rested on` no cognizable false or deficient_understanding of fact or law' but that was say an eyes-open choice made to secure the patent` is noterror as required by section 251'
id.at 1347
that kind of choice is nothing but a` now-regretted choice' which is not error
id
but this case does not fall into that category

the asserted error here is that when drafting his original_patent fleming failed to appreciate the full_scope of his invention and the inadequacy of the original claims for properly capturing the full_scope
this is a classic reason that qualifies as error
id.at 1348
it identifies a deficient_understanding of some combination of fact and law bearing on the meaning of claim language the inventions disclosed in the written description and how particular language does or does not map onto products or processes that could be claimed under section 251 consistent with the written description

escort suggests otherwise by noting flemings explanation that he wrote his original_patent from the perspective of a` programmer'
j.a
5947 5980
that fact however in no way undermines the premise of a mistaken understanding of the scope of the written description and/or claims-it actually helps explain the origin of the error
likewise the fact that it was marketplace developments that prompted fleming to reassess his issued claims and to see their deficiencies j.a
5926-27 5945 does not alter the qualifying character of the reason for reissue
erroneous understandings of the written description or claims are just that regardless of what triggered the recognition of error in those understandings

any reissue_patent of course must meet all of section 251s requirements
but the only challenge presented by escort is the lack of` error'
that challenge is meritless

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts judgment upholding the jurys verdict
