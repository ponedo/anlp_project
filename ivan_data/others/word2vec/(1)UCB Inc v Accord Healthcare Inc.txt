*1314*1317 this case arises under the hatch-waxman act
appellees ucb inc. ; ucb_biopharma_sprl ; research corp. technologies inc. ; and harris frc corp. collectively` ucb' own and/or license u.s. patent no
re38,551
the551_patent covers lacosamide an anti-epileptic drug which treats epilepsy and other central nervous system disorders
ucb holds new drug applications` ndas' that cover its lacosamide anti-epileptic drug approved by the food and drug administration` fda' and marketed under the tradename vimpatthe_r
the551_patent is listed in the fdas approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations` orange book' as covering vimpatthe_r

appellants are generic_drug_manufacturers who filed abbreviated new drug applications` andas' seeking approval for generic versions of vimpatthe_r
pursuant to the governing hatch-waxman provisions appellants certified in their andas that the551_patent is invalid unenforceable or that their proposed generic_lacosamide_products will not infringe the551_patent
consequently ucb sued appellants for patent infringement in the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware
appellants stipulated to infringement of claims 9 10 and 13 of the551_patent but maintained that these claims are invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting obviousness and anticipation

following a bench_trial the district_court made exhaustive fact_findings based on the trial_evidence and concluded that the asserted_claims of the551_patent are not invalid
appellants appeal that decision arguing that the district_court misapplied the legal standards for obviousness-type_double_patenting obviousness and anticipation and that the prior_art anticipates and/or renders the551_patent obvious

as explained more fully below we hold that the district_court applied the correct legal standards in its obviousness-type_double_patenting obviousness and anticipation analyses
and because we discern no clear_error in its underlying_fact_findings we affirm the district_courts ultimate conclusion that the asserted_claims are not invalid

*1318background
a
the551_patent discloses and claims_lacosamide the active ingredient in vimpatthe_r
lacosamide belongs to a class of compounds known as functionalized_amino_acids` faas' having the following_general_structure ?

the r r1 and r3_positions are variables representing the many different chemical groups that can be placed at each position resulting in a vast number of possible faa compounds
these groups may be aromatic heteroaromatic or nonaromatic
aromatic groups have a two-dimensional structure typically organized into rings such as benzene
heteroaromatic groups such as oxygen or nitrogen are also aromatic but contain at least one heteroatom i.e. any atom other than carbon
nonaromatic groups have three-dimensional structures and are not organized into rings

as disclosed in the551_patent lacosamide is the r-enantiomer of n-benzyl-2-acetamido-3-methoxypropion-amide
seebig_token__'551_patent__big_token col. 3_ll._65 -67 col. 38_ll._9 -40
enantiomers a type of stereoisomers are compounds that have the same chemical_structure-i.e. the same atoms are connected to each other in the same way-but differ in orientation in three-dimensional space
these orientations are designated as either` r' or` s.' a 50-50 mixture of two enantiomers is known as a` racemate' or` racemic_mixture'

for its r r1 and r3_positions lacosamide has an unsubstituted_benzyl at r an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 and a nonaromatic methoxymethyl at r3
the specification teaches that` the r_stereoisomer is unexpectedly more potent than the corresponding s stereoisomer and the racemic_mixture'
id
col. 23_ll._31 -33

as of the march 1996 effective filing date of the551_patent no faa had been approved as an anti-epileptic drug nor had any faa advanced to clinical trials
also prior to the551_patent there was no public disclosure of pharmacological efficacy or safety data to support the use of any faa as an anti-epileptic or anticonvulsant_drug
to date vimpatthe_r remains the only approved faa for the treatment of epilepsy

the development of faas as anticonvulsants began in the 1980s with the inventor of the551_patent dr._kohn
in 1985 dr._kohn first disclosed the anticonvulsant_activity of a compound identified as` aab' which provided the proof of concept for the use of faas as anti-epileptic drugs
in 1987 dr._kohn published a paper` kohn 1987' which disclosed the anticonvulsant_activity of different structural analogs of the parent aab compound
kohn 1987 reported results of different_groups at each of the different r_positions of the general faa chemical_structure
kohn 1987 showed that the placement of an aromatic group at the r3_position showed improved anticonvulsant_activity
relevant to the issues here the compounds studied in kohn 1987 used an unsubstituted_benzyl at r and an unsubstituted_methyl at r1
a substituted molecule replaces one of the hydrogen *1319 atoms of the parent molecule with another atom or structure

in 1988 dr._kohn also reported data on the racemate and individual_enantiomers of aab and apb a similar compound to aab except that it contained a phenyl group at r3
this data showed that the r_enantiomers of aab and apb were 10 times more potent than their s_enantiomers
in 1990 this was confirmed by dr._kohn in a study` kohn 1990' in which he concluded` that the anticonvulsant_activity [ of aab and apb ] resided primarily in the r_stereoisomers'
j.a
3240
in this study dr._kohn also kept the r and r1_positions constant as benzyl and methyl respectively while testing the effect of different substituents at the r3_position

finally in 1991 dr._kohn evaluated` compound_3l' a racemate` kohn 1991'
compound 3l contained a methoxyamino group at r3 and exhibited superior anticonvulsant properties
notably like lacosamide compound_3l contained a nonaromatic_group at r3
compound 3l had instability problems however which were of concern for pharmaceutical formulations

in addition to dr._kohns own publications his research was disclosed in a 1987 thesis completed by his graduate student philippe legall` legall'
legall focused on 15 new faas and their potential anticonvulsant activities
relevant here legall disclosed compound_107e
compound_107e is the racemate of the lacosamide_compound claimed in the551_patent meaning that instead of the isolated r-enantiomer lacosamide claimed in the551_patent compound_107e is a mixture of both the r and s_enantiomers
in the study compound_107e belonged to a class of compounds called` polar analogues' of a parent compound 68a
similar to lacosamide legall replaced the r3_position in compound_107e with a nonaromatic_methoxymethyl_group

legall discloses and provides anticonvulsant efficacy data for all 15 compounds except for compound_107e
the class of compounds to which compound_107e belonged all contained nonaromatic_groups and as a class these compounds showed little to no potency resulting in ed50_values ranging from above 100 mg/kg to above 300 mg/kg.1 by comparison legall reported that other proven anticonvulsants had ed50_values of 14.0 18.7 20.1 and 61.0 mg/kg and some other faas had ed50_values of 51.big_token__0_and_62__big_token0 mg/kg
despite not disclosing any pharmacological_data for compound_107e legall speculated that because of its structural_similarities to compound 86b in the study which had an edbig_token__50_of_62__big_token compound_107e` may have good_anticonvulsant_activity'
j.a
5001 5050
legall concluded that the most active compounds studied had heteroaromatic_groups in the r3_position whereas compound_107e had a nonaromatic_group

dr._kohns research led to the filing of u.s._patent_no._5378 729_in_1991 which is prior_art to the551_patent
the729_patent issued to dr._kohn in 1995 and discloses a genus of faas
its specification explains that the claimed compounds exhibit` central nervous system cns activity which are useful in the treatment of epilepsy and other cns disorders'
'729_patent col. 1_ll._30 -33
the compounds of the729_patent share the following general formula *1320

?
id.at_col. 1_ll._37 -43
the729_patent lists many different compounds and groups that can be placed at each r_position which the district_court found could form millions of possible_compounds
important to the issues here the729_patent teaches that` [ t ] he preferred values of r is aryl lower alkyl especially benzyl' and` [ t ] he most preferred r1 group is methyl'
id.at_col. 5_ll._17 -19
for the r3_position the729_patent lists a number of preferred heterocyclics and alkyl and lower alkoxy groups but does not list methoxymethyl
id.at_col. 6_ll._13 -31

the729_patent also discloses table 1 containing pharmacological_data for 54 faas
none of the compounds listed in table 1 are lacosamide compound_107e disclosed in legall or any faa compound with a methoxymethyl_group at r3
all of the compounds listed in table 1 of the729_patent have a methyl at rbig_token__1_and_49__big_token of them have an unsubstituted_benzyl at r all with varying potency ranging from 3.3 mg/kg to over 300 mg/kg
of the top ten compounds with the most potency i.e. lowest ed50 eight had heteroaromatic_groups at r3 and two had nitrogen-based groups
unlike lacosamide none of the most potent_compounds in table 1 had a nonaromatic_group at r3
the four compounds with nonaromatic_groups at r3 showed moderate to weak potency

u.s._patent_no._5654,301 is a continuation-in-part of the729_patent and was filed in 1993
the301_patent is not prior_art to the551_patent
appellants rely on the301_patent only for their argument that the551_patent is invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting
like its parent729_patent the301_patent claims compounds of a general structure and recites several different_groups that can be placed at the r and r1_positions
the relevant claims at issue for purposes of double_patenting are claims 39-47 of the301_patent which are reproduced below 39
a compound of the formula
?
or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein
r is aryl aryl lower alkyl heterocyclic heterocyclic lower alkyl cycloalkyl or lower cycloalkyl lower alkyl wherein r is unsubstituted or is substituted with at least one electron withdrawing group or an electron donating group ; *1321 r1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl and r1 is unsubstituted or substituted with at least one electron withdrawing group or at least one electron donating group ; a and q are both o ; one of r2 and r3 is hydrogen and the other is lower alkyl which is substituted with an electron donating group or a electron withdrawing group and n is 1-4
40
the compound according to claim 39 wherein one of r2 and r3 is hydrogen and the other is lower alkyl substituted with an electron donating group
41
the compound according to claim 40 wherein one of r2 and r3 is alkyl substituted with an electron donating group wherein alkyl is methyl ethyl propyl isopropyl butyl isobutyl t-butyl amyl or hexyl
42
the compound according to claim 41 wherein one of r2 and r3 is methyl substituted with an electron donating group
43
the compound according to claim 42 wherein the electron donating group is lower alkoxy
44
the compound according to claim 43 wherein lower alkoxy is methoxy
45
the compound according to any one of claims 39-44 wherein n is 1
46
an anti-convulsant composition comprising an anti-convulsant effective amount of a compound from any one of claim 37-42 and a pharmaceutical_carrier_therefor
47
a method of treating cns disorders in an animal_comprising administering to said animal an anti-convulsant effective amount of a compound of any one of claims 39-44
'301_patent col. 93_l._3 - col. 94_l._21

independent claim 39 permits a large_number of groups at r r1 and r3 where each group can comprise a large_number of substituents and can be either unsubstituted or substituted
hence the district_court found that claim 39 could be thousands if not millions of possible group combinations
although the specification does list some of the most preferred_groups the list also contains generic categories of substituents creating a large scope of possible groups
although lacosamide is not specifically disclosed in the301_patent it is undisputed that lacosamide falls within the broad genus of claim 39 of the301_patent

claim 45 which depends from claim 44 recites that r3 is a methoxymethyl_group which is the substituent at r3 in lacosamide and claimed in the551_patent
claim 45 does not recite the molecules at r and r1 however
as stated above claim 45 depends from claim 39 which recites a genus of groups that can be located at r and r1

b
the asserted551_patent discloses and claims_lacosamide a species of the genus disclosed in the729 and301_patent s. the claims of the551_patent at issue in this case are claims 9 10 and 13 which are reproduced below along with the claims from which they depend
1
a compound in the r configuration having the formula ?
*1322 wherein
ar is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted with at least one halo group ; q is lower alkoxy and
q1 is methyl
8
the compound according to claim 1 which is r n-benzyl 2-acetamido-3methoxypropionamide
9
the compound according to claim 8 which contains at least 90 % w/w r_stereoisomer
10
a therapeutic composition comprising an anticonvulsant_effective_amount of a compound according to any one of claims 1-9 and a pharmaceutical_carrier_therefor
11
a method of treating central nervous system disorders in an animal_comprising administering to said animal in need thereof an anticonvulsant_effective_amount of a compound according to any one of claims 1-9
12
the method according to claim 11 wherein the animal is a mammal
13
the method according to claim 12 wherein the mammal is a human

claim 9 recites the lacosamide_compound with 90 % or greater_purity
for its r_positions lacosamide has an unsubstituted_benzyl at r an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 and a nonaromatic_methoxymethyl_group at r3.2

c. before the district_court appellants asserted that claims 9 10 and 13 of the551_patent are invalid for obviousnesstype_double_patenting alleging that they are not patentably distinct from claims 44-47 of the301_patent
appellants argued that the compound described in the asserted_claims of the551_patent is merely an obvious species of the genus claimed in the301_patent

following a bench_trial the district_court found that the differences between claim 45 of the301_patent and the asserted_claims of the551_patent rendered the claims patentably distinct
see ucb inc. v. accord_healthcare inc. 201_f.supp.3d_491 530-36 d._del
2016` district_court_opinion'
relying on among other things the lack of supporting efficacy data investigating the impact of placing an unsubstituted_benzyl and methyl at r and r1 the district_court concluded that it would not have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art to make lacosamide by placing an unsubstituted_benzyl at r or an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 in combination with methoxymethyl at r3
id

appellants also asserted that legalls disclosure of the racemic_mixture_compound_107e alone or in combination with the729_patents disclosure of the genus of faas and kohn 1991s disclosure of compound_3l rendered the asserted_claims of the551_patent obvious
id.at 540
the district_court applied a lead_compound_analysis and concluded that as of march 1996 a skilled_artisan would not have selected any faa let alone compound_107e legall or compound_3l kohn 1991 as a lead_compound
id.at 542-43
the district_court based this finding on the complete lack of data to support that these compounds were effective and kohn 1991s disclosure that nonaromatic_compounds were generally disfavored
id

finally appellants asserted that the551_patent was anticipated by legalls disclosure of the racemic_mixture of compound_107e which necessarily discloses the enantiomers of that mixture including the *1323 r_enantiomer lacosamide
id.at 544
relying on our decision in sanofi-synthelabo v. apotex inc. 550_f.3d_1075 1084 fed
cir
2008 the district_court held that legall does not anticipate the asserted_claims because while it discloses the racemic_mixture_compound_107e it does not explicitly disclose the r-enantiomer or its characteristics
id

appellants appeal the district_courts fact_findings and conclusions on double_patenting obviousness and anticipation
invalidity under any of these three theories must be established by clear and convincing_evidence
microsoft corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship 564_u.s._91 95 131_s.ct._2238 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011)
thus in order to prevail on appeal appellants must show that the district_court clearly erred in failing to find clear and convincing_evidence of invalidity
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

i. obviousness-type double patenting
we first address appellants argument that the district_court erred in holding that the asserted_claims of the551_patent are not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting

by statute only a single patent may issue for the same_invention
see35 u.s.c.¡± 101` whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process machine manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof may obtain a patent therefor..' emphasis added ; in re lonardo 119_f.3d_960 965 fed
cir
1997` [ section 101 ] thus permits only one patent to be obtained for a single invention and the phrasesame_invention refers to an invention drawn to substantially identical subject_matter
``

nonstatutory double_patenting however is a judicially-created doctrine which` prohibits an inventor from obtaining a second_patent for claims that are not patentably distinct from the claims of the first_patent'
id.at 965
it` prevent [ s ] the extension of the term of a patent even where an express statutory basis for the rejection is missing by prohibiting the issuance of the claims in a second_patent not patentably distinct from the claims of the first_patent'

cir
1985 alteration in original

the obviousness-type double_patenting_analysis involves two steps` first the courtconstrues the claim [ s ] in the earlier patent and the claim [ s ] in the later patent and determines the differences
second the courtdetermines whether those differences render the claims patentably distinct

cir
2010
the second part of this analysis is analogous to the obviousness inquiry under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 in the sense that if an earlier claim renders obvious or anticipates a later_claim the later_claim is not patentably distinct and is thus invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting
id.at 1378-79
in chemical cases the double_patenting inquiry is not whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would select the earlier_compound as a lead_compound but rather whether the later_compound would have been an obvious or anticipated modification of the earlier_compound
otsuka 678 f.3d at 1297
unlike in an obviousness_analysis the underlying patent in the double_patenting_analysis need not be prior_art to the later_claim
see id

we review the district_courts ultimate legal conclusion of obviousness-type *1324 double_patenting de novo and review its underlying_fact_findings for clear_error
abbvie 764 f.3d at 1372
`` a factual_finding is clearly erroneous if despite some supporting evidence we are left with the definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been made'
otsuka 678 f.3d at 1290

a
before the district_court the parties disagreed as to the correct legal test for obviousness-type_double_patenting
appellants argued that only the differences between claims 44-47 of the301_patent and claims 9 10 and 13 of the asserted551_patent are to be considered
ucb argued that the claims as a whole should be considered including the commonalities between the claims and whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to also modify any of those commonalities when modifying the differences between the claims
specifically ucb argued that the court should consider whether the commonly shared r3 methoxymethyl_group in the301 and551_patent s would have been substituted with another substituent when considering which substituents to place at the r and r1_positions
the district_court adopted appellants theory but held that the asserted_claims are not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting under either theory

we agree with appellants that the obviousness-type_double_patenting inquiry requires consideration of the differences between the claims in the reference301_patent and the551_patent
as we stated above the focus of the double_patenting_analysis entails determining the differences between the compounds claimed in the reference and asserted patents and then` determin [ ing ] whether those differences render the claims patentably distinct'
abbvie 764 f.3d at 1374 emphasis added
in this case both claims recite a methoxymethyl_group at r3
thus the double_patenting_analysis requires determining whether the claims differences i.e. unsubstituted_benzyl and methyl at r and r1 would have been obvious to one of skill in the art

at the same time as we explained in eli_lilly & co. v. teva parenteral medicines inc. 689_f.3d_1368_(fed._cir._2012)` those differences [ between the claims ] can not be considered in isolation-the claims must be considered as a whole'
id.at 1377
indeed` just as ¡± 103 a requires asking whether the claimed subject_matteras a whole would have been obvious to one of skill in the art so too must the subject_matter of the [ asserted_claims ] be consideredas a whole to determine whether the [ reference_patent ] would have made those claims obvious for purposes of obviousness-type_double_patenting'
id.at 1377 quoting gen. foods corp. v. studiengesellschaft kohle mbh 972_f.2d_1272 1278 fed
cir
1992
thus the district_court did not err by focusing its double_patenting_analysis on the claims differences as well as the claims as a whole

we turn next to the district_courts double_patenting_analysis
appellants assert that claims 9 10 and 13 of the551_patent are not patentably distinct from claims 44-47 of the301_patent and are thus invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting
because these claims only have a common methoxymethyl_group at the r3_position the question before us is whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art starting with claim 45 of the301_patent would have been motivated to place an unsubstituted_benzyl at r and an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 in combination with the methoxymethyl_group at r3 with a reasonable_expectation of success
we acknowledge that this is a close case but because we discern no clear_error in the *1325 district_courts underlying fact_finding that there would have been no reasonable_expectation of success in placing an unsubstituted_benzyl and methyl in the claimed combination we agree with the district_court that the asserted_claims of the551_patent are patentably distinct from the301_patent

the differences between claim 45 of the301_patent and claim 9 of the551_patent are that 1 unlike claim 45 of the301_patent claim 9 of the551_patent requires the r-enantiomer with 90 % or greater_purity ; 2 while claim 45 of the301_patent allows for any substituted or unsubstituted` aryl aryl lower alkyl heterocyclic heterocyclic lower alkyl cycloalkyl or lower cycloalkyl lower alkyl' at r the551_patent requires an unsubstituted_benzyl at r ; and 3 while claim 45 of the301_patent allows r1 to be a substituted or unsubstituted hydrogen or lower alkyl with at least one electron withdrawing or donating group the551_patent requires r1 to be an unsubstituted_methyl
comparebig_token__'301_patent__big_token col. 93_l._3 - col. 94_l._15 with557_patent col. 38_ll._8 -39

focusing on these differences the district_court found that as of the priority_date a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have had a reasonable_expectation that placing an unsubstituted_benzyl at r or an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 with a methoxymethyl_group at r3 would have yielded an efficacious anticonvulsant faa
the district_court recognized that in the context of drug_development`predictability is a vital consideration in the obviousness_analysis including obviousness-type_double_patenting'
district_court_opinion 201 f.supp.3d at 531 quoting otsuka 678 f.3d at 1298
we agree that proving that a claim is invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting` requires identifying some reason that would have led a chemist to modify the earlier_compound to make the later_compound with a reasonable_expectation of success'

2009` an obviousness_determination requires that a skilled_artisan would have perceived a reasonable_expectation of success in making the invention in light of the prior_art`
here the district_court relying on the prior_art and expert evidence found no reasonable_expectation of success
that is a fact_finding that we review for clear_error following a bench_trial
par pharm. inc. v. twi pharm. inc. 773_f.3d_1186 1196 fed
cir
2014
we hold that the district_courts fact_finding of no reasonable_expectation of success is sufficiently supported by the evidence presented at trial and is not clearly erroneous
we are not left with` the definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been made'
otsuka 678 f.3d at 1290
we are satisfied that the district_court did not clearly err

as the district_court found by the priority_date there was little to no data from which a person of ordinary_skill in the art could have formed reasonable_expectations about the effect of placing an unsubstituted_benzyl at r and an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 in combination with a methoxymethyl_group at r3
out of all the work performed by dr._kohn and others not a single reference disclosed any anticonvulsant data for any compound comprising a methoxymethyl_group at r3 let alone lacosamide
and most of the faas studied prior to the priority_date only experimented with modifying the substituents at the r3_position while holding constant the unsubstituted_benzyls at r and unsubstituted_methyls at r1
see district_court_opinion 201 f.supp.3d at 504 531
thus the district_court reasonably found that the prior_art_data studying faas did not provide sufficient insight into the effectiveness of *1326 placing benzyl and methyl at those positions relative to other_substituents that could have been placed at the r and r1_positions
id.at 531
this finding was supported by dr._roush who explained that the prior_art was silent as to what role_benzyl and methyl played in the activity of the faas studied in the prior_art
the district_court buttressed its finding with the data disclosed in the729_patent showing that compounds with benzyl and methyl at r and r1 with different r3_groups had a varying range of effectiveness
id
( citing729_patent at table 1
thus the trial_evidence supports the district_courts finding that there was no prior_art that would have provided a person of ordinary_skill_reason to believe that unsubstituted_benzyl and methyl would have been successful with a methoxymethyl_group
because these findings are supported by expert_testimony and the record we conclude that they are not clearly erroneous
see eli_lilly 689 f.3d at 1378 affirming the district_courts obviousness-type_double_patenting determination based on its fact_finding of no reasonable_expectation of success ; see also amgen 580 f.3d at 1362-63 affirming the district_courts judgment as a matter of law that the asserted_claims were not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting where the trial_evidence supported a finding of no reasonable_expectation of success

the dissent states that the district_court erred by not considering legall in its primary double-patenting analysis
dissent op.at 1334
we disagree with the dissents characterization of the district_courts opinion
the district_courts fact_findings regarding legall spanned thirteen paragraphs
district_court_opinion 201 f.supp.3d at 508-09
in what the dissent characterizes as the district_courts` primary' double_patenting_analysis the district_court also relied on dr._roushs expert_testimony specifically discussing legall
that portion of dr._roushs testimony explained that because r and r1 were held constant in the compounds studied in legall one could not tell what role_benzyl and methyl had in the activity of the compounds disclosed
id.at 531-32 citing roush tr
681-82
moreover in its analysis under ucbs proffered alternative double_patenting test the district_court rejected appellants argument that the claims of the551_patent are indistinguishable from the discussion of compound_107e in legall
id.at 535-536
the district_court explained that legalls reference to compound_107e lacks any data or discussion that would have motivated a person of ordinary_skill in the art to use a nonaromatic_compound such as a methoxymethyl at r3
id.at 535-36
thus far from ignoring legall as the dissent suggests the district_court squarely considered and addressed legall in its double_patenting_analysis

the` presence or absence of a reasonable_expectation of success is.. a question of fact' par pharm. 773 f.3d at 1196 and after considering the prior_art and expert_testimony presented at trial the district_court found no reasonable_expectation of success
we can not reweigh the evidence make credibility findings or find facts
the district_court relying on legall and crediting expert_testimony made extensive fact_findings regarding the legall_thesis
as the district_court found legall discloses no data whatsoever for compound_107e or any compound with a methoxymethyl_group at the r3_position
district_court_opinion 201 f.supp.3d at 508
in fact the data legall did disclose for similar polar analogue compounds showed little to no potency
id
the district_court acknowledged that legall speculated that compound_107e` may' have good_anticonvulsant_activity based on its structural_similarity to another compound
id.at 509
dr._roush testified however that a person of ordinary_skill in the art looking to legall *1327 would have had no interest in pursuing that compound and that a person of ordinary_skill would not have had a reasonable likelihood of success in pursuing an faa with a methoxymethyl_group at r3 as an anticonvulsant_drug
the district_court did not clearly err in crediting this testimony

appellants argue that the729_patents disclosure that benzyl is` especially preferred' and that methyl is` most preferred' for this genus of compounds itself renders the asserted_claims obvious
we disagree
the729_patent describes other possible variants as` preferred compounds'` preferred embodiments' or preferred_groups for each position indicating a large variety of possible_compounds
seebig_token__'729_patent__big_token cols
5-10
as we held in eli_lilly complex compounds like the faas disclosed in the729_patent provide for many opportunities for modification
as the district_court found here there was no indication that out of the millions of possible choices an unsubstituted_benzyl at r and an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 would have been selected in combination with a methoxymethyl_group at r3 to arrive at lacosamide
see eli_lilly 689 f.3d at 1378
because the district_court did not clearly err in finding that there was no motivation to modify the301_patents claims to arrive at lacosamide or a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so we uphold the district_courts conclusion that claims 9 10 and 13 of the551_patent are not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting

appellants also argue that the district_court erred by requiring them to prove that benzyl and methyl were the` best' substituents from which to choose
this is a mischaracterization of the district_courts decision
the district_court merely quoted dr._roushs expert_testimony that in the prior_art` [ t ] here is no data to say whether benzyl is best or something else would be the best'
district_court_opinion 201 f.supp.3d at 532 quoting dr._roushs trial_testimony
in context however it is clear that the district_court merely relied on this testimony to support its finding that the prior_art_data demonstrated a range of effectiveness such that the effectiveness of prior_art_compounds could not be attributed to benzyl
we do not read the district_courts opinion to have required appellants to prove that benzyl was the best selection

appellants further argue that lacosamide falls within the broad scope of claim 45 of the301_patent and is thus presumed enabled
appellants argue that this presumption establishes a reasonable_expectation of success as a matter of law
we disagree
appellants do not cite any authority for the proposition that the presumption of an enabled genus of compounds precludes the district_court from finding that there was no reasonable_expectation of success of creating a species falling within that genus
moreover such a result would have a chilling effect on genus claiming in the chemical arts as there would be double_patenting in all chemical compound cases where a parent patent claims a genus

because we hold that the district_courts finding regarding no reasonable_expectation of success was not clearly erroneous we are compelled to affirm the district_courts conclusion that the asserted_claims of the551_patent are not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting.3 also for *1328 this reason we need not reach the district_courts findings regarding secondary considerations and appellants argument that the district_court failed to find a nexus between the asserted secondary considerations and lacosamide

ii
obviousness
next we address obviousness
we review the district_courts ultimate determination that the asserted_claims of the551_patent would not have been obvious de novo and review its underlying_fact_findings for clear_error
otsuka 678 f.3d at 1290

appellants assert that claim 9 of the551_patent would have been obvious based on legalls disclosure of compound_107e as a racemic_mixture
appellants further assert that legall alone or in combination with the729_patent and kohn 1991 render claim 9 obvious
applying a lead_compound_analysis the district_court concluded that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have selected any faa let alone the compounds disclosed in legall and kohn 1991 as lead_compounds in the lead_compound_analysis
relying on our decision in aventis pharma deutschland gmbh v. lupin ltd. 499_f.3d_1293_(fed._cir._2007) appellants argue that the district_court erred by using a lead_compound_analysis because this case merely involves purification not structural modification of a known compound
we disagree

`` in cases involving the patentability of a new_chemical_compound prima_facie obviousness under the third graham factor generally turns on the structural_similarities and differences between the claimed compound and the prior_art_compounds'
otsuka 678 f.3d at 1291
we have held that to demonstrate that a new_chemical_compound would have been prima_facie obvious over a particular prior_art compound based on a lead_compound_analysis the court follows a two-part inquiry
first` the court determines whether a chemist of ordinary_skill would have selected the asserted prior_art_compounds as lead_compounds or starting_points for further development efforts'
id
second the court determines` whether the prior_art would have supplied one of ordinary_skill in the art with a reason or motivation to modify a lead_compound to make the claimed compound with a reasonable_expectation of success'
id.at 1292
a lead_compound is` a compound in the prior_art that would be most promising to modify in order to improve upon its.. activity and obtain a compound with better activity'
id.at 1291 quoting takeda chem indus. ltd. v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1357 fed
cir
2007

appellants argue however that this court has never required a lead_compound_analysis in chemical purification cases
appellants further cite aventis where we addressed whether the pure 5 s stereoisomer of ramipril in a form substantially free of other isomers would have been obvious over the prior_art disclosing its racemic_mixture
aventis 499 f.3d at 1300
there we held that the` structural_similarity between claimed and prior_art subject_matter proved by combining references or otherwise where the prior_art *1329 gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions creates a prima_facie case of obviousness'
id.at 1301
we stated further that where a claimed composition is a purified form of a mixture that existed in the prior_art and` if the prior_art would provide a person of ordinary_skill in the art with reason to believe [ it had desirable_properties ] the purified compound is prima_facie obvious over the mixture even without an explicit teaching that the ingredient should be concentrated or purified` id
( emphasis added

appellants argue that because aventis did not apply a lead_compound_analysis no such analysis is required in this case
we agree
a lead_compound_analysis is not required in analyzing obviousness of a chemical compound when in the inventing process there was no lead_compound
an inventor may not have tried to improve a compound known to have desirable_properties
see e.g. otsuka 678 f.3d at 1291` new compounds may be created from theoretical considerations rather than from attempts to improve on prior_art_compounds`
and an obviousness rejection by an examiner or a challenge in court may be based on the closest prior_art which may not have been a lead_compound that the inventor had in mind

we are not aware of any authority holding that a lead_compound_analysis is or is not required in cases involving purifying mixtures
aventis simply required proving that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to purify a mixture of compounds based on some known desirable_property
see aventis 499 f.3d at 1301 holding that` if it is known that some desirable_property of a mixture derives in whole or in part from a particular one of its components or if the prior_art would provide a person of ordinary_skill in the art with reason to believe that this is so the purified compound is prima_facie obvious over the mixture'

in any event even if a lead_compound_analysis is required here we hold that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have selected compound_107e as a lead_compound
as we have stated the district_court found that legall contains no data that would have led a person of ordinary_skill in the art to select compound_107e among the many compounds disclosed in legall as a lead_compound
the district_court further found that the data provided in legall for that class of compounds showed little potency
dr._roush also testified that based on legalls disclosure a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to develop compound_107e
we see no clear_error in the district_courts factual_findings based on such evidence

we also see no clear_error in the district_courts fact_finding that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have selected kohns 1991_compound_3 l as a lead_compound
kohns compound_3l is also a nonaromatic_compound like compound_107e and dr._roush testified that nonaromatic_compounds were not of interest as of 1996
the district_courts fact_finding was also supported by additional expert_testimony which established that compound_3l had properties making it less stable and that medicinal chemists would have avoided investigating its potential use in a pharmaceutical product

based on this evidence we see no clear_error in the district_courts fact_findings and sustain its conclusion that the asserted_claims of the551_patent would not have been obvious

iii
anticipation
finally we address anticipation
only appellants accord_healthcare inc. and intas_pharmaceuticals_ltd. the` accord *1330 appellants' raise anticipation on appeal
they argue that because legall discloses the chemical_structure of the racemic compound_107e it necessarily discloses the r-enantiomer lacosamide recited in claim 9 of the551_patent

relying principally on our decision in sanofi 550 f.3d at 1084 the district_court found claim 9 of the551_patent not anticipated concluding that legall discloses neither the r-enantiomer of compound_107e nor any of its characteristics
anticipation is also a question of fact which we review for clear_error
see sanofi 550 f.3d at 1082

we hold that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that legall does not anticipate claim 9 of the551_patent
as the district_court recognized we have held that` [ t ] he knowledge that enantiomers may be separated is notanticipation of a specific enantiomer that has not been separated identified and characterized'
id.at 1084
we have also stated that` the novelty of an optical isomer is not negated by the prior_art disclosure of its racemate'
in re may 574_f.2d_1082 1090 ccpa 1978
although legall discloses the chemical_structure of the racemic compound_107e it does not disclose its separation into individual_enantiomers nor does it disclose any pharmaceutical data of the r_enantiomer recited in claim 9 of the551_patent
as the accord appellants point out legall expressly stated that he` prepare [ d ] the racemic amino acid derivatives rather than the individual_enantiomers' and that` [ i ] n each case the functionalized amino acid racemate was prepared rather than the individual_enantiomers'
j.a
4942 ; j.a
5030 emphasis added
thus we discern no clear_error in the district_courts finding of no anticipation

conclusion
we have considered the parties remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts judgment that the asserted_claims of the551_patent are not anticipated obvious or invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting

affirmed

two years later dr._kohn reported on the anticonvulsant_activity of sixteen structural analogues of aab

the paper used unsubstituted_benzyl at r and unsubstituted_methyl at r1 as a` reference_point' and considered five possible_modifications of the unsubstituted_benzyl at r and three modifications of the unsubstituted_methyl at r1
id.at 506

in dr._kohns 1990 paper he also kept` r1 constant and r constant' as methyl and benzyl respectively
id.at 509
he reported that the most potent_compound was 2g which had benzyl at r and methyl at r1
id
unlike lacosamide 2g had an aromatic 2-furanyl structure at r3
id
compound 2g` was found to be significantly more potent than apb [ described in a 1988 paper ] and at the time in 1990 when this paper was published this was the most potent_compound in the faa family'
id

dr._kohn then summarized his prior faa work in a 1991 paper
id
all twenty-six compounds reported in that paper had unsubstituted_benzyl at r and unsubstituted *1333 methyl at r1 with different compounds at the r3_group
id.at 506-07
dr._kohn explained in this paper that` you get potent_protection if you have a benzyl on one end [ at r ] and a methyl on the other [ at r1 ]'
id.at 506
the 1991 paper also identified compound_3l which possessed` the best activity to date' for any faa racemate
id.at 507
compound 3l had unsubstituted_benzyl at r and unsubstituted_methyl at r1 with methoxyamino at r3
id

dr._kohn continued to explore and publish data for many other compounds with different_groups at r3
id.at 506
in a 1993 paper dr._kohn published the results of an experiment investigating modifications of the 2-furanyl group at r3 with other heteroaromatic_groups
once again the` starting_point' was benzyl at r and methyl at r1
id

on this record it is clear that dr._kohns extensive study of faas provides copious amounts of information from which a person of ordinary_skill would form a reasonable_expectation that the selection of an unsubstituted_benzyl for r and an unsubstituted_methyl for r1 would lead to the successful creation of an faa with anticonvulsant_activity
indeed dr._kohn described unsubstituted_benzyl for r and an unsubstituted_methyl for r1 as the` starting_point' or` reference_point' for nearly every experiment he published
dr._kohn himself explained in his 1991 paper where all 26 compounds reported had unsubstituted_benzyl at r and unsubstituted_methyl at r1 that` you get potent_protection if you have a benzyl on one end [ at r ] and a methyl on the other [ at r1 ]` 1id.at 506

the district_court recognized that` there were many_tests conducted on faas with benzyl at r and methyl at r1'
id.at 531
but it dismissed the resulting data because` [ m ] ost of these tests kept the structures at r and r1 constant in order to assess changes made at the r3_position' and so` any changes whether increases or decreases observed in anticonvulsant_behavior and/or neurotoxicity would be attributed to the structure at r3 rather than to the benzyl at r or the methyl at r1'
id
in dismissing the data resulting from these tests the court clearly erred
although the experiments may have been designed to assess changes made at the r3_position by using unsubstituted_benzyl for r and an unsubstituted_methyl for r1 as the` starting_point' or` reference_point' for these tests the prior_art showed without question that those substituents would work at those positions
and not only did the prior_art show that unsubstituted_benzyl works at r and that unsubstituted_methyl works at r1 the prior_art showed that faas with these substituents so positioned demonstrate anticonvulsant_activity

it was clear_error for the district_court to require testing to provide` insight into the effectiveness of benzyl and methyl relative to other structures that could be placed at r and r1'

where the prior_art teaches that the selected substituent will work even when it is selected from thousands of compounds an inability to predict how any one substituent will work in the composition and a need for testing will not render that selection nonobvious

further if as the district_court found all the testing focused on r3 and a person of ordinary_skill would attribute anticonvulsant_behavior to r3 once r3 was fixed in the301 reference_patent genus plugging in unsubstituted_benzyl at r and unsubstituted_methyl at r1 which had remained largely constant throughout the prior_art testing would be viewed simply as a trivial selection
indeed because the301 claim is a genus claim with only two variables r and r1 a person of ordinary_skill would know to select a substituent for each variable
a person of ordinary_skill would certainly have a reasonable_expectation of success when deciding which substituents to select if she copied the` 75 % of dr._kohns compounds [ which ] contained benzyl at r and methyl at r1 and most of these were unsubstituted'
district_court_opinion 201 f.supp.3d at 531

in dismissing the data resulting from the many_tests conducted with unsubstituted_benzyl at r and unsubstituted_methyl at r1 and in relying so heavily on what it saw as a lack of data the district_court clearly erred

b
the district_court also erred when it found that the limited data that did exist at the time would not have led a person of ordinary_skill to place an unsubstituted_benzyl at r or an unsubstituted_methyl at r1
id.at 532
indeed the data that were available showed that unsubstituted_benzyl at r and an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 were comparable to if not better than any other_substituents tested

for example dr._kohn in his 1985 paper used unsubstituted_benzyl at r and unsubstituted_methyl at r1 as a` reference_point' and considered five possible_modifications of the unsubstituted_benzyl at r and three modifications of the unsubstituted_methyl at r1
id.at 506
with respect to the r_position only one of the five r modifications showed activity comparable to unsubstituted_benzyl at r. id
the others showed decreased activity
id
for the r1 position each of the three modifications decreased anticonvulsant_activity when compared to unsubstituted_methyl
id

dr._kohn also considered in his 1990 paper the effect of replacing an unsubstituted_benzyl at r and found that placing a fluoro-substituted benzyl at r yielded only a comparable anticonvulsant effect
id
fluoro-substituted benzyl at r did however provide a` far superior' protective_index
id
yet this must be balanced against dr._kohns 1991 paper where all 26 compounds reported had unsubstituted_benzyl at r and unsubstituted_methyl at r1 explaining that` you get potent_protection if you have a benzyl on one end [ at r ] and a methyl on the other [ at r1 ]'
id
( emphasis added

thus the data that were available showed that unsubstituted_benzyl at r and an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 were comparable if not better than any other_substituents that were tested with respect to anticonvulsant_activity
despite the test that demonstrated fluoro-substituted benzyls` far superior' protective_index these tests provide strong evidence that a person of ordinary_skill would have a reasonable_expectation of success in selecting these substituents in order to create an faa having an anticonvulsant effect
this is especially so with respect to selecting unsubstituted_methyl for r1 as it was the most successful substituent tested
although these data might have shown that there was no guarantee that unsubstituted_benzyl at r would provide the greatest protective_index as compared to other possible substituents` only a reasonable_expectation *1335 of success not a guarantee is needed'
pfizer 480 f.3d at 1364

accordingly the district_court clearly erred when it found that the data specific to r and r1 that did exist at the time would not have led a person of ordinary_skill to place an unsubstituted_benzyl at r or an unsubstituted_methyl at r1

c. finally and perhaps most importantly the district_court erred when it did not consider the legall_thesis in its primary double-patenting analysis.2see district_court_opinion 201 f.supp.3d at 530-35
for purposes of this litigation the parties agree that the legall_thesis constitutes a` printed publication' within the meaning of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b3id.at 508

importantly the legall_thesis disclosed compound_107e which exactly like lacosamide has a methoxymethyl_group at r3 an unsubstituted_benzyl at r and an unsubstituted_methyl at r1
id
compound_107e is identical to lacosamide except that it contains both the r- and s-enantiomers in a mixture rather than just the r-enantiomer
id
although he did not have data for compound_107e legall hypothesized that structural_similarities between compound_107e and another compound for which he did have data 86b suggested that compound_107e` may have good_anticonvulsant_activity'
id.at 509

the legall_thesis is highly relevant to the obviousness_analysis
for example the majority concluded that` the trial_evidence supports the district_courts finding that there was no prior_art that would have provided a person of ordinary_skill_reason to believe that unsubstituted_benzyl and methyl would have been successful with a methoxymethyl_group'
majority op
1326
not so
the thesis disclosed a compound having like lacosamide a methoxymethyl_group at r3 together with an unsubstituted_benzyl at r and an unsubstituted_methyl at r1 and it provided a reasonable hypothesis based on structural_similarities to other compounds that this compound` may have good_anticonvulsant_activity'
district_court_opinion 201 f.supp.3d at 509
again` only a reasonable_expectation of success not a guarantee is needed'
pfizer 480 f.3d at 1364
thus to the extent the district_court found that there was no indication in the prior_art that benzyl and methyl would have been successful with a methoxymethyl_group it clearly erred

certainly this evidence especially when considered along with the other evidence before the district_court would have strongly contributed to a person of ordinary_skill in the arts having a reasonable_expectation of success in creating an faa with anticonvulsant_activity by selecting an unsubstituted_benzyl for r and an unsubstituted_methyl for r1

* * *

*1336 considering all of the evidence despite some supporting evidence identified by the district_court i am` left with the definite and firm_conviction' that the district_court made a mistake
id.at 1359 quoting u.s._gypsum 333 u.s. at 395 68_s.ct._525
thus i conclude that the district_court clearly erred in finding that one skilled in the art would not have had a reasonable_expectation of success with unsubstituted_benzyl at r and unsubstituted_methyl at r1
taking the district_courts clear_error together with the remainder of its fact_findings i would have concluded that claims 9 10 and 13 of the asserted551_patent are not patentably distinct from the reference_claims
thus i would reverse the district_courts conclusion and hold that the asserted_claims of the551_patent are invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting
i therefore respectfully dissent

anticonvulsant activity i.e. efficacy is determined based on ed50 which in legall represents the dose at which half of the animals tested did not have a convulsion
a lower ed50 value represents higher potency
conversely a higher ed50 value represents lower potency

as shown in the formula of claim 1 the551_patent uses` ar'` q' and` q1' to designate the location of substituent groups corresponding to the` r'` r1' and` r3' positions in the asserted art
for ease of comparison we use the r r1 and r3 designations in discussing corresponding substituents in lacosamide

we note that the uspto instituted an ex parte_reexamination and inter_partes review of the551_patent
while this appeal was pending the uspto issued its final written decision in the inter_partes review concluding that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that claims 1-13 of the551_patent would have been obvious over certain prior_art including kohn 1991 and the729_patent

the uspto also recently concluded its reexamination proceeding and confirmed that claims 9 10 and 13 are not unpatentable for obviousness-type_double_patenting over the301_patent kohn 1991 and the729_patent
the dissent contends that the uspto did not consider the legall_thesis in its reexamination
dissent op
1335 n.3
we note however that the uspto did consider legall and determined that legall was not prior_art because it was not publically accessible before the priority_date

additionally i find it significant that unsubstituted_benzyl and unsubstituted_methyl were most often used together at r and r1 respectively
in other_words they are presented throughout the prior_art as a pair
thus a person of ordinary_skill would not need to independently select benzyl for r and then separately select methyl for r1 as the district_court posited
2
the majority takes issue with my characterization of the district_courts opinion on this point
i do not mean to imply that the district_court did not make any findings of fact as to the legall_thesis
the court certainly did in its introductory` findings of fact' section
district_court_opinion 201 f.supp.3d at 508-09
but i maintain that the district_court determined in its primary double-patenting analysis that there was no reasonable_expectation of success without considering the teachings of this reference
a citation to two pages of dr._roushs trial_testimony stripped of any reference to the legall_thesis can not cure this deficiency

the majority in support of its conclusion notes that the uspto instituted an ex parte_reexamination of the551_patent and concluded that claims 9 10 and 13 were not unpatentable for obviousness-type_double_patenting over the301_patent kohn 1991 and the729_patent
crucially however the uspto did not institute trial as to grounds relying on the legall_thesis
