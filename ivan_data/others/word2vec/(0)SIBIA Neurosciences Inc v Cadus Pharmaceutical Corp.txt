cadus pharmaceutical corporation` cadus' appeals the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of california entered after a jury_verdict finding the patent_claims at issue infringed and not invalid and assessing damages of $ 18 million
because we determine that the asserted claims are obvious as a matter of law we reverse

background
the identification of compounds that bind with particular_cell_surface_proteins is useful in the search for new_drugs
when such binding occurs a cascade of biochemical events is activated within the cell in which a linkage known as a signal_transduction_pathway is formed between the cell_surface_protein and a gene in the cells dna
this linkage allows the cell to respond to signals from the external_environment which is critical for the cell to properly function
compounds that activate this linkage often prove useful in pharmaceutical applications because many diseases stem from the malfunctioning of cellular communications

*1352 in general when a compound activates a signal_transduction_pathway the cell responds by directing the production or non-production of a protein from a responsive gene in the dna
protein production involves two distinct processes-transcription and translation
transcription refers to the process by which a strand of messenger rna` mrna' is created by the expression of a gene
translation refers to the process by which a corresponding_protein i.e. a sequence of amino acids is created from the mrna
compounds that trigger or enhance transcription and translation are referred to as agonists and compounds that block or decrease such activity are called antagonists
the displaying of agonist and antagonist_activity is an indication that a compound has bound with the cell_surface_protein and has activated the signal_transduction_pathway

sibia_neurosciences inc.` sibia' is the owner of u.s._patent_no._5401,629` the629_patent` which is directed to a cell-based screening_method useful for the identification of compounds that exhibit agonist and antagonist_activity with respect to particular_cell_surface_proteins
according to the patent the claimed methods are particularly effective because they allow a scientist to rapidly and reliably screen large numbers of compounds for agonist and antagonist_activity
see629_patent col._1,_ll._45-50
thus the scientist could quickly develop a list of candidate compounds that merit further in-depth_studies for therapeutic_applications
see id
claim 1 the only independent claim reads as follows 1
a method for identifying_compounds that modulate_cell_surface_protein-mediated activity by detecting intracellular_transduction of a signal generated upon interaction of the compound with the cell_surface_protein comprising comparing the amount of transcription of a reporter_gene or the amount of reporter_gene_product expressed in a first_recombinant_cell in the presence of the compound with the amount of transcription or product in the absence of the compound or with the amount of transcription or product in a second_recombinant_cell ; and
selecting compounds that change the amount of transcription of a reporter_gene or the amount of reporter_gene_product expressed in the first_recombinant_cell in the presence of the compound compared to the amount of transcription or product in the absence of the compound or compared to the amount of transcription or product in the second_recombinant_cell wherein the cell_surface_protein is a surface receptor or ion_channel ; the first_recombinant_cell contains a reporter_gene_construct and expresses the cell_surface_protein ; the second_recombinant_cell is identical to the first_recombinant_cell except that it does not express the cell_surface_protein ; and
the reporter_gene_construct contains a a transcriptional_control_element that is responsive to the intracellular signal that is generated by the interaction of an agonist with the cell_surface_protein ; and
( b a reporter_gene that encodes a detectable transcriptional or translational product and that is in operative association with the transcriptional_control_element
see id. col._13,_l._44- col._14,_l._12

the methods claimed in the629_patent utilize a recombinant_cell that is exposed to various compounds in order to determine whether those compounds exhibit the desired activity
this recombinant_cell in addition to the host cell itself has two basic components a heterologous1 cell_surface_protein and a reporter_gene_construct
the cell_surface_protein can be either an ion_channel or a cell_surface_receptor
ion channels are proteins that act as pores in the cell membrane and allow small inorganic ions to flow in or out *1353 of the cell
these ion_channels open and close based on interaction with certain external compounds
cell surface receptors on the other_hand are proteins that span the external membrane of the cell and bind with particular molecules to commence a chain of intracellular reactions that transmit external signals to the dna
as described above cell_surface_proteins are physiologically important because they play a vital role in the stimulation of signal_transduction_pathways and thus the cells ability to respond appropriately to stimuli from the external_environment

the second major component of the cell utilized in the629_patent is the reporter_gene_construct which consists of a transcriptional_control_element and a reporter_gene
the transcriptional_control_element is a gene that reacts to the signal from the cell_surface_protein and regulates transcription of the reporter_gene
the reporter_gene through the processes of transcription and translation creates a corresponding_protein referred to as` reporter_gene_product'
both transcription of the reporter_gene and translation to the reporter_gene_product can be measured

in the claimed methods this recombinant_cell is used in a battery of assays the goal of which is to determine if a given compound exhibits the desired binding activity with respect to a particular_cell_surface_protein
the method of claim 1 contains two assays
in the first assay referred to as the` compound/no compound assay' the recombinant_cell is exposed to a test_compound
the amount of reporter_gene_transcription or reporter_gene_product expressed in that recombinant_cell is then compared to the amount of reporter_gene_transcription or reporter_gene_product expressed in a recombinant_cell that was not exposed to the test_compound
in the second assay known as the` receptor/no receptor assay' two recombinant_cells are exposed to a test_compound
however one of the recombinant_cells has a cell_surface_protein but the other does not
the amount of reporter_gene_transcription or reporter_gene_product expressed in both of these cells is then compared
based on these measurements the scientist is able to detect whether the compound has bound to the cell_surface_protein and modulated the signal_transduction_pathway
this in turn allows the scientist to determine whether the compound is a candidate for further study or should be excluded from consideration

sibia sued cadus for infringement of the629_patent
the court held a markman_hearing see markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 979 34_uspq2d_1321 1329 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996) and issued an order construing numerous claim terms including` identifying_compounds'` cell'` recombinant_cell'` comparing the amount'` identical' and` selecting compounds'
only the construction of` cell'` identifying_compounds' and` selecting compounds' are relevant to this appeal
before the district_court cadus argued that because the claims use the term` cell' without modification this term should refer to all cells eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic.2 alternatively cadus argued that if` cell' should be limited to less than all cells it should be limited to only mammalian_cells because the examples found in the written description of the patent only discuss mammalian_cells
the court decided however that because the patentee describes the cells used in the claimed methods as` eukaryotic_cells' in the written description see629_patent col._3,_ll._52-56 col._4,_ll._9-11 a person of ordinary_skill in the art would interpret cell as found in the claim_language to mean only_eukaryotic_cells

also important to this appeal is the courts construction of the phrases` identifying_compounds' and` selecting compounds'
*1354 at the markman_hearing the parties disagreed as to whether this claim_language required the compounds to be unknown to interact with the particular_cell_surface_protein prior to conducting the assays or whether these terms include both compounds known and unknown to interact with the cell_surface_proteins
the court held that the ordinary meaning of` identifying_compounds' is determining which compounds interact with a particular_cell_surface_protein from a group of compounds with unknown properties
thus the testing of compounds that are known to interact with a particular_cell_surface_protein does not fall within the ambit of` identifying_compounds'
similarly the court held that` selecting compounds' referred only to choosing compounds from a group previously unknown to interact with a cell_surface_protein based on the results of the reporter_gene_transcription and translation analyses

the case then proceeded to a jury trial
at trial cadus asserted that the claims of the629_patent were invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a or as not enabled under ¡± 112 ?
1
with regard to obviousness cadus asserted that the claims of the629_patent would have been obvious in view of deborah j. stumpo et al. identification of c-fos sequences involved in induction by insulin and phorbol esters 263 j
biological chem
1611 feb.1988` stumpo' alone given the knowledge in the art as embodied in the review article by henry a. lester heterologous expression of excitability proteins route to more specific drugs ? 241_science_1057_(aug.1988)` lester'
additionally cadus asserted that the claims would have been obvious in view of stumpo in combination with william s. chen et al. requirement for intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase in the immediate and late action of the egf receptor 328_nature_820_(aug.1987)` chen' and ronald mark evans et al. hormone receptor compositions and methods wo 88/03168 may 1988` evans'
with regard to non-enablement cadus claimed that if` cell' is to be interpreted to broadly include all eukaryotic_cells the claims are not enabled because the written description discloses only how to practice the invention using mammalian_cells
the jury returned a verdict in favor of sibia finding that cadus infringed claims 1 2 4-7 9 10 12 and 14 of the629_patent
the jury rejected caduss invalidity defenses of obviousness and non-enablement
damages based on the calculation of a` reasonable royalty' were assessed at $ 18 million
cadus filed numerous post-trial motions including motions for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' or a new_trial on the issues of infringement and invalidity and motions for remittitur or a new_trial for damages
all of caduss motions were denied
this appeal followed

discussion
a
standard of review
we review the denial of a motion for jmol following a jury_verdict by reapplying the district_courts standard of review
see tec_air inc. v. denso mfg. 192_f.3d_1353 1357 52_uspq2d_1294 1296 fed.cir.1999
thus we review issues of law de novo
with regard to factual findings we must presume that the jury resolved all factual_disputes in favor of the prevailing party and we must leave those findings undisturbed as long as they are supported by substantial_evidence
see jurgens v. mckasy 927_f.2d_1552 1557 18_uspq2d_1031 1035 fed.cir.1991

a factual finding is supported by substantial_evidence if a reasonable_jury could have found in favor of the prevailing party in light of the evidence presented at trial
see tec_air 192 f.3d at 1358 52 uspq2d at 1296 ; see also consolidated edison co. v. nlrb 305_u.s._197 229 59_s.ct._206 83_l.ed._126_(1938)` substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla
it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion`
thus substantial_evidence review involves an examination of the record as a whole taking into consideration *1355 evidence that both justifies and detracts from the decision of the fact-finder
see in re gartside 203_f.3d_1305 1312 53_uspq2d_1769 1773 fed.cir.2000 ; national presto indus. inc. v. west bend co. 76_f.3d_1185 1192 37_uspq2d_1685 1690 fed.cir.1996 holding that a jury_verdict must be sustained if it is supported by substantial_evidence based on a review of the entirety of the record
in reviewing the record we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the prevailing party and not make credibility determinations or substitute our view of the conflicting evidence for that of the jury
see connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 1546 220_uspq_193 197 fed.cir.1983
if however after reviewing all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party this court is convinced that a reasonable_jury could not have found in that partys favor we must reverse the denial of jmol

b. obviousness
the first step in any invalidity analysis is claim_construction an issue of law that this court reviews de novo
see cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1456 46_uspq2d_1169 1174 fed.cir.1998 en banc
in this appeal the key issues of claim_construction are largely undisputed
as described in more detail above the method of claim 1 utilizes a recombinant_cell having both a heterologous_cell_surface_protein and a reporter_gene_construct
this cell is used in two assays-the compound/no compound assay and the receptor/no receptor assay-in which compounds are` identified' and` selected'
neither party disputes that the terms` identifying_compounds' and` selecting compounds' limit the claimed method to identifying and selecting compounds that are not previously known to interact with a particular_cell_surface_protein
the only remaining claim_construction issue on appeal is the proper interpretation of the term` cell'
according to cadus the court erred by limiting` cell' to only_eukaryotic_cells as opposed to all cells both eukaryotic and prokaryotic
sibia defends the district_courts interpretation by pointing to certain passages in the written description that it asserts support the district_courts narrower claim_construction
see comark communications inc. v. harris corp. 156_f.3d_1182 1186 48_uspq2d_1001 1005 fed.cir.1998 discussing the` fine line' between reading a claim in light of the written description and reading a limitation into the claim from the written description
however because we decide that the claim is obvious even under the district_courts narrow construction of the term` cell' we need not decide whether the court erroneously imported the` eukaryotic' limitation into the claim or simply interpreted the claim in light of the specification
thus we can proceed to the question of obviousness accepting the district_courts construction of claim 1

a patent claim is invalid` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 1994
while the ultimate_conclusion of obviousness is for the court to decide as a matter of law several factual inquiries underlie this determination
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
these inquiries include the scope and content of the prior_art the level of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and any objective_evidence of non-obviousness such as long-felt need and commercial_success
see id
because an issued patent is presumed valid there must be clear and convincing evidence supporting the obviousness_determination
see kahn v. general motors corp. 135_f.3d_1472 1480 45_uspq2d_1608 1614 fed.cir.1998
while the presentation at trial of a reference that was not before the examiner does not change the presumption of validity the alleged infringers burden *1356 may be more easily carried because of this additional reference
see applied materials inc. v. advanced semiconductor materials am. inc. 98_f.3d_1563 1569 40_uspq2d_1481 1485 fed.cir.1996

on appeal cadus argues that the stumpo_reference alone which was not before the pto examiner is sufficient to invalidate the patent under ¡± 103 given the level of skill in the art at the time of the invention
in appropriate circumstances a single prior_art_reference can render a claim obvious
see e.g. b.f._goodrich co. v. aircraft_braking_sys corp. 72_f.3d_1577 1582 37_uspq2d_1314 1318 fed.cir.1996 ; in re o'farrell 853_f.2d_894 902 7_uspq2d_1673 1680 fed.cir.1988
however there must be a showing of a suggestion or motivation to modify the teachings of that reference to the claimed invention in order to support the obviousness_conclusion
see b.f._goodrich 72 f.3d at 1582 37 uspq2d at 1318
this suggestion or motivation may be derived from the prior_art_reference itself see o'farrell 853 f.2d at 902 7 uspq2d at 1680 from the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art or from the nature of the problem to be solved
see pro-mold & tool_co. v. great lakes plastics inc. 75_f.3d_1568 1573 37_uspq2d_1626 1630 fed.cir.1996 ; see also motorola inc. v. interdigital tech corp. 121_f.3d_1461 1472 43_uspq2d_1481 1489 fed.cir.1997` [ t ] he suggestion to combine may come from the prior_art as filtered through the knowledge of one skilled in the art`
determining whether there is a suggestion or motivation to modify a prior_art_reference is one aspect of determining the scope and content of the prior_art a fact question subsidiary to the ultimate_conclusion of obviousness
see tec_air inc. 192 f.3d at 1359 52 uspq2d at 1298 stating that the factual_underpinnings of obviousness include whether a reference provides a motivation to combine its teachings with another
because the jury returned a verdict in favor of sibia we must presume that all factual_disputes such as the motivation to modify were resolved in its favor
see jurgens 927 f.2d at 1557 18 uspq2d at 1035

the parties are in general agreement regarding the teachings of the stumpo_paper itself
stumpo describes recombinant_cells engineered to have both a heterologous_cell_surface_receptor and a responsive reporter_gene_construct
these cells are identical to the recombinant_cells used in the claimed methods
stumpo describes using these cells in a transcription-based assay in order to detect cell_surface_receptor activation
according to the unrebutted testimony of dr._struhl the stumpo_paper described a` straightforward_functional_assay' for analyzing the response of a particular_cell_surface_protein in the presence of a compound
however these transcription-based assays use the compound insulin which was known to interact with the surface receptors of stumpos recombinant_cells
the purpose of these assays was not drug_screening but the characterization of certain aspects of the genetic_material of the recombinant_cell
claim 1 of the629_patent on the other_hand claims a method using recombinant_cells identical to stumpos in transcription-based assays with compounds not previously known to interact with the cell_surface_protein of the recombinant_cell
the only difference between the experiments described in the stumpo_paper and claim 1 is that in the stumpo_paper the compounds are known to interact with the cell_surface_proteins while in claim 1 they are not
thus we must presume that the jury determined that there was no motivation to modify the stumpo_reference such that the cells described therein would be utilized with compounds that were not previously known to interact with the cell_surface_proteins
see id
we hold that this key factual finding is not supported by substantial_evidence

as discussed above the motivation to modify a reference can come from the knowledge of those skilled in the art from the prior_art_reference itself or from the nature of the problem to be solved
see *1357 in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1358 47_uspq2d_1453 1458 fed.cir.1998
the undisputed evidence indicates that there was a motivation to modify stumpo
it was known in the art at the time of the invention that cells with heterologous_cell_surface_proteins were ideal_candidates for drug_screening_methods
the lester_review_article describes the widespread use of such cells in the identification of new_drugs a new approach for a systematic program to develop more specific drugs has simultaneously occurred to several investigators
this approach is based on the expression of excitability_molecules3 from dna clones in cells that readily support such expression and can readily be studied with the full range of modern physiological and pharmacological techniques

lester 241 science at 1058
lester goes on to describe that drug_screening_methods utilizing the expression of excitability_molecules i.e. cell_surface_receptors can overcome the` highly empirical approach to the design of drugs' and the lack of functional assays for determining which compounds act on which cell_surface_receptors
id.at 1062
these are the identical problems that were being addressed by the629_patent
see629_patent col._1,_ll._36-44` the availability of rapid effective means to identify compounds which interact with.. cell surface-localized receptors would enable the rapid screening of a large number of compounds to identify those candidates suitable for further in-depth_studies of therapeutic_applications`
similarly the prior_art dull patent u.s. patent no._4859,609 teaches a drug_screening_method using cells that had a cell_surface_receptor
thus the express_teaching in the prior_art was that cells having heterologous_cell_surface_proteins a characteristic found in the stumpo_cells have been successfully used in drug_screening_methods and were in fact ideal_candidates for such use
additionally the undisputed testimony was that stumpo provided a` straightforward_functional_assay' for determining the response of the heterologous_cell_surface_protein when exposed to a compound
given that the nature of the problem was the development of rapid and effective drug_screening_methods based on the response of a heterologous_cell_surface_protein these teachings provide the motivation to modify stumpo

in response to these teachings sibia merely points out that the cells described in the lester article and the dull patent are not described as having reporter_gene_constructs like those used in the629_patent and found in the stumpo_cells
sibia however is confusing obviousness with anticipation
it is true that these references do not contain an express_teaching to use a cell identical to that taught by stumpo in a drug_screening_method
it is equally true that these references particularly lester teach that cells with heterologous_cell_surface_receptors were known in the art to have been successfully used in drug_screening_methods and that the stumpo_cells have such heterologous_cell_surface_receptors
sibias response that lester does not mention cells that contain a reporter_gene_construct in addition to the heterologous_cell_surface_receptor is to no avail absent some evidence that this additional characteristic would have made such a cell a less attractive candidate for drug_screening_methods
see in re gurley 27_f.3d_551 553 31_uspq2d_1130 1131 fed.cir.1994` [ a ] reference will teach away if it suggests that the line of development flowing from the references disclosures is unlikely to be productive of the result sought by the applicant`
sibia makes no allegation of a teaching away in lester
to the contrary the evidence is unrebutted that cells with reporter_gene_constructs were also known in the art to be useful in drug_screening_methods
see u.s._patent_no._5091,518 to sucov.4 *1358 thus these undisputed teachings in the prior_art` as filtered through the knowledge of one skilled in the art' motorola 121 f.3d at 1472 43 uspq2d at 1489 as well as the nature of the problem to be solved provide a suggestion and motivation to use the stumpo_cells which have heterologous_cell_surface_receptors in drug_screening_methods

sibia asserts that regardless of these express_teachings supporting the suggestion to modify stumpo various trial testimony provides the substantial_evidence on which the jurys implied finding of no motivation to modify can be supported
sibia relies heavily on the testimony of drs
wall struhl and blackshear
dr. wall testified that the stumpo_paper contained no mention of drug_screening and that the experiments described in that paper were directed to the characterization of the fos gene not to a drug_screening_method
wall also testified that the stumpo_paper would not immediately lead one to` conduct drug_screening'
similarly dr._struhl testified that there was no indication that the researchers involved in the experiments described in stumpo used the cells for drug_screening
however simply pointing out that the stumpo_reference itself does not teach the modification is not substantial_evidence of no motivation to modify given the express_teaching of the prior_art
sibias reliance on the testimony of wall and struhl ignores the possibility that the motivation to modify stumpo can be found outside the reference itself
see id
thus while stumpo does not expressly suggest that the cells described therein could be used in drug_screening_methods the knowledge of those skilled in the art in particular as embodied in the lester_review_article suggests this modification
sibia also points to the testimony of dr. blackshear the senior author of stumpo who testified that the stumpo_paper does not contain any reference to drug_screening and at the time those experiments were conducted` drug_screening was not on our minds'
however this testimony in itself does not provide substantial_evidence in support of the jurys finding
at the time of these experiments blackshear was focused on the problem of determining the` fundamental biochemical mechanisms by which insulin worked'
blackshears personal efforts were limited to a problem different than that addressed by the629_patent
thus the testimony that he was not thinking about drug_screening is irrelevant to the fundamental issue of whether the hypothetical person of ordinary_skill in the art when confronted with the problem of developing drug_screening_methods would have been motivated to use the stumpo_cells in such methods
see pro-mold & tool_co. 75 f.3d at 1573 37 uspq2d at 1630 discussing the importance of considering the problem to be solved in the obviousness_determination ; see also in re rinehart 531_f.2d_1048 1054 189_uspq_143 149 ccpa 1976 same

finally sibia_points to secondary_considerations in support of the jurys verdict
in particular sibia_points to three licenses or sub-licenses of the629_patent all of which were part of larger licensing packages
however the mere existence of these licenses is insufficient to overcome the conclusion of obviousness as based on the express_teachings in the prior_art that would have motivated one of ordinary_skill to modify stumpos cells to be used with unknown_compounds
see newell cos. v. kenney mfg co. 864_f.2d_757 769 9_uspq2d_1417 1426 fed.cir.1988 holding that because the record established such a strong case of obviousness based on the teachings of the prior_art the fact that the product was successful does not overcome the conclusion of obviousness
moreover sibia has failed to point to any evidence establishing a nexus between the licensing activity and the merits of the claimed screening_method
see *1359 in re gpac inc. 57_f.3d_1573 1580 35_uspq2d_1116 1121 fed.cir.1995` for objective_evidence to be accorded substantial weight its proponent must establish a nexus between the evidence and the merits of the claimed invention`
thus sibias reliance on secondary_considerations in support of the jury_verdict must fail

in sum the undisputed teaching of the stumpo_paper leads one to within a hairsbreadth of anticipation of claim 1 of the629_patent
the express_teachings in the art provide the motivation and suggestion to modify stumpo such that the recombinant_cells described therein should be used with compounds not previously known to interact with them for purposes of drug_screening
sibia the jury_verdict winner has failed to point to any substantial_evidence to refute these express_teachings even under the deferential standard with which this court reviews jury_verdicts
thus claim 1 must be invalidated on the basis of obviousness

c. dependent claims
in addition to finding claim 1 infringed and not invalid the jury found dependent_claims 2 4-7 9 10 12 and 14 infringed and not invalid as well
however in this appeal sibia has failed to argue the validity of the dependent_claims separately from the validity of claim 1
thus these claims do not stand on their own and given our determination that claim 1 is invalid the remaining dependent_claims must fall as well
see mehl/biophile int l corp. v. milgraum 192_f.3d_1362 1367 52_uspq2d_1303 1307 fed.cir.1999 ; gardner v. tec sys inc. 725_f.2d_1338 1350 220_uspq_777 786 fed.cir.1984 en banc holding that dependent_claims fall with the independent claim on which they depend unless argued separately

conclusion
we conclude that the implicit finding by the jury that there was no suggestion or motivation to modify the stumpo_reference is unsupported by substantial_evidence and the asserted claims are obvious as a matter of law
therefore the district_courts denial of the caduss motion for jmol on the issue of invalidity must be

mayer chief_judge dissenting
today the court overrides a jury_verdict of infringement based on a tenuous obviousness analysis
it recognizes that the stumpo_paper only refers to the use of known substances and presumes that to find infringement the jury must have implicitly found that there was no motivation in stumpo to utilize the disclosed cells with compounds not previously known to interact with the cell_surface_proteins
based on the state of knowledge in the art that cells with heterologous_cell_surface_proteins were ideal_candidates for drug_screening_methods the court then concludes that the jurys implicit finding is not supported by substantial_evidence

in reality the court relies on the combination of stumpo lester and sucov to establish that the use of heterologous cells with reporter_gene_constructs was known in the art to be useful in drug_screening_methods
stumpo discloses cells identical to the 629 patent_claims but does not mention their use to test unknown_compounds as possible drugs
lester describes the utility of heterologous_cell_surface_proteins for drug testing but does not mention cells with reporter_gene_constructs which are central to the method of testing of the 629 claims
sucov was not even argued at trial where cadus argued that either stumpo or chen renders the 629 patent obvious
this analysis is inconsistent with the courts stated conclusion that the 629 patent is obvious over the stumpo_reference alone in view of the prior_art as argued by cadus
it fails to recognize that the 629 patent includes only method claims ; sibia disclaimed all claims *1360 to the cells themselves when stumpo was brought to its attention

the court is making an end-run around the requirement that there must be a motivation to modify the reference along the path taken by the 629 patent
see kolmes v. world fibers corp. 107_f.3d_1534 1541 41_uspq2d_1829 1833 fed.cir.1997 invention was not obvious where there was no suggestion or motivation to modify teaching of reference
it combines a series of references not specifically argued to the jury to conclude that no reasonable_jury could possibly find the absence of motivation in the prior_art to modify the stumpo_paper to render the 629 patent obvious
without citing any motivation to modify in any of the series of references the court improperly concludes that it would have been unreasonable for the jury to find as a matter of fact that there was no such motivation
see tec_air inc. v. denso mfg
michigan inc. 192_f.3d_1353 1359 52_uspq2d_1294 1297-98 fed.cir.1999 whether a reference provides a motivation to combine its teachings with other references is a question of fact underlying the legal determination of nonobviousness that we assume the jury resolved in favor of the verdict winner and leave undisturbed if it is supported by substantial_evidence
)

the district_court properly rejected cadus motion for judgment as a matter of law holding that there was substantial_evidence to support a verdict of nonobviousness because the 629 patent was a combination of factors that was not apparent to a person of ordinary_skill in the art
the trial court found additional support for the jurys verdict in evidence of secondary_considerations of long-felt need and commercial_success of the 629 patent
these are factual_underpinnings of the legal conclusion of nonobviousness that the jury presumptively resolved in favor of sibia because substantial_evidence supported them
see id. 192_f.3d_1353 52 uspq2d at 1298

this court improperly rejects this substantial_evidence
it opens the door for accused infringers to string together a series of references which collectively contain the elements of an apparatus here the cell with a heterologous_cell_surface_protein and reporter_gene_construct and various suggestions for the use of those separate references
it then would allow an inference of motivation to modify a single_reference to render obvious a method claim for utilizing the apparatus
all this is in violation of the well-settled mandate requiring a motivation to alter a single_reference or to combine multiple_references to render the claims of a patent obvious
see e.g. id.at 1359 192_f.3d_1353 52 uspq2d at 1298 motivation to combine multiple_references ; b.f._goodrich v. aircraft_braking_sys corp. 72_f.3d_1577 1582 37_uspq2d_1314 1318 fed.cir.1996 motivation to modify a single_reference ; grain processing corp. v. american maize-products co. 840_f.2d_902 907 5_uspq2d_1788 1792 fed.cir.1988` care must be taken to avoid hindsight_reconstruction by usingthe patent in suit as a guide through the maze of prior_art_references combining the right references in the right way so as to achieve the result of the claims in suit
`` internal citation omitted ; in re fine 837_f.2d_1071 1075 5_uspq2d_1596 1600 fed.cir.1988` one can not use hindsight_reconstruction to pick and choose among isolated disclosures in the prior_art to deprecate the claimed invention`
the court has substituted itself for the jury reweighed the evidence and combined references that were not before the jury
i would sustain the jurys verdict
