re
36,355` the ¡¬355_patent` appeals from the district_courts judgment of noninfringement of claim 5 and its dependent_claims and claim 10 in favor of conagra_foods inc.` conagra'
conagra_cross-appeals from the district_courts judgment that the patent_claims are not invalid
we affirm in all respects

background
the patent in this case relates to breadmaking
oxidizing agents are used during the breadmaking_process to strengthen dough increase loaf_volume contribute to fine_crumb_grain and increase shelf life
since the early 1900s potassium_bromate was widely used as a slow-acting oxidant to improve the quality of bread
however by the 1990s there was growing concern about the carcinogenic effects of potassium_bromate and the food and drug administration encouraged the baking industry to seek suitable alternatives
kim a food chemist believed that a combination of ascorbic_acid and food_acid would serve as a suitable alternative to potassium_bromate in the breadmaking_process and applied for a patent on that composition
on april_23,_1996 kim obtained u.s._patent_no._5510,129 for a potassium_bromate_replacer_composition
however a few weeks later kim surrendered that patent to the patent and trademark office` pto' and filed a reissue_application alleging that an error had arisen during prosecution
after prosecution of her reissue_application kim obtained the ¡¬355 reissue patent on october 26 1999

on april_9,_2001 kim filed suit against conagra alleging that conagra induced the infringement of independent_claims 5_and_10 of the reissued ¡¬355_patent1 claims 5_and_10 were newly added during prosecution of the reissue_application
the accused conduct was that conagra required licensees of its` healthy_choicethe_r' brand name to use recipes provided by conagra
kim alleged that the healthy_choicethe_r natural wheat product infringed claim 5 and that the healthy_choicethe_r 7-grain and whole_grain_products infringed claim 10.2 conagra stipulated *1317 that the bread recipes used in the accused products included ascorbic_acid and food_acid in the ranges specified in claims 5_and_10 of the ¡¬355_patent
claim 10 differs from claim 5 in that it contains the additional_limitation of yeast

on june_30,_2003 conagra filed a counterclaim for a declaratory_judgment of invalidity and noninfringement of the ¡¬355_patent3 on november 10 2003 conagra moved for summary judgment of invalidity based on the recapture_rule
on march_26,_2004 the district_court judge william t. hart denied conagras motion
the case then proceeded to trial
after each partys case-in-chief the opposing party moved for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' under rule 50 of the federal rules of civil procedure and the district_court reserved ruling on both motions
on october 13 2004 a jury found that the asserted claims of the ¡¬355_patent were not invalid ; that conagra had induced infringement of claim 10 with the licensing of its healthy choice the_r 7-grain and whole_grain_products but that the inducement was not willful ; and that claim 5 and the dependent_claims were not infringed
conagra renewed its motion for jmol arguing invalidity and noninfringement
on april_28,_2005 the district_court partially granted conagras motion for jmol finding that the ¡¬355_patent was not invalid but that claim 10 was not infringed
the district_court entered final_judgment on april_28,_2005 finding the ¡¬355_patent not infringed and not invalid

kim timely appealed the judgment of noninfringement and conagra_cross-appealed the judgment that the claims were not invalid
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 2000

discussion
i. kim urges that we 1 reverse the district_courts grant of jmol of noninfringement of claim 10 2 overturn the jurys verdict of noninfringement of claim 5 and 3 find both claims 5_and_10 willfully infringed by conagra

kim contends that the jury charge rested on an incorrect construction of the phrase` [ a ] potassium_bromate_replacer_composition' in both claims 5_and_10 of the ¡¬355_patent4 alternatively kim argues that even under the district_courts claim_construction the accused products infringed

a claim construction
as part of its claim_construction the district_court instructed the jury that` [ t ] o infringe one of the claims of the ¡¬355_patent a bread must a contain ingredients in the proportions in claim 5 6 7 8 or 10 and b in that particular bread the ingredients must act as a potassium_bromate_replacer that is the ingredients must perform essentially the same_function in the production of that bread as would potassium_bromate'
j.a.at 113 emphasis added
*1318 the court also provided the jury with the following definition` potassium bromate is a slow_acting_oxidant once commonly used in the breadmaking_process
its function in the breadmaking_process is to strengthen the dough increase loaf_volume and contribute to fine_crumb_grain'
j.a.at 147 emphasis added
kim objected to these jury_instructions
on appeal kim concedes that` potassium_bromate_replacer' is a claim_limitation but argues that a` potassium_bromate_replacer' is simply a` potassium_bromate_substitute' which she in turns describes as a composition that is present when potassium_bromate is not

upon review of the specification we agree with the district_courts claim_construction
`` [ c ] laims must be read in view of the specification of which they are a part'
phillips v. awh_corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1315 fed.cir.2005 en banc internal_quotation_marks omitted
the specification` is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term'
id
( internal_quotation_marks omitted
here while the specification does not explicitly define the term` potassium_bromate_replacer' it does make clear that the claimed potassium_bromate_replacer is an oxidizing_agent
in fact the specification explicitly states that` the potassium_bromate_replacer provided in the present_invention is a more effective_oxidant than potassium_bromate'
¡¬355_patent col._3,_ll._1-2
the specification also describes oxidants or oxidizing_agents as follows oxidizing agents provide strengthening of dough during the manufacturing_process of yeast-leavening products
as a result oxidizing_agents are used to provide greater_loaf_volume improve internal_characteristics such as grain and texture and enhance symmetry and keeping quality of yeast-leavening products
¡¬355_patent col._1,_ll._22-27

thus the specification reveals that the claimed potassium_bromate_replacer functions as an oxidant and that oxidants strengthen dough increase loaf_volume and contribute to fine_crumb_grain
the specification also states that` the present_invention is particularly useful [ in ] that it provides natural ascorbic_acid as the only oxidizing_agent in dough that is effective and functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process'
¡¬355_patent col._1,_ll._57-60 emphasis added
when the claim_limitation is read against this backdrop it is clear that the potassium_bromate_replacer must be functional
the district_courts construction of` potassium_bromate_replacer' as a composition that performs essentially the same_function in the production of bread as would potassium_bromate by strengthening the dough increasing loaf_volume and contributing to fine_crumb_grain is therefore supported by the specification
we thus find no error in the district_courts construction of` potassium_bromate_replacer_composition
`` 5

*1319 we also agree with the district_courts determination that` there is no indication that the three [ potassium_bromate_replacer ingredients ] must first be combined together to form a stand-alone replacer composition and then be added as a whole to the bread_mix or dough'
j.a.at 206
we see nothing in the ¡¬355_patent which supports conagras argument for a contrary claim_construction

relying on various references in the specification and prosecution_history which describe kims potassium_bromate_replacer as functioning as a slow_acting_oxidant the dissent urges that` potassium_bromate_replacer' should be construed as` a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process'
diss
op.at 2
neither party urged this construction in the district_court or in this court
while we may have the authority to adopt claim_constructions which have not been proposed by either party see exxon chem patents inc. v. lubrizol corp. 64_f.3d_1553 1556 fed.cir.1995 we should be hesitant to do so
considering the dissents proposed construction on the merits we find it to be incorrect
the mere fact that one object of the invention is to produce a slow_acting_oxidant which is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process does not mean that this particular feature was adopted as a limitation in each claim of the patent
the specification does not require that the potassium_bromate_replacer must necessarily be a slow_acting_oxidant only that particular potassium_bromate_replacers perform that function
¡¬355_patent col. 2. ll
25-33
thus the fact that the patent here discloses the advantages of a slow_acting_oxidant does not mean that all the claims are directed to such an oxidant
see e-pass tech. inc. v. 3com corp. 343_f.3d_1364 1368-69 fed.cir.2003
indeed kim chose to claim a` slow acting' oxidant in dependent_claim 7 while her independent_claims were directed to a more general potassium_bromate_replacer
the doctrine of claim differentiation suggests that the independent_claims here should not include explicit limitations of a dependent_claim
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1315` [ t ] he presence of a dependent_claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent_claim
`` ; liebel-flarsheim co. v. medrad inc. 358_f.3d_898 910 fed.cir.2004
the prosecution_history does not compel a different construction

b infringement
kim argues in the alternative that even under the district_courts claim_construction conagra induced infringement and therefore the district_court erroneously granted jmol of noninfringement of claim 10
`` a finding of inducement requires both an underlying instance of direct infringement and a requisite showing of intent'
fuji photo film co. v. jazz photo corp. 394_f.3d_1368 1377 fed.cir.2005

it was undisputed that the accused products included the amount of ascorbic_acid food_acid and yeast in the proportions listed in claim 10
the question was whether the claimed ingredients in the accused products satisfied the functionality limitations
kims evidence of infringement on the question of functionality was by analogy
she testified that her patented_composition strengthened dough increased loaf_volume and contributed to fine_crumb_grain
since the accused products included the same ingredients as the patented_composition kim simply assumed that they had the same effects on dough as did the patented_composition

however with respect to a` consisting essentially of' claim there is no infringement where the accused product contains additional unclaimed ingredients *1320 that materially affect the basic and novel properties of the invention
see ppg indus
v. guardian indus corp. 156_f.3d_1351 1354 fed.cir.1998
here conagras 7-grain and whole wheat products contained additional_ingredients beyond ascorbic and food_acids such as vital wheat glutten ferrous sulfate and dough strengthening enzymes
based on testimony of its expert witness conagra argued that the additional_ingredients materially affected functionality
while kim who was qualified as an expert,6 offered conclusory_testimony that the additional_ingredients would not have materially affected the pertinent_characteristics of the bread kim did not support this determination with any examinations or tests of the actual accused products
under the circumstances of this case we agree with the district_court that kim did not prove infringement because she presented no testimony based on the accused products themselves that supported a finding of infringement
we thus agree that the district_court properly granted jmol to conagra on claim 10

regarding claim 5 kim argues that the jury erroneously found noninfringement
kim again relied on the fact that the accused natural wheat product contained the ingredients in the proportions specified under claim 5 and that her patented potassium_bromate_replacer as set forth in claim 5 strengthened dough
however kim again did not conduct any test based on the accused product to determine whether those ingredients had the required effect
the jurys verdict of noninfringement of claim 5 was therefore supported by substantial_evidence.7

having concluded that conagra did not induce infringement of claim 5 or claim 10 there is no need to address kims argument on willfulness.8

ii
in its cross-appeal conagra argues that the asserted claims of the ¡¬ 355 patent are invalid because they improperly recapture material that kim surrendered during prosecution of her original_patent and that the ¡¬355_patent is invalid as anticipated by and obvious over the prior_art.9

a recapture of surrendered subject matter
understanding conagras recapture argument requires that we first review the prosecution_history of the ¡¬355_patent
on november 5 1993 kim filed her original_patent application for a composition and process for controlling the oxidation rate of ascorbic_acid in breadmaking
in pertinent *1321 part claims 1-5 of this application were directed to a composition including an unspecified amount of ascorbic_acid and 0.03-0.2 parts organic acid by weight of flour in the dough
the remaining claims included an additional phosphate salt limitation
after some initial correspondence between kim and the pto the examiner rejected claims 1-3 5-9 13-17 and 19 as obvious in light of the tanaka_reference u.s. patent no._4296,133 filed aug._24,_1979 and two other_references
with respect to claim 1 the examiner noted that the prior_art_references disclosed` bread_doughs containing the combination of ascorbic_acid with organic acids' and that` [ a ] s far as the claim is understood the reference shows the same combination claimed'
j.a.at 2735
the examiner also noted that` [ t ] he limitation of the phosphate salt recited in some of the claims is not considered patentably significant
[ other references ] disclose the use of the claimed phosphate salts in bread_doughs'
id

on september 19 1994 kim abandoned her original_application and filed a continuation-in-part_application
the sole independent_claim claim 1 included an ascorbic_acid limitation 15-250 ppm a food_acid limitation 0.02-0.15 parts per 100 parts of flour and a phosphate_limitation 0.15-0.40 parts per 100 parts of flour
in filing her continuation-in-part_application kim noted that the invention uses a` composition comprising ascorbic_acid food_acid and phosphate as oxiding agent replacers'
j.a.at 2776
the examiner initially rejected all the claims as obvious in light of the tanaka and other_references
after a telephone conference with kim the examiner amended the application by changing the method_claims into composition_claims and by changing the transition_phrase from` comprising' to` consisting essentially of'
the examiner allowed the claims as amended noting that` [ n ] one of the prior_art of record teaches or suggests either an ascorbic_composition consisting essentially of the specific_components ascorbic_acid a food_acid and a phosphate in a specific_amount or that such ascorbic_acid_composition would be effective as a slow-acting oxidizing_agent so that it would effectively replace a slow-acting oxidizing_agent such as potassium_bromate'
j.a.at 2827
u.s._patent_no._5510,129 for a` potassium_bromate_replacer_composition' issued to kim on april_23,_1996

less than three weeks later on may_14,_1996 kim surrendered her patent and filed a` reissue_application' alleging that an error arose during the prosecution of the original_patent
in applying for a reissued_patent kim essentially sought to amend her original_patent in two ways 1 by adding claims 5-10 covering a composition comprising of ascorbic_acid and food_acid but not requiring phosphate ; and 2 by changing the original_claims ascorbic_acid range from 15-250 ppm to 10-300 ppm and changing the food_acid_range from 0.02-0.15 parts per 100 parts of flour to 0.015-0.2 parts per 100 parts of flour
in other words kim tried to broaden the original_claims by adding new claims that did not include the phosphate_limitation and by broadening all the claims ascorbic and food_acid_ranges

the examiner initially rejected the reissue_application as violating the rule against recapturing material that was surrendered or withdrawn during prosecution of the original_patent
in so doing the examiner did not state which of kims changes would violate the rule against recapture
after additional amendments not relevant to this case the examiner allowed the reissued_patent on october 26 1999 as the ¡¬355_patent

the reissue procedure allows a patentee to broaden the scope of an existing patent to include subject_matter that had been erroneously excluded from that patent
35 u.s.c.¡± 251 2000
this procedure *1322 however is not without its limitations
for example the` recapture_rule prevents a patentee from regaining through reissue the subject_matter that he surrendered in an effort to obtain allowance of the original_claims'
pannu v. storz instruments inc. 258_f.3d_1366 1370-71 fed.cir.2001 internal_quotation_marks omitted
we have articulated a three-step process for applying the recapture_rule the first step is to determine whether and in what aspect the reissue claims are broader than the patent_claims
the second step is to determine whether the broader_aspects of the reissued claim related to surrendered subject_matter
finally the court must determine whether the reissued claims were materially narrowed in other respects to avoid the recapture_rule
id.at 1371 internal_quotation_marks omitted

here the first and third steps are not at issue ; that is kim concedes that reissued claims 5_and_10 are in fact broader than the original_patented claims because they cover a non-phosphate potassium_bromate_replacer_composition and a broader food_acid_range
further kim concedes that neither reissued claim is narrower in any other material aspect
thus the only issue is whether the broader_aspects of the reissued claims relate to` surrendered' subject_matter
in this respect we reject kims position that she should be treated differently from other patentees because she was pro se during some parts of the prosecution and her argument that she was not responsible for the original amendment made with her acquiescence by the examiner

the challenger of the reissued_patent here conagra must establish surrender of recaptured subject_matter by clear and convincing_evidence
see superior fireplace co. v. majestic prods co. 270_f.3d_1358 1367 fed.cir.2001
a patentee can surrender subject_matter either through arguments or amendments made during the prosecution of the original_patent
hester indus. inc. v. stein inc. 142_f.3d_1472 1480-81 fed.cir.1998
whether surrender of recaptured subject_matter has occurred is a question of law which we review de novo
see n. american container inc. v. plastipak packaging inc. 415_f.3d_1335 1349 fed.cir.2005

the district_court here suggested that the patentees subjective_intent should be evaluated in determining whether the patentee surrendered subject_matter
some of our recapture decisions explain that` [ e ] rror under the reissue_statute does not include a deliberate decision to surrender specific subject_matter in order to overcome prior_art' mentor_corp. v. coloplast inc. 998_f.2d_992 996 fed.cir.1993 emphasis added and that the prerequisite error for a reissue can exist if` there is no evidence that the [ applicant ] intentionally omitted or abandoned the claimed subject_matter'
ball corp. 729 f.2d at 1435-36 emphasis added
but these cases do not suggest that the patentees subjective_intent is pertinent to the question of surrender
these decisions simply distinguish between a patentees inadvertent` error' for which the reissue_statute provides a remedy and a patentees` surrender' for which the recapture_rule prevents a reissue10

*1323 it is clear that in determining whether` surrender' of subject_matter has occurred the proper inquiry is whether an objective observer viewing the prosecution_history would conclude that the purpose of the patentees amendment or argument was to overcome prior_art and secure the patent
this is because the recapture_rule is aimed at ensuring that the public can rely on a patentees admission during prosecution of an original_patent
`` it is precisely because the patentee amended his claims to overcome prior_art that a member of the public is entitled to occupy the space abandoned by the patent applicant.. [ t ] he reissue_statute can not be construed in such a way that competitors properly relying on prosecution_history become patent infringers when they do so'
mentor_corp. 998 f.2d at 996 ; see also vectra fitness inc. v. tnwk corp. 162_f.3d_1379 1384 fed.cir.1998` [ t ] herecapture_rule prevents a patentee from regaining through reissue subject_matter surrendered during prosecution thus ensuring the ability of the public to rely on a patents public record'
( emphasis added11 thus if the objective public observer can discern a surrender of subject_matter during the prosecution of an original_patent in order to overcome prior_art and obtain the patent then the recapture_rule should prevent the reissuing of that patent to claim the surrendered subject_matter

with this in mind we turn to conagras allegations of surrender
conagra contends that during the prosecution of the original_patent kim surrendered 1 a non-phosphate potassium_bromate_replacer_composition and 2 a potassium_bromate_replacer_composition with a food_acid_range broader than 0.02-0.15 parts per 100 parts_flour

first with respect to the non-phosphate potassium_bromate_replacer_composition conagra contends that kim added phosphate to all of the claims in her continuation-in-part_application in order to overcome the initial rejection of her original_application as obvious over tanaka and other prior_art_references
conagra argues that the addition of phosphate was a surrender of non-phosphate potassium_bromate_replacer claims which kim later recaptured in the reissued_patent
to support its view that the addition of phosphate constitutes a` surrender' conagra points to the examiners` reasons for allowance' of kims continuation-in-part_application which stated that the prior_art does not` teach [ ] or suggest [ ].. an ascorbic_composition consisting essentially of the specific_components ascorbic_acid a food_acid and a phosphate in a specific_amount'
j.a.at 2827
like the district_court we are not persuaded by conagras arguments
kim overcame the obviousness_rejection by changing the transition_phrase from` comprising' to` consisting essentially of' and by changing her method_claims to composition_claims
while the phosphate_limitation was added at the same time the prosecution_history does not indicate that kim added that limitation in particular in order to overcome the obviousness_rejection
significantly the examiner had previously rejected claims of the original_application that included phosphate and noted that the phosphate salt limitation there was not` patentably significant'
j.a.at 2735
thus the prosecution *1324 history refutes the argument that phosphate was added by kim to overcome a rejection

second with respect to the food_acid_range conagra argues that kim surrendered a lower_limit for her food_acid_range when she changed the range from 0.03-0.2 parts by weight of flour in the dough in her original_application to 0.02-0.15 parts per 100 parts of flour in her continuation-in-part_application
conagra contends that kim later recaptured the surrendered lower_limit when she broadened the food_acid_range to 0.015-0.2 parts per 100 parts of flour in her reissued_patent
conagra suggests that kim narrowed her food_acid_range in order to distinguish her claim from the tanaka_reference
however this assertion is belied by the prosecution_history
as the district_court explained` the range for the food_acids used in the pertinent prior_art tanaka had been [ 0 ]0005 to [ 0 ]006
plaintiffs lower end choice of [ 0 ]015 [ in the reissue_application ] or 0.02 [ in the original_application ] are both a significant difference from [ 0 ]006
it can not be inferred that plaintiffs choice of [ 0 ]020 instead of [ 0 ]015 was because plaintiff was surrendering the difference between the two out of fear [ 0 ]015 would be found to be obvious while [ 0 ]020 would not'
j.a.at 5196
further` [ t ] he patent_examiner did not indicate that [ the original_applications ] range [ of 0.03-0.2 ] was obvious in light of the prior_art
instead the patent_examiner indicated that the use of food_acid and ascorbic_acid in general was disclosed by the prior_art and that the particular range.. was indefinite in that it was unclear if it was measured solely in ratio to flour'
j.a.at 5194-95
we agree with the district_court
we therefore affirm the district_courts denial of conagras motion for jmol of invalidity based on the recapture_rule

b anticipation and obviousness
the next question is whether the district_court correctly determined that the jury_verdict of no invalidity was supported by substantial_evidence
in this connection the burden was on conagra to establish invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
honeywell int l v. hamilton sundstrand corp. 370_f.3d_1131 1145 fed.cir.2004

the same claim_construction governs for validity determinations as for infringement determinations
see door-master corp. v. yorktowne inc. 256_f.3d_1308 1312 fed.cir.2001
having affirmed the district_courts claim_construction which requires kims potassium_bromate_replacer to have essentially the same_functions as potassium_bromate any anticipatory prior_art_reference must necessarily exhibit those same_functions
conagra makes virtually no effort to show that the asserted prior_art_references disclose such functions
however even if we assumed that these prior_art_references disclosed compositions with the claimed functionality there was substantial_evidence that the references did not contain the claimed proportions of ascorbic and food_acids

first conagra argues that claim 5 was invalid as anticipated by and obvious over the jorgensen_patent u.s. patent no._2149,682 issued march_7,_1939 because jorgensen disclosed replacing potassium_bromate with lemon_juice which naturally contains both ascorbic_acid and food_acid in the form of citric_acid in the ranges disclosed in claim 5

conagras expert at trial dr. hoseney testified that concentrations of ascorbic and citric_acid included in a bread_mix made with jorgensens formula would fall within kims claimed ascorbic and food_acid_ranges
on cross-examination hoseney was questioned about how he determined the ascorbic and citric_acid concentrations *1325 in lemon_juice and he explained that he used averages from a food chemistry book
he also acknowledged that the acid level in individual lemons vary and that he did not himself` press any lemons in the manner mentioned in the jorgensen_patent' or` do any tests on lemon_juice' in order to come to his conclusion
j.a.at 767 775

`` what a prior_art_reference discloses in an anticipation analysis is a factual determination'
novo nordisk pharm. inc. v. bio-tech
gen. corp. 424_f.3d_1347 1355 fed.cir.2005 internal_citations omitted
here the jury was free to disregard hoseneys testimony because hoseney did not conduct any tests to determine the acid concentrations in the product produced by the jorgensen formula
see e.g. liquid dynamics corp. v. vaughan corp. 449_f.3d_1209 1218 fed.cir.2006` it is not our duty.. to reevaluate the weight or credibility of the evidence`
having found that claim 5 is not shown obvious by the jorgensen reference the jury likewise could have found that claim 10 which adds the additional_limitation of yeast was not obvious over jorgensen

conagra further argued that claims 5_and_10 are obvious over the destefanis patent application u.k.app
no._2264,429 because that reference includes ascorbic and food_acids within the ranges of those claimed by kim.12

destefanis disclosed three formulations of bread improver compositions including varying amounts of ascorbic_acid food_acid and several other ingredients
kim concedes that destefanis disclosed ascorbic_acid ranges within her claimed ascorbic_acid ranges
however conagra and kim dispute whether destefanis disclosed food_acid_ranges within kims claimed ranges
while the destefanis_reference contains numeric_values assigned to food_acid it is not entirely clear what scale of measurement destefanis assigned to these numeric_values
on the one hand the ascorbic_acid and food_acid_values are listed in columns under the heading` formulation ppm' suggesting that the food_acid_values are being given in ppm
on the other hand the reference also includes another list of ascorbic_acid in ppm which does not correspond to the first set of ascorbic_acid values suggesting that the food_acid_values listed under the` ppm' column might actually be percentages
conagra adopts *1326 this latter view suggesting that the` ppm' header in the destefanis patent is a typographical error and that when the food_acid_values are read as percentages they are within kims claimed ranges
during trial kims testified about the destefanis_reference and suggested that it was improper to read the reference as conagra does
the determination of what a prior_art_reference discloses is a question of fact
the jury was entitled to believe kim and find that this reference does not disclose food_acid_ranges within kims ranges
see novo nordisk pharm. inc. 424 f.3d at 1355

we thus conclude that the jury_verdict that the claims were not invalid was supported by substantial_evidence

for the foregoing reasons the decision below is affirmed

schall circuit_judge concurring-in-part dissenting-in-part
i fully agree with the majority opinions well-reasoned analysis of the recapture and invalidity issues
however i am unable to agree with the majoritys construction of the term` potassium_bromate_replacer' in claims 5-big_token__8_and_10__big_token of the ¡¬355_patent
for that reason i would remand the case to the district_court for an infringement_analysis under what i believe to be the correct claim_construction
accordingly i respectfully dissent-in-part

`` [ o ] ur cases recognize that the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess
in such cases the inventors lexicography governs'
phillips v. awh_corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1316 fed.cir.2005 en banc citing ccs fitness inc. v. brunswick corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1366 fed.cir.2002
upon review of the specification and prosecution_history i conclude that kim acted as her own_lexicographer in defining the term` potassium_bromate_replacer' as` a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process'
thus i would construe the term in that manner

ii
throughout the specification of the ¡¬355_patent kim consistently defines the term` potassium_bromate_replacer' as` a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process'
the first instance occurs in the abstract which states in relevant part` the potassium_bromate_replacer essentially comprises ascorbic_acid food_acid and/or phosphate
it is a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process
it is also an effective_oxidant that produces properly oxidized dough needed in the production of high_quality yeast-leavened products'
¡¬355_patent abstract emphasis added
the next instance occurs in the background_section which provides` it is a further object of the present_invention to provide the ascorbic_acid_composition that acts as a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process'
¡¬355_patent col._2,_ll._45-49 emphasis added
in describing how the claimed invention overcomes disadvantages of prior potassium_bromate_replacers the background_section further provides the advantages of the potassium_bromate_replacer provided in the present_invention are *1327 a it comprises all natural ingredients
( b it is a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process
( c it is an effective_oxidant that produces properly oxidized dough needed in the production of high_quality yeast-leavened products
( d it is specifically adapted for various methods of the breadmaking_process
furthermore the potassium_bromate_replacer provided in the present_invention is a more effective_oxidant than potassium_bromate because potassium_bromate has little_effect on oxidation of dough during mixing and the early_stages of proofing
¡¬355_patent col._2,_l._57 to col._3,_l._5 emphasis added

the summary of the invention is also insightful
it states in part the present_invention relates to potassium_bromate_replacer comprising an ascorbic_acid_composition that replaces an oxidizing_agent of potassium_bromate
the potassium_bromate_replacer essentially comprises ascorbic_acid food_acid and/or phosphate
in methods for preparing the ascorbic_acid_composition it has been discovered that a food_acid added in an effective_amount slows down oxidation of ascorbic_acid to dehydroascorbic_acid in a dough and thus ascorbic_acid is changed to a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process
¡¬355_patent col._3,_ll._8-18 emphasis added
these passages evince that kim defined` potassium_bromate_replacer' to mean` a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process'

the detailed_description is consistent with the passages cited above
it states [ a ] food_acid slows down oxidation of ascorbic_acid to dehydroascorbic_acid in dough by forming metal_ion-food_acid complex during the mixing stage of dough and gradually dissociating into free metal_ion and food_acid during the later stages of the manufacturing_process
thereby ascorbic_acid is changed from a fast_acting_oxidant to a slow_acting_oxidant
thus ascorbic_acid combined with a food_acid acts as a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process
¡¬355_patent col._5,_ll._26-34 emphasis added
the detailed_description continues as illustrated in the preparation of ascorbic_acid_composition a food_acid added in an effective_amount allows ascorbic_acid to oxidize at a slow rate in a dough
thus ascorbic_acid acts as a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process
now ascorbic_acid and food_acid replace an oxidizing_agent of potassium_bromate
'355_patent col._6,_ll._3-9 emphasis added1 thus from the beginning of the *1328 patent in the abstract through the detailed_description kim consistently defined` potassium_bromate_replacer' as` a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process'

in my view the prosecution_history also is instructive
in a response to an office_action in which she amended her claims kim stated 3_to_30 ppm_ascorbic_acid combined with 5_to_60 ppm dicarboxylic_acids does not act as a slow_acting_oxidant due to insufficient amounts of ascorbic_acid and dicarboxylic_acids used ; thus it is not potassium_bromate_replacer
about 10-300 ppm_ascorbic_acid combined with about 150-2,000 ppm food_acid acts as a slow_acting_oxidant ; thus it is potassium_bromate_replacer.. kim continued` [ t ] he potassium_bromate_replacer_composition developed is a new slow_acting_oxidant that is effective during mixing proofing and baking
`` 2 these statements are consistent with statements made almost four years earlier in response to an office_action in a related application
there kim wrote` it has been discovered that a food_acid added in an effective_amount slows down oxidation of ascorbic_acid to dehydroascorbic [ sic ] acid in dough
thus ascorbic_acid is changed to a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process
now ascorbic_acid and food_acid replace potassium_bromate'
it seems to me that these passages from the prosecution_history when combined with the statements in the specification compel the conclusion that kim was acting as her own_lexicographer by defining a` potassium_bromate_replacer' as` a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process'

the majority construes the term` potassium_bromate_replacer' as` a composition that performs essentially the same_function in the production of bread as would potassium_bromate by strengthening the dough increasing loaf_volume and contributing to fine_crumb_grain..' majority op.at 1318
for me the problem with the majoritys claim_construction is that it focuses almost exclusively on the background_section of the ¡¬355_patent and fails to take into account the remainder of the specification and the prosecution_history
the majority quotes the background as stating that` the potassium_bromate_replacer provided in the present_invention is a more effective_oxidant than potassium_bromate..' majority op.at 1318 quoting ¡¬355_patent col._3,_ll._1-2
the majority then relies on the statement that
[ o ] xidizing agents provide strengthening of dough during the manufacturing_process of yeast-leavened products
as a result oxidizing_agents are used to provide greater_loaf_volume improve internal_characteristics such as grain and texture and enhance symmetry and keeping quality of yeast-leavened products
¡¬355_patent col._1,_ll._20-27
this passage appears at the beginning of the background_section
it discusses oxidizing_agents generally-not the present_invention specifically

*1329 in sum in my view the intrinsic records repeated defining of a` potassium_bromate_replacer' as` a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process' overwhelms the portion of the specification upon which the majority relies for its claim_construction
thus i would conclude that kim acted as her own_lexicographer in defining a` potassium_bromate_replacer' as` a slow_acting_oxidant that is functional throughout the entire_manufacturing_process'
see merck & co. v. teva pharms
usa inc. 395_f.3d_1364 1370 fed.cir.2005` when a patentee acts as his own_lexicographer in redefining the meaning of particular claim terms away from their ordinary meaning he must clearly express that intent in the written description`
accordingly i would vacate the judgment of the district_court and remand the case for an infringement_analysis under this claim_construction

for simplicity we refer to claims 5_and_10 as the asserted claims
however kim also asserted claims dependent from claim 5
since we conclude that claim 5 is not infringed it necessarily follows in this case that the dependent_claims are also not infringed
2
claim 5 recites a potassium_bromate_replacer_composition consisting essentially of by weight a about 0.big_token__001_to_0__big_token03 parts ascorbic_acid as an oxidant per 100 parts_flour b about 0.big_token__015_to_0__big_token2 parts_food_acid per 100 parts_flour said food_acid selected from the group consisting of acetic_acid citric_acid fumaric_acid lactic_acid malic_acid oxalic_acid phosphoric_acid succinic_acid tartaric_acid fruit_juice fruit_juice_concentrate vinegar wine and mixtures thereof and

prior to this the district_court had entered judgment in favor of conagra because the ¡¬355_patent had been found invalid by the district_court in kim v. the earthgrains_co. no._01- cv-3895 2002_wl_1949235_(n.d.ill._aug._22,_2002)
however after we reversed that invalidity determination in kim v. the earthgrains_co. 60_fed.appx._270_(fed.cir.2003) the district_court here reinstated kims action against conagra
4
we may consider legal_error in the jury instruction on claim 5 even though kim did not file a post-verdict jmol_motion on the issue
see e.g. flex-rest llc v. steelcase inc. 455_f.3d_1351 1356-1357 fed.cir.2006` notwithstanding the absence of a motion for jmol a party may still challenge a jury_verdict by establishing that the judge committed legal_error in instructing the jury'
( internal_citations and quotation marks omitted

kim also argues that because dependent_claims 7_and_8 add specific functionality limitations independent_claim 5 must not require functional attributes
claim 7 requires that the ascorbic_acid act as a` slow_acting_oxidant' and claim 8 requires that the ascorbic_acid in the composition be a` more effective_oxidant' than when used alone during the manufacturing_process
however under the district_courts claim_construction claim 5 requires the potassium_bromate_replacer to have essentially the same_function in the production of bread as would potassium_bromate
as noted in the text below this construction does not require the potassium_bromate_replacer to be a slow_acting_oxidant nor does it require that the ascorbic_acid be more effective in this composition than when used alone
the fact that the dependent_claims may require additional functional attributes does not undermine the district_courts claim_construction
6
we see no abuse of discretion in the district_courts refusal to exclude kims testimony on daubert grounds
gen. elec co. v. joiner 522_u.s._136 143 118_s.ct._512 139_l.ed.2d_508_(1997) holding that the` abuse of discretion' standard of review applies to the district_courts evidentiary rulings
7
in light of our disposition we need not decide whether kims objection was properly preserved
see unitherm food sys. inc. v. swift-eckrich inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 126_s.ct._980 163_l.ed.2d_974_(2006)

kim also asks for attorneys fees and costs both at trial and on appeal
we see no basis for an award of fees
9
although we affirm the noninfringement findings of the jury and the district_court we reach conagras invalidity arguments because conagra filed a separate declaratory_judgment counterclaim seeking a declaration of invalidity
conagras counterclaim included anticipation invalidity and recapture arguments
`` a party seeking a declaratory_judgment of invalidity presents a claim independent of the patentees charge of infringement'
cardinal chem co. v. morton int l inc. 508_u.s._83 96 113_s.ct._1967 124_l.ed.2d_1_(1993)

`` if a patentee tries to recapture what he or she previously surrendered in order to obtain allowance of original_patent_claims that deliberate withdrawal or amendment.. can not be said to involve the inadvertence or mistake contemplated by 35 u.s.c.¡± 251 and is not an error of the kind which will justify the granting of a reissue patent which includes the matter withdrawn'
mentor_corp. 998 f.2d at 995 internal_quotation_marks omitted
11
`` deliberately canceling or amending a claim in an effort to overcome a reference strongly suggests that the applicant admits that the scope of the claim before the cancellation or amendment is unpatentable but it is not dispositive because other evidence in the prosecution_history may indicate the contrary'
in re clement 131_f.3d_1464 1469 fed.cir.1997
12
this is in fact an anticipation_argument rather than an obviousness argument
however as the district_court noted` at trial [ conagra ] raised destefanis as a basis for obviousness not anticipation'
j.a.at 14_n._6
in arguing that conagra presented destefanis as an anticipatory reference to the jury conagras brief selectively and inappropriately quotes one paragraph of the jury_instructions which sets forth the legal standard for anticipation and then quotes a separate paragraph which identified prior_art for both anticipation and obviousness and which identifies the destefanis_reference
cross-appellants reply br.at 22
based on this conagra urges that the issue was preserved
the jury_instructions specific to the` anticipation affirmative defense' explicitly list the defendants anticipation allegations and these allegations were limited to the jorgensen_patent and a sara lee product
j.a.at 163
it is impermissible to sustain a jury_verdict on instructions as to obviousness and not anticipation simply because different instructions that requested the jury to address anticipation might have led to a supportable verdict
this is different from considering anticipation and obviousness in the context of a jmol_motion where we have held that a jmol_motion as to obviousness is sufficient to preserve an anticipation challenge
see mercexchange l.l.c
v. ebay inc. 401_f.3d_1323 1334 fed.cir.2005
under the circumstances in this case the anticipation_argument was not preserved
even if the anticipation_argument had been preserved it is without merit as discussed in the text

lastly the detailed_description concludes summarizing it has been discovered that a food_acid added in an effective_amount slows down oxidation of ascorbic_acid to dehydroascorbic_acid in a dough thereby ascorbic_acid is changed to a slow_acting_oxidant and a phosphate increases the amount of complex formation with food_acid and metal_ion
thus the ascorbic_acid_composition essentially comprises ascorbic_acid food_acid and phosphate and replaces an oxidizing_agent of potassium_bromate or other oxidizing_agents
the potassium_bromate_replacer provided in the present_invention is a more effective_oxidant than [ sic ] potassium_bromate because potassium_bromate has little_effect on oxidation of dough during mixing and the early_stages of proofing
¡¬355_patent col._7,_l._62 to col._8,_l._7
2
furthermore in an earlier response kim wrote the applicants invention uses food_acids to slow down oxidation of ascorbic_acid to dehydroasorbic acid resulting in the improvement in the role of ascorbic_acid as an oxidant in the breadmaking_process.. phosphate is used to enhance the complexing power of food by increasing the ph value of the dough..
accordingly the ascorbic_acid is changed from a fast_acting_oxidant to a slow_acting_oxidant that is effective and functional during mixing proofing and baking
