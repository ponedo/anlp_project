background
in january 2013 va sued defendants alleging infringement of u.s. patent no._8095,413413_patent
on may_24,_2013 salesforce filed a petition with the patent_trial and appeal_board ptab for post-grant review of all claims of the ¡¬413_patent under the cbm_program
in the petition salesforce argued that all claims of the ¡¬413_patent were eligible for this form of post-grant review because they are directed *1309 to a` covered business_method_patent' within the meaning of ¡± 18 a 1 of the america_invents_act aia pub l. no._112-29 125_stat._284 329-31 2011 and that salesforce had standing to bring the petition because it was sued for patent infringement aia_¡± 18 a 1 b
salesforce further argued the ptab should institute cbm_review because all the claims of the ¡¬413_patent were more likely than not patent-ineligible under 35 u.s.c.¡± 101 and invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 103 in view of several prior_art_references

on may_29,_2013 defendants filed a motion to stay district_court_proceedings pursuant to aia_¡± 18 b 1
see defendants joint_motion to stay proceedings virtual-agility inc. v. salesforce.com inc. 13-cv-00111 e.d.tex
may_29,_2013 ecf no._67
in august 2013 while this motion was pending the district_court issued a discovery order and held a scheduling conference setting an april 2014 date for a claim_construction_hearing and a november 2014 date for jury_selection
also in august 2013 va filed a preliminary response in opposition to salesforces petition at the ptab pursuant to 37 c.f.r.¡± 42.207 a
in november 2013 the ptab granted-in-part salesforces petition based on its conclusion that all claims of the ¡¬413_patent are directed to a covered business_method and are more likely than not patent-ineligible under 35 u.s.c.¡± 101 and invalid under ¡± 102 as anticipated by u.s. patent no._5761,674 ito
the ptab also issued its own scheduling order setting a july 2014 date for a trial on the validity of the ¡¬413_patent_claims

in early january 2014 the district_court denied defendants motion to stay the case pending cbm_review
virtualagility_inc. v. salesforce.com inc. 13-cv-00111 2014_wl_94371 e.d.tex
jan._9,_2014
defendants timely filed an interlocutory appeal to this court and also filed motions to stay district_court_proceedings pending the disposition of this appeal with the district_court and this court
while these motions were pending va filed a motion to amend the ¡¬413_patent_claims with the ptab contingent on the claims invalidation

cbm2013-00024 paper 26 jan._28,_2014
in february we issued an order staying proceedings in the district_court pending our disposition of defendants motion to stay pending appeal
virtualagility_inc. v. salesforce.com inc. 14-1232 fed.cir
feb._12,_2014 ecf no._34
pursuant to our order the district_court entered the stay pending appeal

discussion
we have jurisdiction over this appeal under aia_¡± 18 b 2 which provides that` [ a ] party may take an immediate interlocutory appeal from a district_courts decision' granting or denying a motion to stay litigation pending cbm_review
the statute instructs the district_court to consider the following four factors when deciding whether to grant a stay a whether a stay or the denial thereof will simplify the issues in question and streamline the trial ; b whether discovery is complete and whether a trial_date has been set ; c whether a stay or the denial thereof would unduly prejudice the nonmoving party or present a clear_tactical_advantage for the moving party ; and
( d whether a stay or the denial thereof will reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and on the court
aia_¡± 18 b 1
the statute further provides that we` shall review the district_courts decision to ensure consistent_application of established precedent and such review may be de novo'
id.¡± 18 b 2 emphasis added

i
standard of review
the parties dispute the standard of review that we should apply to this case
*1310 defendants contend that the statute` encourages full de novo_review where factual evidence and conclusions of law are reviewed fully and independently'
appellants br
15
va responds that we should review the order denying a stay with deference because such decisions implicate district_courts management of their own dockets which is a matter traditionally left to their discretion
we note that prior to the aia district_court decisions on motions to stay pending u.s. patent and trademark office pto proceedings were generally not appealable and when they were we reviewed them under the abuse of discretion_standard
procter & gamble_co. v. kraft foods global inc. 549_f.3d_842 845 848-49 fed.cir.2008 ; see also landis v. n. am co. 299_u.s._248 254-55 57_s.ct._163 81_l.ed._153_(1936) ; gould v. control_laser_corp. 705_f.2d_1340 1341 fed.cir.1983
we also note that the aia expressly created an immediate right of appeal of stay decisions pending cbm_review gave us jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeals and that the only standard mentioned in the statute is de novo_review
nevertheless we need not resolve this dispute because we hold that even under the abuse of discretion_standard argued for by va the district_courts decision to deny a stay pending the ptabs review of the ¡¬413_patent_claims under the cbm_program must be reversed
nothing in this opinion should be read as deciding the standard of review applicable to the ultimate stay decision or the individual_factors
we leave it to a future case to resolve what congress meant when it indicated that our` review may be de novo'

ii
factors a and d simplification of issues and reduced burden of litigation
the district_court concluded that the first_factor-simplification of the issues-was` essentially neutral if not slightly against' granting a stay because it was` not convinced' by the ptabs assessment that cancellation of some or all of the claims during cbm_review was` probable'
virtualagility 2014_wl_94371 at *2 *5
the district_court reviewed the lengthy prosecution history that the ¡¬413_patent underwent before issuance
the court was persuaded that` there can be little dispute here about the thoroughness of the ptos prior_examination of the ¡¬413_patent given the various grounds of invalidity and the breadth of prior_art_references considered by the pto before issuing this patent'
id.at 3
the court then performed its own evaluation of the bases upon which the ptab granted the cbm_petition
the court stated that even though the ito_patent had never been before the pto it was not persuaded that ito anticipates all of the claims given the ptos extensive review of other prior_art during` a lengthy prosecution process'
id
the court also concluded that the value of the ptabs consideration of ito was` marginal' because defendants introduced two other pieces of prior_art in the district_court_proceedings-which they represented were` of particular_importance' -that salesforce did not include in its cbm_petition
id
with regard to the ptabs decision to review whether the ¡¬413_patent_claims are patent-ineligible the court observed that the claims were amended during prosecution to overcome an earlier ¡± 101 rejection
based on its assessment of the claims and the law of ¡± 101 the court` was not persuaded that the ptab will likely cancel all claims of the ¡¬ 413 patent' as patent-ineligible
id.at 4
in spite of the ptabs grant of the cbm_petition finding that all the claims of the ¡¬413_patent were more likely than not invalid on two different grounds the district_court concluded that it was not convinced that the ptab would cancel some or all of the ¡¬413_patent_claims
the court further concluded that it was not convinced that the cbm_review would simplify *1311 the issues in this case and that therefore this factor was` neutral if not slightly against granting a stay'
id.at 5

the court determined that the parties arguments regarding the fourth_factor-burden of litigation-' substantially overlap' with those presented under the first_factor
it found that` the specific circumstances in the instant case present only a limited possibility' of a reduced_burden on the court and the parties
id.at 8
the court therefore concluded that the fourth_factor` weighs only slightly in favor of a stay'
id

after the court denied the motion for a stay va filed proposed claim_amendments in the cbm_review
defendants filed a motion to at least stay district_court_proceedings pending appeal of the denial of the motion to stay
defendants argued that the fact that va has already filed a motion to amend claims in the cbm_proceeding increased the likelihood that the cbm_proceeding will simplify issues
in its decision denying the motion to stay pending appeal the court observed that vas proposed amendments to the ¡¬413_patent_claims in the cbm_proceeding were not a part of the record at the time of its decision on the motion now on appeal
see virtualagility_inc. v. salesforce.com inc. 13-cv-00111 2014_wl_807588_(e.d.tex._feb._27,_2014)
on the merits the court concluded that defendants` made no attempt at showing how.. conditions triggering the amendments would likely arise' and have not` challenged [ its ] previous finding that cancellation of some or all the claims was unlikely'
id.at 2
the court also noted that` [ t ] o the extent any further statements [ by va ] or amendments to claims may affect [ its ] claim_construction such is fully remediable with supplemental_claim_constructions'
id.at 3
thus the court concluded that the fact that va moved to amend the claims in the cbm_proceeding did not affect its determination regarding the first and fourth_factors

on appeal defendants contend that the district_court made` critical errors' in finding the first_factor neutral or slightly against the stay
defendants argue that cbm_review will simplify and streamline issues for trial because the district_court would not need to address any claims that are cancelled and because defendants will be estopped from challenging the validity of the ¡¬ 413 patent in view of ¡± 101 and the ito_patent after the review is concluded.2 defendants further argue that claim_amendments during cbm_review may eliminate infringement_arguments and give rise to intervening rights
they contend that the district_court should not have second-guessed the ptabs conclusion that all ¡¬413_patent_claims are` more likely than not' anticipated by ito and invalid under ¡± 101

defendants also argue that the fourth_factor likewise strongly favors a stay because cbm_review may spare salesforces customers who have also been sued by va from discovery while` the true_parties in interest' focus on the validity of the ¡¬413_patent at the ptab
they argue that a stay will further reduce discovery burdens on third_parties
finally they contend that the district_court erred by conflating the fourth_factor with the first_factor and by giving it too little weight

va counters that a stay will not significantly simplify this case or reduce the *1312 burden on the court and the parties
as an initial matter va contends that we should not take into account its motion to amend because it was not a part of the record below
va asserts that while the motion to stay litigation pending cbm_review was pending it told defendants that it might move to amend the claims
it contends that because defendants did not notify the district_court about vas possible amendments they waived any argument about the motion to amend
on the merits va points out that the motion seeks to amend only seven of the twenty-one asserted_claims and that the amendments may not necessarily be entered for any of the claims
it contends that the proposed amendments merely clarify the claim_language and are not related to claim_construction disputes currently before the district_court and thus would not significantly impact the litigation

va also argues that a stay is unlikely to meaningfully simplify the case because invalidity_issues not before the ptab as well as infringement and damages issues will remain as long as a single claim survives cbm_review
it contends the ptabs ¡± 101 review is also unlikely to simplify the case because patent-eligibility analysis is generally not resource-intensive
va contends that the district_courts conclusion that the claims would likely survive the ptabs scrutiny was reasonable based on its assessment of ¡± 101 law
further va argues that there is a` palpable risk' that we would vacate the ptabs decision to initiate cbm_review of the ¡¬413_patent under the administrative procedure act apa because it is not a` covered business_method_patent' within the meaning of ¡± 18 d 1 of the aia
it argues that defendants assertion that ptab_review would simplify litigation is contrary to trial_court experience and that the district_court therefore properly rejected defendants` generic' arguments that a stay pending cbm_review would promote efficient adjudication in this case
va contends that salesforces arguments about its customer defendants and third_parties were not properly preserved for appeal
it argues that in any event the customers are the true_parties in interest because they partner with salesforce and that a stay would not reduce a burden on third_parties because most third-party discovery has already taken place

we conclude that it is proper for us to consider the fact that va filed a motion to amend in our review of the district_courts decision
defendants did not waive the arguments regarding claim_amendments
they argued to the district_court that claim_amendments during ptab_review are a distinct possibility and in doing so gave va an opportunity to respond to this argument below
defendants joint_motion to stay proceedings at 7-8

we also conclude that we are not improperly expanding the record on appeal if we consider the motion to amend

we are mindful that` [ a ] n appellate_court may consider only the record as it was made before the district_court'

nevertheless pursuant to rule 201 b 2 of the federal_rules of evidence we may take judicial notice of the fact that a filing was made before the ptab
see e.g. genentech inc. v. chiron corp. 112_f.3d_495 497_n._1_(fed.cir.1997) noting that because the` record before the board is a public record.. and thus capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to unquestionable sources' judicial *1313 notice was appropriate
cognizant of the limits imposed by rule 201 b 2 however we reiterate that we consider only the fact that a motion to amend was filed-not the impact of the proposed amendments on the parties claim_construction and infringement_arguments
the latter can not be` accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned'
fed.r.evid
201 b 2
moreover the district_courts ability to address the motion to amend in its ruling denying a stay of its proceedings pending appeal supports our consideration of the fact that va filed proposed claim_amendments because we are not faced with the uncomfortable task of doing so for the first time on appeal
cf
singleton v. wulff 428_u.s._106 121 96_s.ct._2868 49_l.ed.2d_826_(1976)

another preliminary issue concerns the relationship between the first and fourth_factors
we agree with the district_court that there is a great deal of overlap between the parties arguments with regard to these two factors
we note however that the simplification of the issues factor and the burden of litigation_factor are listed separately in the statute
thus even when both factors point in the same direction-in favor of or against the stay-they continue to be separate individual_factors which must be weighed in the stay_determination
we can not as va requests collapse the four-factor_test expressly adopted by congress into a three-factor_test

we conclude that the district_court clearly erred in finding that the first_factor was neutral or slightly against a stay and that the fourth_factor weighed only slightly in favor of a stay
we hold that these factors strongly favor a stay in this case
the district_court erred as a matter of law to the extent that it decided to` review' the ptabs determination that the claims of the ¡¬413_patent are more likely than not invalid in the posture of a ruling on a motion to stay
under the statutory scheme district_courts have no role in reviewing the ptabs determinations regarding the patentability of claims that are subject to cbm_proceedings

indeed a challenge to the ptabs` more likely than not' determination at this stage amounts to an improper_collateral_attack on the ptabs decision to institute cbm_review and allowing it would create serious practical problems
as a preliminary matter congress made post-grant review more difficult to obtain than reexamination by raising the standard from` a substantial new question of patentability' 35 u.s.c.¡± 303 a 2012 to` more likely than not.. unpatentable' id.¡± 324 a
congress clearly did not intend district_courts to hold mini-trials reviewing the ptabs decision on the merits of the cbm_review
to do so would overwhelm and dramatically expand the nature of the stay_determination
if the district_court were required to` review' the merits of the ptabs decision to institute a cbm_proceeding as part of its stay_determination it would undermine the purpose of the stay
when the stay decision is then appealed to this court we would be required to likewise review the ptabs decision to institute a cbm_proceeding
this is clearly not how or when congress intended review of the ptabs cbm determinations to take place
see id.¡± 141 c` a party to.. a post-grant review who is dissatisfied with the final written decision of the [ ptab ].. may appeal the boards decision only to the united_states_court of appeals for the federal_circuit`
the stay_determination is not the time or the place to review the ptabs decisions to institute a cbm_proceeding.3

*1314 the district_courts decision regarding the first and fourth_factors was based predominantly on its improper review of whether the ptab was correct in its determination that the claims of the ¡¬413_patent were more likely than not invalid
after this review is removed from the calculus the remaining evidence of record weighs heavily in favor of a stay
we find it significant that the ptab granted cbm_review on all asserted_claims of the sole asserted patent
and it determined that all of these claims were more likely than not unpatentable on two separate alternative grounds
the statute allows for institution of post-grant review if` it is more likely than not that at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition is unpatentable'
35 u.s.c.¡± 324 a
in this case the ptab expressly determined that all of the claims are more likely than not unpatentable
this cbm_review could dispose of the entire litigation the ultimate simplification of issues

july_11,_2006 noting that` a stay would further the interests of judicial economy and the conservation of the parties resources as well as that of the court' if a reexamination would` dispose of.. litigation entirely' ; cf
procter & gamble_co. v. team techs. inc. 12-cv-552 2014_wl_533494 at *4 s.d.ohio feb._11,_2014 denying a motion to stay and noting that` in addition to the 11 claims that plaintiff has asserted in this case that are also at issue in the [ inter_partes review proceedings ] the remaining 16 asserted_claims are not at issue in any [ inter_partes review ]' ; cognex corp. v. nat l instruments corp. no._00-442 2001_wl_34368283 at *2 d.del
june_29,_2001 denying a stay pending reexamination in part because the complaint alleged` a variety of claims which are not linked to the patent infringement claim including claims of copyright and trademark infringement and unfair competition all of which require a trial'
this weighs heavily in favor of granting the stay
we reach this conclusion without needing to consider the fact that va moved in the cbm_proceeding to amend claims of the ¡¬413_patent
this fact if considered could only weigh further in favor of granting the stay so as to avoid unnecessary claim_construction of what could potentially be a moving target in terms of claim_language

vas position that salesforces decision to save two pieces of its important prior_art for district_court_proceedings instead of placing it before the ptab has reduced efficiencies is not without support
the simplification argument would be stronger if all of the prior_art or relevant invalidity_issues were in the cbm_review as this would entirely eliminate the trial_courts need to consider validity in the event that some claims survive cbm_review
in this case however where cbm_review has been granted on all claims of the only patent at issue the simplification factor weighs heavily in favor of the stay
if salesforce is successful and the ptab has concluded that it` more likely than not' will be then there would be no need for the district_court to consider the other two prior_art_references
this would not just reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and the court-it would entirely eliminate it.4

*1315 failure to include other known prior_art in the cbm_petition could as we will discuss below create a potential tactical_advantage for defendants that would weigh against a stay under the third factor
cf
gladish v. tyco toys inc. 29 u.s.p.q.2d bna 1718 1720 1993_wl_625509 at *2 e.d.cal.1993 observing that the district_court` is the only forum for a complete consideration of [ the defendants ] evidence of invalidity' and noting that this fact disfavors a stay pending reexamination ; see also enprotech corp. v. autotech corp. 15 u.s.p.q.2d bna 1319 1320 1990_wl_37217 at *1 n.d.ill.1990
we also agree with va that defendants arguments regarding customers and third_parties were not raised before the district_court and are therefore waived
nevertheless on balance of the evidence in the record we conclude that the first and fourth_factors heavily favor a stay

iii
factor b whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has been set
the court found that the timing_factor favored granting a stay because the parties had not yet filed their joint claim_construction statement the deadline to complete fact_discovery was more than six months away and jury_selection was not until november 2014
virtualagility 2014_wl_94371 at *5 ; see docket control order virtualagility_inc. v. salesforce.com inc. 13-cv-00111 e.d.tex
aug._30,_2013 ecf no._91
but it concluded that` the benefits of a stay at this relatively early_stage of the proceedings are outweighed by various other considerations as discussed elsewhere herein'
virtualagility 2014_wl_94371 at *5

defendants argue that the district_court correctly concluded that the early_stage of the litigation favors a stay
defendants contend however that the district_court did not weigh this factor heavily enough in favor of the stay because it erroneously considered the cases status at the time it ruled on the motion rather than at the time when the motion was filed-seven months earlier
they argue that when considering a motion to stay it does not make sense for a district_court to take into account its added familiarity with the case developed during the pendency of the motion
defendants note that at the time of the filing there was no date for jury_selection and no discovery had taken place

va counters that the district_court correctly evaluated the status of the case on the date when it ruled on the motion rather than when the motion was filed because there was no indication that the ptab would initiate cbm_review when defendants moved for a stay
va notes that at the time the district_court ruled on the motion to stay the parties were involved in fact_discovery and were preparing for a claim_construction_hearing which it contends indicates that the case was at an advanced stage
va thus argues that the timing_factor is neutral

we hold that the timing_factor heavily favors a stay
we note at the outset that it was not error for the district_court to wait until the ptab made its decision to institute cbm_review before it ruled on the motion
indeed while some district_courts ruled on motions to stay before the ptab granted the petition for post-grant review see e.g. intertainer inc. v. hulu llc no._13- cv-5499 2014_wl_466034 at *1 c.d.cal
jan._24,_2014 others have *1316 waited until post-grant review was instituted and still others denied as premature the motion to stay without prejudice to refiling after institution of post-grant review see e.g. checkfree corp. v. metavante corp. no._12- cv-15 2014_wl_466023 at *1 m.d.fla
jan._17,_2014
we express no opinion on which is the better practice
while a motion to stay could be granted even before the ptab rules on a post-grant review petition no doubt the case for a stay is stronger after post-grant review has been instituted

in this case the stay_motion was filed in may 2013 almost immediately after salesforce had filed its cbm_petition with the ptab
the ptab granted the petition in november 2013
the district_court denied the motion to stay in january 2014
as noted above we see no error in the district_courts decision to rule on the stay_motion after the ptab rendered its decision on the cbm_petition
furthermore a district_court is not obligated to` freeze' its proceedings between the date that the motion to stay is filed and the date that the ptab decides on the cbm_petition
of course the court should make every effort to expeditiously resolve the stay_motion after the ptab has made its cbm_review determination
to do otherwise would undermine the intent of congress to allow for stays to prevent unnecessary duplication of proceedings

as for the proper time to measure the stage of litigation district_courts have adopted the date of the filing of the motion to stay
see e.g. norred v. medtronic inc. no._13- 2061 2014_wl_554685 at *2 d.kan
feb._12,_2014` the court finds that this case is still in its early_stages with the scheduling order entered only a few months before this motion was filed
`` ; cynosure inc. v. cooltouch inc. no._08-10026 2009_wl_2462565 at *2 d.mass
aug._10,_2009` the most compelling justification for denying defendants motion to stay is the stage of the litigation at which it was filed'
( emphasis added ; agar corp. inc. v. multi-fluid inc. 983_f.supp._1126 1127 s.d.tex.1997 articulating the timing_factor as` the stage of the litigation at which the motion was filed'
the cases cited by the dissent are not to the contrary and do not hold that the stage of litigation is measured as of any date other than the date of the motion.5 in two of the cases cited by the dissent the motion was decided within weeks of its filing and thus the stage of litigation discussed was effectively the stage of the filing of the motion

nov._13,_2013 motion to stay filed in late september 2013
in the third case it is clear that the district_court used the time of the filing of the motion for a stay to evaluate the stage of litigation
boston_scientific_corp. v. cordis_corp. 777_f.supp.2d_783_(d.del.2011)
the court explained that the stage of litigation cuts against a stay because discovery is complete and the trial is scheduled to commence in may 2011
id.at 788
although it is not apparent from this portion of the opinion at what time the stage of litigation was measured the district_court later made clear that it looked at the time of the filing of the motion` cordis motion for *1317 stay was filed on september 23 2010 nearly one year after the untimely request for reexamination was made
as noted above [ in thestatus of litigation section ] a trial_date had been set and fact_discovery was complete at the time cordis filed its motion for stay'
id.at 789

generally the time of the motion is the relevant_time to measure the stage of litigation.6 in this case we see no error in the district_courts having waited until the ptab granted the cbm_review to rule upon the motion
whether we consider the may 2013 date when the motion to stay was filed or the november 2013 date when the ptab granted cbm_review this factor heavily favors defendants
at the time defendants filed their motion in may 2013 the case was less than four months old
discovery had not yet begun and no trial_date had been set
as of the date the ptab granted cbm_review there remained eight months of fact_discovery the joint claim_construction statements had yet to be filed and jury_selection was a year away
the litigation at either time was still at its infancy which favors granting the stay

iv
factor c undue prejudice or tactical advantage
the district_court concluded that the undue_prejudice_factor weighed heavily against a stay
it found that given` credible evidence' that va and salesforce were direct_competitors va would suffer irreparable_harm in the form of lost market_share and consumer_goodwill stemming from the delay in enforcing its patent_rights
virtualagility 2014_wl_94371 at *6
the court noted that for example va and salesforce` took part in the same government bid process at least once'
id
it determined that even though cbm_review must conclude by november 2014 i.e. one year from institution of the proceeding see 35 u.s.c.¡± 326 a 117 va would still suffer undue_prejudice because it is a small_company with limited_resources and because a likely_appeal would impose further delay
the court also found that va would be unduly prejudiced` because certain identified witnesses are of an advanced_age'
id.at 7
finally the court refused to weigh the fact that va did not move for a preliminary_injunction against va stating that it was not` in a role to judge the parties litigation_strategy'
id

defendants argue that the district_court erred in concluding that a stay would unduly prejudice va
they contend that va will not suffer undue_prejudice because the timeframe for cbm_review is short
they argue that in any event mere delay in having ones claim adjudicated does not constitute undue_prejudice
defendants argue that va has not identified any actual risk of fading memories or potentially unavailable evidence
defendants further contend that va could be adequately compensated by money damages
they argue that the district_court clearly erred in finding that va and salesforce competed for the same bid and that va has not proven that it would lose market_share or goodwill due to a delay in the resolution of its *1318 infringement case
defendants contend that the fact that va did not move for a preliminary_injunction suggests that va is not truly concerned about a delay

va counters that a delay will subject it to undue_prejudice by significantly harming its business
it argues that the fate of the ¡¬413_patent_claims would almost certainly not be known until after the statutory november 2014 deadline because of the likely_appeal of the ptabs decision and due to other potential delays
it contends that defendants argument that va and salesforce are not true competitors is meritless in view of record evidence that the two companies compete in the same_market
va argues that expeditious enforcement of its patent_rights against larger competitors like salesforce is critical to protecting its market_share and that a permanent_injunction would thus be` very likely' if it succeeded in proving infringement
appellees br

it further argues that the district_courts fast schedule made it unnecessary to move for a preliminary_injunction
finally va contends that the district_court did not err in concluding that loss of evidence during the pendency of cbm_review is likely and that regardless defendants waived the argument that loss of evidence was not a concern

we conclude that the district_court clearly erred in finding that the undue_prejudice_factor weighed heavily against a stay
at best this factor weighs slightly against a stay
we agree with the district_court that competition between parties can weigh in favor of finding undue_prejudice
see e.g. market-alerts pty ltd. v. bloomberg_fin
l.p. 922_f.supp.2d_486 494-95 d.del.2013
there is evidence in this record that salesforce and va are in the same business space
the record indicates that salesforce provides cloud-based enterprise-level information technology solutions j.a
339 344 and so does va j.a
315-16
in addition both companies target public-sector customers
j.a
316-17 323-27
but as to evidence of direct_competition the record establishes only that salesforce was mentioned in a government services administration gsa bid which va received identifying salesforces products as the brand name reference products
j.a
316 322-37
va admitted during oral argument however that this gsa bid was a small business set-aside for which salesforce a large business could not compete

cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl & 2014-1232.mp3
thus there is no evidence in this record that the two companies ever competed for the same customer or contract
we acknowledge however that direct evidence of such competition is not required to establish that va and salesforce are competitors especially at such an early_stage of the proceedings
see moleculon research corp. v. cbs inc. 793_f.2d_1261 1271 fed.cir.1986 abrogated on other grounds by egyptian goddess inc. v. swisa inc. 543_f.3d_665_(fed.cir.2008) en banc` [ d ] irect evidence of a fact is not necessary`
we do credit the district_courts finding that loss of market_share and consumer_goodwill is high in the growing market of cloud-computing

of course whether the patentee will be unduly prejudiced by a stay in the district_court_proceedings during the cbm_review like the irreparable_harm-type inquiry focuses on the patentees need for an expeditious resolution of its claim
a stay will not diminish the monetary damages to which va will be entitled if it succeeds in its infringement suit-it only delays realization of those damages and delays any potential injunctive remedy
va argues that it needs injunctive_relief as soon as possible to prevent irreparable_harm to its business indicating that even a one-to *1319 two-year delay in the adjudication of its infringement claims would subject it to undue_prejudice because va and salesforce compete in the same_market

june_20,_2013 ecf no._72
although this is not dispositive we note that va did not move for a preliminary_injunction against defendants
we acknowledge as the district_court did that there could be a variety of reasons that a patentee does not move for a preliminary_injunction
see e.g. nippon steel & sumito metal corp. v. posco no._12- 2429 2013_wl_1867042 at *big_token__6_n._6_ d.n.j._may_2 _2013 __big_token ; nat l prods. inc. v. gamber-johnson llc 12-cv-00840 2012_wl_3527938 at *big_token__3_n._5_ w.d.wash._aug._14 _2012 __big_token ; cooper notification inc. v. twitter inc. no._09-865 2010_wl_5149351 at *4 d.del

lit
495 534 2003
in this case va argues that it did not move for a preliminary_injunction because it is a small_company with limited_resources and that the litigation process would move fast enough to make this unnecessary

vas arguments are rational reasons for not pursuing a preliminary_injunction but the fact that it was not worth the expense to ask for this remedy contradicts vas assertion that it needs injunctive_relief as soon as possible
we also note that va for some unexplained reason waited nearly a year after the ¡¬413_patent issued before it filed suit against defendants
these facts weigh against vas claims that it will be unduly prejudiced by a stay

to the extent that the district_court found that` the added risk of witness loss' could unduly prejudice plaintiff we do not agree that this record supports a conclusion of undue_prejudice
va asserts that one potentially relevant witness is` over 60' and three others are` over 70'
since when did 60 become so old ?
it is undoubtedly true as many courts have observed that with age and the passage of time memories may fade and witnesses may become unavailable
without more however these assertions here are not sufficient to justify a conclusion of undue_prejudice
there is no evidence that any of these individuals are in ill health and at least one of the older witnesses has already been deposed
in addition rule 27 of the federal_rules of civil procedure allows for the perpetuation of testimony when facts suggest that such action may be necessary
this rule gives district_courts the authority to grant a petition authorizing a deposition to perpetuate testimony even before a lawsuit has been brought and also applies when a case is otherwise stayed
see texaco inc. v. borda 383_f.2d_607 609 3d cir.1967 concerns over advanced_age of a witness could be alleviated by permitting a deposition to preserve testimony and did not prevent a stay
the advanced_age of witnesses is a factor relevant to potential prejudice but the prejudice can be reduced when necessary by preserving the testimony
we conclude that this record does not support the conclusion that va would be unduly prejudiced by the stay

finally the district_court did not find that a stay would give defendants a clear_tactical_advantage and we agree
there is no evidence that defendants possessed a` dilatory motive' which would have pointed against a stay
see e.g. market-alerts 922 f.supp.2d at 495-96
in fact salesforce filed its cbm_petition less than four months after va instituted this infringement_action and moved to stay the district_court_proceedings almost immediately *1320 after filing the petition
to the district_court va argued that salesforce` could have used but deliberately and tactically withheld from the post-grant proceeding' the so-called` oracle_projects' prior_art
vas response in opposition to defendants joint_motion to stay proceedings at 1
defendants responded that salesforce did not include oracle_projects in the cbm_petition because it is` a proprietary software system not strictly a printed publication of the type typically considered by the pto' and would require testimony from` live third party witnesses at trial'

in some circumstances a defendants decision to save key pieces of prior_art for district_court_litigation in case its cbm challenge fails would weigh against a stay
even though the` splitting' of prior_art is allowed by statute in the sense that litigation estoppel does not attach to art that could have been but was not raised in cbm_review such behavior can still give the movant a clear_tactical_advantage within the meaning of ¡± 18.8 this record does not establish such a clear_tactical_advantage given the uncontradicted evidence that at the time salesforce filed its cbm_petition it did not have the evidence necessary to include the oracle_projects and tecskor prior_art
given these unusual circumstances we conclude that there is no clear_tactical_advantage to defendants of granting the stay

on this record the evidence of competition is weak and the patentees delays in pursuing suit and seeking preliminary injunctive_relief belie its claims that it will be unduly prejudiced by a stay
we conclude that the district_court clearly erred in concluding that undue_prejudice here weighs heavily against granting the stay
at best under the clear error standard this factor weighs slightly against a stay on this record

* * * * * *

three of the four factors weigh heavily in favor of a stay in this case simplification of the issues and streamlining of the trial whether discovery is complete and a trial_date has been set and reduction of the burden of litigation on the parties and the court
the undue_prejudice_factor at best weighs slightly in favor of denying a stay
on this record we conclude that the district_court abused its discretion when it denied the stay

conclusion
we reverse the district_courts order denying defendants motion for a stay of the district_court_proceedings pending cbm_review and remand with instructions to grant the motion

newman circuit_judge dissenting
the america_invents_act permits but does not require the district_court to stay earlier-filed litigation during later-requested post-grant pto proceedings
such a stay is not obligatory but is consigned to the district_courts discretion
during consideration of the proposed post-grant review legislation there was extensive debate about the relation between concurrent infringement_actions in the courts and post-grant patentability redeterminations in the pto
after eight years of discussion the america_invents_act adopted rules for concurrent proceedings in various circumstances
no statute or rule requires the district_court to stay ongoing court proceedings after a petition for post-grant review is filed in the pto
my colleagues contrary ruling today is also contrary to the legislation and its purpose

the decision of a trial_judge not to stay an infringement_action in litigation when the defendant requests a stay but the plaintiff wishes to proceed is consigned to the discretion of the judge
here the plaintiff objected to the stay and the district_court exercised its discretion and denied the stay
nonetheless my colleagues reverse the district_court and grant the stay although it is not shown that the district_court abused its discretion

the district_court may choose to stay its proceedings when the interest of justice warrants and the aia lists several factors for the court to consider in deciding how to exercise its discretion in a particular_case
however a stay of litigation is not available as a matter of right when a petition for post-grant review is filed in the pto.1 see commodity futures trading comm n v. schor 478_u.s._833 850 106_s.ct._3245 92_l.ed.2d_675_(1986)` article iii ¡± 1 preserves to litigants their interest in an impartial and independent federal adjudication of claims within the judicial power of the united states..'

in this case the district_court applied the traditional stay factors as recorded in aia_section 18 b and ruled that stay of the ongoing judicial proceeding was inappropriate
the district_court exercised its discretion to continue with the trial which was on a fast track to completion
this ruling is well within the district_courts statutory and discretionary_authority

although the covered business method cbm statute provides that appellate review of a district_courts decision to grant or deny a stay` may be de novo' when the district_courts decision is within its range of discretion it warrants appellate respect
my colleagues on this panel do not identify any abuse of the district_courts discretion ; nor do they acknowledge the deference owed to a trial_judge in rulings on matters of equity and the balance of interests

i respectfully dissent

discussion
a stay is an` intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial_review and accordingly is not a matter of right even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the appellant'
nken v. holder 556_u.s._418 427 129_s.ct._1749 173_l.ed.2d_550_(2009)
section 18 b 1 of the america_invents_act authorizes the district_court to stay the litigation of a patent for which cbm_review in the pto has been requested
such a stay is not *1322 automatic ; the statute authorizes the district_court in its discretion to stay its proceedings on taking into account certain equitable factors as may exist in the particular_case

in todays ruling the panel_majority overrides the district_courts discretion and effectively creates a rule that stays of district_court_litigation pending cbm_review must always be granted
here the district_court carefully considered the four factors set out in the statute and concluded that virtualagility is likely to be harmed disproportionately in both the litigation and the marketplace if the defendants are allowed to draw out this case for an extended period all the while continuing to infringe a presumptively valid patent
the district_court considered the phase of the litigation the completion of document_production and much of discovery and the early trial_date and exercised its discretion to proceed with the trial proceedings
whether or not my colleagues prolongation of the dispute by way of a potential multiplicity of administrative trials and appeals can be defended the district_courts evaluation of the equities is reasonable is consistent with the analyses by other district_courts and warrants deference

the near automatic grant of litigation stays today engrafted onto the statute tilts the legislated balance for the statute recognized that a stay pending cbm_review may depending on the circumstances lead to inequity and tactical abuse
see tuitionfund llc v. suntrust banks inc. 2012_wl_4758382 at *1 m.d.tenn
oct._5,_2012` further there may be tactical_advantages to the vesdia defendants in seeking a stay the most apparent being delay
`` ; bausch & lomb inc. v. rexall sundown inc. 554_f.supp.2d_386 389 w.d.n.y.2008` resort to the reexamination procedure should not be sanctioned through the issuance of a stay however where it is pursued for tactical_advantage after substantial and costly discovery has been conducted or where trial is imminent
``

successive proceedings can add extensive delay to final resolution while the patent life continues to expiration
the district_court emphasized the heavy impact of delay on this patentee
deference is owed to the district_courts assessment for the trial_court is in a better position than either the pto or this court to attune a request for stay to the particular situation

the district_court has discretionary_authority to manage its cases as well as to consider equitable factors
the supreme_court has recognized this authority see landis v. north american co. 299_u.s._248 254-55 57_s.ct._163 81_l.ed._153_(1936) discussing power and circumstances of stay of proceedings stating that` only in rare circumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand aside while a litigant in another settles the rule of law that will define the rights of both
`` as has the federal_circuit see viskase corp. v. american national can co. 261_f.3d_1316 1328 fed.cir.2001` the court is not required to stay judicial resolution in view of the reexaminations`
indeed the party appealing denial of a stay historically faced a steeper burden because the appeal seeks` interference by an appellate_court with management of proceedings entrusted to the district_court'

sys. inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 134_s.ct._1744 188_l.ed.2d_829_(2014) the supreme_court discussed the rationale for abuse of discretion review in the context of the patent acts fee-shifting provisions
the court stated that as a matter of the sound administration of justice the district_court is better positioned to decide whether a case is exceptional because it has lived with the case over a prolonged period
the court observed that the fee shifting question is` multifarious and novel' and not susceptible to` useful_generalization' of the sort that de novo_review provides but is more` likely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of-discretion rule will permit to develop'
id.at 1748-49

the courts reasoning in highmark applies forcefully to a district_courts exercise of discretion in deciding whether to stay pending litigation despite the patentees objection
the inquiry created by the aias four factor_test is highly fact specific not susceptible to` useful_generalization ;' the district_court is better positioned to decide whether a stay serves the best balance of interests of the parties and the court
my colleagues on this panel ignore this reality

depending on the stage of the litigation as the aia provides a court may conclude within its discretion that` the principle of maximizing the use of judicial and litigant_resources is best served by seeing the case through to its conclusion'

several courts have expressed concern that a stay will interfere with their ability to manage their dockets and fulfill their judicial responsibilities

this consideration weighs against a stay
universal_elecs. inc. v. universal remote control inc. 943_f.supp.2d_1028 1035 c.d.cal.2013
the panel_majority does not acknowledge these concerns

aia_section 18 b lists four factors relevant to evaluation of a stay_request
in this case the district_court conscientiously applied this framework and on consideration of the nature of the patent this cases trial schedule and the competitive_relationship between the parties the court concluded that the potential benefits of a stay are outweighed by the harm that virtualagility is likely to experience in both the litigation and the marketplace if a stay were granted

the district_courts analysis of the four factors represents a consistent_application of precedent and neither the appellants nor the panel_majority have shown that the balance reached by the court is an abuse of discretion
i briefly review the four statutory_factors set forth in aia section 18 b 1' a whether a stay or the denial thereof will simplify the issues in question and streamline the trial'

the court emphasized` the thoroughness of the ptos prior_examination of the ¡¬413_patent during which time more *1324 than sixty prior_art_references were considered' contrasting it to` more common business_method_patents' which congress explained` have not been thoroughly reviewed at the pto due to a lack of the best prior_art'
id.at *3
the court stated that it was not persuaded that the single prior_art reference at issue in this cbm_review would invalidate all or a substantial number of the asserted_claims and as a result the court would almost certainly need to consider other prior_art_references including two which appellants have alleged are` of particular_importance'
id

the district_court was also not persuaded that the ptab would be likely to cancel all claims of the ¡¬413_patent under ¡± 101 citing` even greater uncertainty with respect to the ptabs ¡± 101 determination'
id.at *4
the court concluded that it was` not convinced that granting a stay will simplify the issues in this case'
id.at *5

the district_court correctly recognized that if one claim were to survive cbm_review a stay would not simplify the litigation issues in this case
there would still be full litigation of invalidity_issues ; the elimination of one reference of the almost fifty references that the defendants placed at issue in the district_court would not simplify this case
in addition the defendants in the district_court_litigation raised invalidity defenses under sections 103 112 and 256 whereas the cbm_proceeding involves only sections 101_and_102
unless each and every claim is invalidated in the cbm_review the district_court was correct that a stay will simply increase the burden on the parties

the majority states that it reached its decision on this factor without considering possible amendment to the claims
the pto record states that virtualagilitys proposed amendments` are strictly contingent on the board finding each respective original independent claim unpatentable'
patent owners contingent motion to amend dkt
no._137-1
the district_court undertook a detailed review of the proposed amendments and concluded that in the unlikely event the amendments would affect the courts claim_construction supplemental_claim_construction could be considered
the court stated inconsistency would only arise under the narrow contingency that this court sides with defendants in construingprocessor andstorage device and the ptab adopts plaintiffs proposed substitute claim 28 after finding that the original claim 7 is unpatentable
if this does occur the court will consider holding a supplemental_claim_construction on these two terms to resolve the conflict
in any event the proposed amendments would not alter the construction of the remaining seven disputed claim terms

`` b whether discovery is complete and whether a trial_date has been set'

the district_court discussed the stage of document_production and depositions which were proceeding toward a trial_date of november 2014 but were not yet complete

as previously mentioned the parties have also fully briefed and argued the claim_construction_issues and the court is currently working on its order construing the claims at issue

maj. op.at 1317
it can not be correct to hold that all interim activity must be ignored and the stay decided as if nothing had occurred.2 such a rule contravenes the principle that when` the court and the parties have already expended significant resources on the litigation the principle of maximizing the use of judicial and litigant_resources is best served by seeing the case through to its conclusion'

the district_court explained that courts are reluctant to stay proceedings where the parties are direct_competitors and observed that the` loss of market_share and consumer_goodwill is particularly high in the growing market of enterprise_cloud-computing where contractors and governmental agencies are developing lists of preferred vendors'

the court concluded that granting a stay would unduly prejudice virtualagility both in the marketplace and in this litigation

the district_court found that salesforce and virtualagility` directly compete in at least the enterprise_cloud computing market targeting public_sector_entities'

the panel_majority states that there was no evidence of direct_competition
that is contrary to the record

virtualagilitys president and chief executive officer stated that he has` personally had conversations with virtualagility customers and potential customers in which the customer or potential customer compares the functionality of virtualagilitys products with that of salesforces products'

the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the parties directly compete in the enterprise_cloud computing market targeting public_sector_entities

the panel_majority acknowledges the district_courts undue_prejudice findings but gives them scant weight
instead my colleagues fault virtualagility for not moving for a preliminary_injunction
maj. op.at 1320
the district_court presented a perceptive analysis of this position a partys decision to seek or not seek a preliminary_injunction often rests upon a variety of factors including that partys resources the uncertainty of the outcome or as part of an overall strategy to streamline the process and focus on other procedural steps in the litigation
not being in a role to judge the parties litigation_strategy the court deems it unfair to hold virtualagility to *1327 a position based upon what is no more than a dubious implication
dct
op.at *7

a preliminary_injunction proceeding often delays the litigation and it is a truism that interim relief is not easy to obtain
the district_court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold virtualagilitys reasonable choice against it

oct._7,_2013 collecting cases on the significance of failure to seek a preliminary_injunction

the district_court here gave weight to virtualagilitys small size and limited_resources the competitive_relationship between the parties and the high potential for loss of market_share and consumer_goodwill in the market in which they compete
the court concluded that a stay may cause` outsized consequences' to virtualagility

op.at *5
the district_court reasonably weighed the undue_prejudice_factor heavily against granting a stay
`` d whether a stay or the denial thereof will reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and on the court'

with the stay now imposed by my colleagues virtualagility will undergo an inter_partes trial in the ptab on some but not all of the invalidity_issues that the defendants raised in the district_court
whichever side loses in the pto then has the right first to request reconsideration by the ptab and then the right of judicial_review of the pto decision
unless all of virtualagilitys patent claims are finally eliminated in the pto and that ruling sustained on appeal the procedure could be repeated in the district_court
the district_court has discretion to consider this tactical reality in exercising its discretion to weigh the burden of litigation on the parties and the court

it is apparent that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in weighing and balancing the statutory_factors and declining to stay its proceedings

conclusion
the panel_majority has imposed greater rigor on` stay' considerations than the statute warrants
post-grant review in the pto is a useful tool but the principle of post-grant review does not require elimination of judicial discretion to proceed with pending litigation
indeed the america_invents_act contemplates such discretion
i must respectfully dissent from my colleagues distortion of the statutory plan

as the petitioner in the cbm_proceeding salesforce is estopped from asserting at the district_court that the ¡¬413_patent_claims are` invalid on any ground that [ it ] raised during the..
proceeding'

although this provision does not apply to the other non-petitioner defendants in this case` all other_defendants will agree to this same scope of statutory estoppel' if a stay pending cbm_review is granted

3
it would also be inappropriate for the district_court to evaluate the potential success of an apa challenge to the ptabs determination that the ¡¬413_patent is a` covered business_method_patent' when analyzing whether cbm_review will simplify the issues and reduce the burdens on the parties and the court
like the district_courts validity analysis this inquiry would amount to an improper_collateral_attack on the ptabs decision to institute cbm_review
4
we note that while the same pieces of evidence can often relate to both the first and the fourth_factors as they do here this may not always be the case
while simplifying issues would as a general matter always reduce the burdens of litigation on the parties and the court the reduced_burden of litigation_factor may implicate other considerations such as the number of plaintiffs and defendants the parties and witnesses places of residence issues of convenience the courts docket and in particular its potential familiarity with the patents at issue
5
the dissent is correct that some cases discuss the time of the motion in conjunction with the prejudice_factor because those cases were considering whether defendants delays in seeking a stay would unduly prejudice the plaintiff-an entirely different issue
none of those cases suggests however that the stage of the litigation should be anything other than the time of the filing of the motion
6
while district_courts should generally consider` whether discovery is complete and whether a trial_date has been set' as of the date of the stay_motion there was no error in also taking into account the stage of litigation as of the date that cbm_review was granted
similarly the district_court may consider evidence that develops after the date of the stay_motion-for example the fact that the ptab granted the cbm_petition any claim_amendments proposed or entered in the post-grant proceeding further evidence of competition and so on-as it pertains to the other three factors

we note however that it may not be necessary or even prudent in some situations for the petitioner to provide all known prior_art no matter how irrelevant or redundant to the ptab during cbm_review
failure to advance irrelevant or redundant prior_art would not demonstrate a clear_tactical_advantage

compare 28 u.s.c.¡± 1659 a giving a party in district_court the absolute right to a stay when there is a concurrent action in the international trade commission provided only that the stay_request is made 30 days after the party is named as a respondent or 30 days after the district_court action is filed whichever is later

in some jurisdictions the district_court case may have received major effort in the interim
it is reported that for patent litigation cases filed in the fast track eastern district of virginia between 2000_and_2010 the average trial was completed less than a year after the case was filed
