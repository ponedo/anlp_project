background
luniewski was employed by shamrock_technologies inc. shamrock between may 1980 and july 1983
as a condition of employment he agreed to assign his work-related inventions to shamrock
luniewski and william neuberg jointly invented an apparatus and method for processing_polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe with radiation
on march_26,_1982 luniewski assigned his rights in the inventions to shamrock
patent applications were filed on may_3,_1982 and july_22,_1983
having signed declarations to be filed with the patent_applications luniewski left shamrock in july 1983 and joined msi as vice president in charge of operations
thereafter msi began radiation_processing of ptfe ; first by an` original_process' and after this suit was commenced by a` current_process'1

on may_31,_1988 and october 11 1988 respectively the applications issued as united_states patent nos._4748,005005 apparatus and 4,777,192192 method
on may_31,_1988 shamrock sued msi and luniewski for infringement of its005_patent
msi and luniewski counterclaimed for a declaration of invalidity
in an october 13 1988` memorandum of decision and order' the district_court applied the doctrine of assignor_estoppel and granted shamrocks partial summary_judgment motion to strike affirmative_defenses and to dismiss the counterclaim
the district_court rejected the arguments that the assignment was fraudulently obtained and that privity was lacking between luniewski and msi.2

on november 18 1988 shamrock amended its complaint asserting infringement of the192_patent

in an august 8 1989` memorandum of decision and order' the district_court rejected a request to withdraw the october 13 1988 order and entered summary_judgment that 1 the affirmative_defenses and counterclaim relating to invalidity of the192_patent were barred by assignor_estoppel ; 2 the defense of unenforceability of both patents was barred by assignor_estoppel ; and 3 the accused original and current_processes infringed the patents
on august 24 1989 the district_court entered a` final partial judgment' pursuant to rule 54 b fed.r.civ.p.,3 holding the patents not invalid enforceable and infringed *791 and enjoining msi and luniewski from further_infringement

issues
1
whether the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment of infringement

2
whether the district_court erred in holding that assignor_estoppel precluded the invalidity and unenforceability defenses

opinion
summary judgment is appropriate where` there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact' and` the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 c ; celotex corp. v. catrett 477_u.s._317 322-23 106_s.ct._2548 2552 91_l.ed.2d_265_(1986)
the facts are undisputed and we have been shown no error in the district_courts application of the law

a
infringement
1
the claimed inventions
the005_patent is directed to an apparatus for processing high_molecular_weight flowable solid polytetrafluoroethylene
claim 1 is representative:4

apparatus for batch radiation_processing of a high_molecular_weight flowable_solid_polytetrafluoroethylene_material to degrade said material to lower its molecular_weight and render it grindable into a powder comprising a processing_vessel for holding a batch of said material during processing a source of particle_radiation for supplying radiation to a selected region of said processing_vessel mechanical_stirring_means for agitating said material in said processing_vessel during said processing thereby to repeatedly move said material into and out of said selected region whereby said material is uniformly irradiated and water cooling means for maintaining said vessel and said material below a selected temperature during said processing
the192_patent resulted from a continuation-in-part of the application that resulted in the005_patent and is directed to a method for processing ptfe
claim 1 is representative a method for processing flowable_solid_polytetrafluoroethylene_material by radiation to degrade said material to lower its molecular_weight and render it grindable into a powder comprising
( a supplying said material to a processing_vessel b supplying radiation to a selected region of said processing_vessel c agitating said material in said processing_vessel during said processing thereby to repeatedly move said material into and out of said selected region whereby said material is uniformly irradiated and d cooling said material to maintain a temperature below 500¢X_f. during said processing

2
the accused processes
appellants admitted that their original_process involved a processing_vessel for holding ptfe during processing a source of particle_radiation for supplying radiation to a portion of said vessel mechanical_stirring_means for agitating the ptfe in the vessel during processing in such manner that the ptfe repeatedly moves into and out of the region being irradiated and injection of water into the ptfe to cool it during processing

the current_process differs from the original in that agitation is achieved with air_pressure and paddles air cooling has replaced water cooling and an air classifier extracts particles of ptfe from the vessel

3
the disputed claim limitations
appellants focus on four claim limitations and their use of a prior_art_step but fail to establish the presence of genuine_issues of material_fact
though the district_court said both patents are infringed *792 by both processes it is sufficient to note the correctness of its judgment based on infringement of the005_patent by the original_process and infringement of the192_patent by the current_process
see fromson v. advance offset plate inc. 755_f.2d_1549 1556 225_uspq_26 31 fed.cir.1985 we review judgments not opinions ; lee v. united_states 809_f.2d_1406 1408 9th cir.1987 cert
denied sub nom
lee v. eklutna 484_u.s._1041 108_s.ct._772 98_l.ed.2d_859_(1988) judgment may be affirmed on` any ground fairly supported by the record'

( a` uniformly irradiated' the district_court correctly looked to the specifications and prosecution histories of the patents to illuminate the meaning of` uniformly irradiated'
loctite corp. v. ultraseal ltd. 781_f.2d_861 867 228_uspq_90 93 fed.cir.1985
the specifications point out that the prior_art irradiated trays of ptfe on a conveyor belt with upper layers of ptfe receiving more irradiation than lower layers
hence the district_court did not err in determining that` uniformly irradiated' refers to` more consistent exposure' of ptfe to radiation as contrasted with the` uneven irradiation' provided by the prior_art
appellants argument that some of their ptfe granules melt and some are removed by an air classifier may at most indicate that they may not achieve perfect uniformity of radiation but the district_court correctly determined that the claim does not require absolute uniformity
inefficient infringement is infringement still
laitram corp. v. cambridge wire cloth co. 863_f.2d_855 859 9_uspq2d_1289 1294 fed.cir.1988
the accused processes clearly fall within the scope of the` uniformly irradiated' limitation properly construed

( b` into and out of' appellants argument that because the current_process uses paddles and air_pressure to agitate ptfe it does not meet this limitation was correctly rejected by district_court as` meritless'

( c` water cooling means for maintaining said vessel and [ the ptfe ] below a selected temperature during processing' appellants say their spraying of water directly on the ptfe in the original_process avoids this limitation because the005 specification discloses a water jacket precluding contact between the water and the ptfe
the record however supplies no basis for reading the claim as limited to a water jacket or as precluding direct spraying of the ptfe
see e.i
dupont_de_nemours & co. v. phillips petroleum co. 849_f.2d_1430 1433 7_uspq2d_1129 1131 fed.cir.1988 ; loctite 781 f.2d at 867 228 uspq at 93` [ g ] enerally particular limitations or embodiments appearing in the specification will not be read into the claims`
moreover appellants admit that their vessel is` cooler than it would otherwise be without the addition of water [ by spraying ]
`` 5

( d` ptfe temperature below 500¢X_f.' appellants say there is no evidence that their current_process meets this limitation
we fully agree with the district_courts analysis [ appellants ] do not assert that their processes involve temperatures above 500¢X_f. but merely that the temperature is below 620¢X
although [ appellants ] are correct in asserting that on a motion for summary_judgment all inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmovant it has been held that the nonmovant must do more than merely present some evidence on an issue it asserts is disputed
sufficient evidence for a jury to return a verdict in favor of the nonmovant must be forthcoming
a.b
chance co. v. rte co. [ corp. ] 854_f.2d_1307 1311 [ 7_uspq2d_1881 1884 ] fed.cir.1988 citing *793 avia [ group int l inc. v. l.a. gear california inc. 853_f.2d_1557 1560 7_uspq2d_1548 1550 fed.cir.1988 ]
here not only have [ appellants ] failed to offer any evidence on the issue of temperature but there is no indication that any such evidence is forthcoming
therefore the suggestion that there may exist a difference in temperature between the patent claims and the processes used by [ appellants ] is not a genuine_issue that would preclude a summary_judgment of infringement
( footnote omitted

( e prior art step
the district_court correctly noted that appellants use of the prior_art_step of grinding was incidental and insignificant
the argument that infringement is avoided by adding a prior_art_step is fallacious
no claim limitation precludes use of simultaneous grinding and irradiation and no basis appears in the record for reading such a limitation into the claims
see e.i
dupont_de_nemours & co. 849 f.2d at 1433 7 uspq2d at 1131

b. assignor estoppel
in diamond_scientific co. v. ambico inc. 848_f.2d_1220 1224 6_uspq2d_2028 2031 fed.cir
) cert
dismissed 487_u.s._1265 109_s.ct._28 101_l.ed.2d_978_(1988) we reaffirmed the doctrine of assignor_estoppel which precludes a patent assignor and those in privity with the assignor from contending that the patent is a nullity

appellants argue that applying assignor_estoppel was error because 1 msi is not in privity with luniewski 2 luniewski was misled and under duress when he signed the declarations and 3 the inequitable_conduct_defense is not subject to assignor_estoppel

1
privity
assignor estoppel is an equitable_doctrine id.at 1224 6 uspq2d at 2030` that is mainly concerned with the balance of the equities between the parties'
id.at 1225 6 uspq2d at 2031
those in privity with the assignor partake of that balance ; hence extension of the estoppel to those in privity is justified
see id.at 1224 6 uspq2d at 2030

what constitutes` privity' varies depending on the purpose for which privity is asserted
see american mach co. v. everedy mach co. 35_f.2d_526 528 3_uspq_196 198 e.d.pa.1929 distinguishing use of privity for estoppel from use of privity for imposition of personal liability ; national_cash_register_co. v. remington_arms_co. 283_fed._196 201 d.del.1922 affd 286_fed._367_(3d_cir.1923) distinguishing subordinate in privity with principal from the reverse

privity like the doctrine of assignor_estoppel itself is determined upon a balance of the equities
if an inventor assigns his invention to his employer company a and leaves to join company_b whether company_b is in privity and thus bound by the doctrine will depend on the equities dictated by the relationship between the inventor and company_b in light of the act of infringement
the closer that relationship the more the equities will favor applying the doctrine to company_b
see e.g. douglass v. united_states_appliance_corp. 177_f.2d_98 101 83_uspq_41 42-43 9th cir.1949 no privity between assignor and remote successors in interest ; united_states_appliance_corp. v. beauty shop supply co. 121_f.2d_149 151 50_uspq_40 42-43 9th cir
) cert
denied 314_u.s._680 62_s.ct._180 86_l.ed._544_(1941) privity between assignor and co-developer of infringing device with company they formed to advance their interests in infringing device ; stubnitz-greene spring corp. v. fort pitt bedding co. 110_f.2d_192 195 45_uspq_52 55 6th cir.1940 privity between assignor and company of which he was principal stockholder president and general manager ; buckingham prods co. v. mcaleer mfg co. 108_f.2d_192 195 44_uspq_91 95 6th cir.1939 privity between assignor and corporation over which he had control of policy but lacked voting control ; frick co. v. lindsay 27_f.2d_59 61 4th cir.1928 wife in privity with husband/partner in business infringing patent ; mellor v. carroll 141_f._992 993-94 c.c.d.mass.1905 privity *794 between assignor and others who availed themselves of assignors knowledge and assistance to conduct infringement

the district_court correctly determined that considering the balance of equities and the relationship of luniewski and msi no genuine_issue of material_fact exists regarding privity in this case
the undisputed_facts are 1 in july 1983 luniewski left shamrock to join msi as vice-president in charge of operations ; 2 luniewski owns 50,000 shares of msi stock ; 3 msi was formed in 1982 to sterilize surgical instruments and manufacture other medical goods ; yet as soon as luniewski was hired in 1983 msi built facilities for processing ptfe with radiation ; 4 luniewski oversaw the design and construction of those facilities ; 5 luniewski was hired in part to start up msis infringing operations ; 6 the decision to begin processing ptfe with radiation was made jointly by luniewski and the president of msi ; 7 msi began manufacturing ptfe with radiation in 1985 ; and 8 luniewski was in charge of msis ptfe operation

msi attempts to distinguish diamond_scientific citing national_cash_register_co. v. remington_arms_co. 283_f._196 202 d.del.1922 affd 286_f._367_(3d_cir.1923) and babcock & wilcox co. v. toledo boiler works co. 170_f._81 85 6th cir.1909 for the proposition that there is no privity between a corporation and a mere_employee thereof
however as above indicated luniewski was far more than a mere_employee of msi and the undisputed_facts establish msis direct involvement of luniewski in msis infringing operations
msi clearly availed itself of luniewskis` knowledge and assistance' to conduct infringement
mellor 141 f. at 994
the district_court committed no error in finding msi in privity

2
alleged misrepresentations and duress
appellants say there were questions of fact on whether luniewski was misled on inventorship and patentability and signed the declaration under intimidation and duress
see diamond_scientific 848 f.2d at 1228 6 uspq2d at 2034 newman j. concurring assignor may still raise` usual_defenses to contract of assignment'
more specifically appellants argue that co-inventor neuberg made no contribution to the inventions that prior_work at high_voltage_engineering known to shamrock was a statutory bar and raised the possibility of inequitable_conduct and that luniewski feared losing his job and bonus if he did not sign the declarations

it suffices to say here that we agree with the district_courts determination that no genuine_issue of material_fact as to misrepresentation or duress exists
whether luniewski was misled on inventorship and patentability is a question relating to the viability of the patent_application not to the validity of the assignment agreement
hence it is not among the` usual_defenses to the contract of assignment'
as discussed more fully below the inequitable_conduct_defense is unfounded on its face
employment salary and bonuses are valid consideration for the assignment see id.at 1225 6 uspq2d at 2031 and to hold that fear of their loss constitutes duress or intimidation would undermine every assignment by an employee-inventor

3
inequitable conduct
appellants argue that diamond_scientific dealt with a challenge to patent validity but is silent on the equitable_defense of inequitable_conduct
we reject the contention that mere classification of a defense as equitable bars consideration of assignor_estoppel

it is at best incongruous to suppose that the equitable_doctrine of assignor_estoppel can never be applied to an equitable_defense
the premise of the doctrine prevention of unfairness and injustice is not removed upon the mere denomination of a defense as` equitable'
diamond_scientific 848 f.2d at 1224 6 uspq2d at 2031` courts that have expressed the estoppel doctrine in terms of unfairness and injustice have reasoned that an assignor should not be permitted to sell something and later to assert that what was sold is worthless *795 all to the detriment of the assignee`
if we were to hold otherwise diamond_scientific could be avoided by merely couching invalidity defenses in terms of inequitable_conduct precisely as appellants attempt here to do
see tenneco resins inc. v. reeves bros. inc. 736_f.2d_1508 1512 222_uspq_276 279 fed.cir.1984` while the affirmative_defenses of invalidity and unenforceability against an asserted patent are technically separate and distinct realistically they involve related if not identical evidence [ and are ]hopelessly intermingled with remaining issues
``

appellants say the spectre of inequitable_conduct is raised by its allegations that neuberg was misnamed as joint_inventor and that luniewski was misled about the prior_work at high_voltage_engineering and the patentability of the inventions
appellants rely on conjecture
moreover the district_court correctly determined that those allegations directly contradict statements made by luniewski in his declarations see e.g. diamond_scientific 848 f.2d at 1225 6 uspq2d at 2031-32 i.e
: 1 luniewskis declarations name neuberg as a joint_inventor ; 2 luniewski admitted participation in and knowledge of the prior_work at high_voltage_engineering in 1980 yet stated in his declaration that the invention was not` in public use or [ on ] sale in the united_states.. for more than one year prior to this application' ; and 3` luniewski participated in the patent_application process at least to the extent of reviewing and commenting on the disclosure portions of the application' and the declarations stated under penalty of perjury that the` apparatus and method for radiation processing of materials which is described and claimed in the attached specification' is the invention
where as here mere allegations made in support of an inequitable_conduct_defense are directly contradicted by the assignor-inventors statements made in his declaration they render the defense nonviable and the equitable_doctrine of assignor_estoppel bars its assertion

appellants also point to a statement in shamrocks board of patent appeals brief for the192_patent that` radiation penetrates for some distance into the mass of particles' when in fact` shallow depth of penetration is established by figure 6 of the patents-in-suit'
appellants fail however to explain how the statement and the showing in figure 6 could be shown to amount to withholding or concealment of material information with intent to deceive
see kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 872 9_uspq2d_1384 1389 fed.cir.1988 cert
denied 490_u.s._1067 109_s.ct._2068 104_l.ed.2d_633_(1989)
the allegations of inequitable_conduct based on the statement are as unfounded as those contradicted by luniewskis declarations and is equally incapable of avoiding the application of assignor_estoppel

appellants say that events relating to invalidity ordinarily occur before the inventor signs the declaration when he is in position to know and control them whereas acts constituting inequitable_conduct ordinarily occur after the inventor signs the declaration
that the basis for a defense arises after the inventor has signed a declaration however is ordinarily irrelevant the inventor having assigned the rights to his invention not alone to a patent_application
as we said in diamond_scientific 848 f.2d at 1226 6 uspq2d at 2032 it is also irrelevant that at the time of the assignment [ the inventors ] patent_applications were still pending and the patent office had not yet granted the patent
what [ the inventor ] assigned were the rights to his inventions
that diamond may have later amended the claims in the application process a very common occurrence in patent prosecutions with or without [ the inventors ] assistance does not give appellants argument against estoppel any greater force
our concern must be the balance of the equities
it is true that in a proper case general principles of equity may preclude use of assignor_estoppel to bar a viable equitable_defense arising from post-assignment events
see buckingham prods. 108 f.2d at 195 44 uspq at 95 inequitable_conduct may defeat invocation of assignor_estoppel *796 because` one may not profit from his own fraud' ; see also westinghouse elec
& mfg co. v. formica insulation co. 266_u.s._342 352-53 45_s.ct._117 120-21 69_l.ed._316_(1924) timing of assignment may affect scope of resulting estoppel
this is not such a case
of the events involved in the four allegations made here only the statement in the appeal brief occurred after luniewski signed the declarations and as above indicated that allegation of inequitable_conduct has no basis in law

conclusion
the district_courts grant of summary_judgment holding the005 and192_patent s not invalid enforceable and infringed and enjoining appellants from further_infringement is affirmed
