perseptive_biosystems inc.` perseptive' appeals the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of massachusetts holding perseptives united states patents nos._5019,270` the270_patent` 5,228,989` the989_patent` and 5,384,042` the042_patent` collectively` the patents' unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct before the united states patent and trademark_office` pto'
because the district_court correctly found that the named inventors of the patents made material_misrepresentations regarding inventorship with intent to deceive the pto during the prosecution of the patents we affirm the holding of inequitable_conduct

i
in 1993 perseptive sued pharmacia_biotech inc. pharmacia_biotech_as sepracor_inc. pharmacia_lbk_biotechnology_ab and biosepra inc. collectively` pharmacia' for patent infringement of the270 and989_patent s. in 1995 perseptive added a claim for infringement of the042_patent
all three patents which derived from a single patent_application are concerned with high-speed_chromatography or separation of biological materials of a type described by the patents as` perfusive' chromatography
the270_patent claims a method for practicing perfusive_chromatography the989_patent claims a particle used for perfusive_chromatography and the042_patent claims a matrix of particles used for perfusive_chromatography
all three patents list the same inventors dr. noubar afeyan professor_fred_regnier and dr. robert dean

in response to the perseptive allegations pharmacia raised among others the defenses that the patents were invalid for failure to name the correct inventors and that they were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct practiced by the named inventors during prosecution
in january 1996 the district_court ruled on cross-motions for summary judgment on the *1318 question of whether the patents were invalid for failure to list the correct_inventive_entity
see perseptive_biosystems inc. v. pharmacia_biotech inc. no._93-12237 slip op.at 32-33 d.mass
jan._9,_1996` perseptive i`
in that decision the district_court concluded that there was` undisputed clear and convincing_evidence' that the inventorship was incorrect but declined to hold the patents invalid
the district_court reasoned that pharmacia had not shown an absence of genuinely disputed facts regarding whether the named inventors had omitted the unnamed_inventors with deceptive_intent thereby precluding the correction of inventorship under the then-current understanding of 35 u.s.c.¡± 256 1994
see perseptive i slip op.at 31` [ t ] here remains a disputed issue of fact as to the named inventors state of mind preventing the court from ordering the correction of the patent without hearing`
accordingly the court invited perseptive to move under section 256 to correct the inventorship of the patents
see id

in march 1997 after a ten-day hearing the district_court denied perseptives motion to correct inventorship basing its conclusion on a pattern of false_statements and misrepresentations by the named inventors to the pto regarding the inventorship and timing of the invention
see perseptive_biosystems inc. v. pharmacia_biotech inc. no._93-12237 slip op.at 126 d.mass
mar._31,_1997` perseptive_ii`

soon after that ruling the federal_circuit decided stark v. advanced magnetics inc. 119_f.3d_1551 43_uspq2d_1321_(fed.cir.1997)
in stark this court held that section 256 authorizes correction of inventorship when there is no deceptive_intent on the part of the omitted inventors and does not require inquiry into the intent of the originally-named inventors
because this holding was contrary to the understanding of the district_court and the parties at the time of the perseptive_ii decision the district_court in january 1998 reconsidered perseptive_ii
see perseptive_biosystems inc. v. pharmacia_biotech inc. 12_f.supp.2d_69 70 d.mass.1998` perseptive_iii`

in perseptive_iii the district_court vacated its denial of perseptives section 256 motion concluding that no evidence had been introduced relating to the intent of the unnamed_inventors
see id. at 71
the court did however` reexamine the legal effect of its factual_findings in perseptive_ii that [ pharmacia had ] proven by clear and convincing_evidence that the named inventors made a series of misrepresentations to the [ pto ]'
id. at 71
adopting all the factual_findings of perseptive_ii the district_court concluded that the named inventors had committed inequitable_conduct when prosecuting the application that yielded the three patents
see id. at 73
accordingly the court held that the patents were unenforceable and entered final judgment under fed.r.civ.p

ii
inequitable conduct includes affirmative misrepresentations of a material fact failure to disclose material_information or submission of false material_information coupled with an intent to deceive
see molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178-79 33_uspq2d_1823 1826-27 fed.cir.1995
the defense of inequitable_conduct is entirely equitable in nature and thus not an issue for a jury to decide
see paragon podiatry lab inc. v. klm labs. inc. 984_f.2d_1182 1190 25_uspq2d_1561 1568 fed.cir.1993 ; gardco mfg. inc. v. herst lighting co. 820_f.2d_1209 1211-13 2_uspq2d_2015 2017-19 fed.cir.1987

determination of inequitable_conduct requires a two-step analysis
first the trial_court must determine whether the conduct meets a threshold_level of materiality
*1319 the trial_court must then also determine whether the evidence shows a threshold_level of intent to mislead the pto
see baxter int l inc. v. mcgaw inc. 149_f.3d_1321 1327 47_uspq2d_1225 1228-29 fed.cir.1998 ; halliburton co. v. schlumberger tech corp. 925_f.2d_1435 1439 17_uspq2d_1834 1838 fed.cir.1991
these threshold determinations are reviewed by this court under the clearly erroneous standard of federal rule of civil procedure 52 a
see kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 872 9_uspq2d_1384 1389 fed.cir.1988
once the threshold_levels of materiality and intent have been established the trial_court is required to weigh materiality and intent
see molins 48 f.3d at 1178 33 uspq2d at 1826-27
the more material the conduct the less evidence of intent will be required in order to find that inequitable_conduct has occurred
see n.v. akzo v. e.i
dupont de nemours 810_f.2d_1148 1153 1_uspq2d_1704 1708 fed.cir.1987
in light of all the circumstances the court must then determine whether the applicants conduct is so culpable that the patent should be held unenforceable
see labounty mfg. inc. v. united states int l trade comm n 958_f.2d_1066 1070 22_uspq2d_1025 1028 fed.cir.1992
we review the district_courts ultimate determination of inequitable_conduct under an abuse of discretion standard

a
the patent_application which led to the270989 and042_patent s was filed in july 1989 and listed only afeyan regnier and dean as inventors
see perseptive_ii slip op.at 69
in perseptive i the district_court after extensive factfinding and analysis determined that` undisputed clear and convincing_evidence' supported the conclusion that the named inventors were not the sole_inventors of the subject_matter of the three patents
perseptive i slip op.at 25
the district_court decided that frank warner and linda lloyd of polymer_laboratories ltd.` polymer_labs' a british company specializing in the area of chromatography and polymer analysis also should have been named as inventors
see id.at 29
the district_court also considered whether mary_ann_rounds regniers research_assistant at his purdue university laboratory should have been named as an inventor but concluded that this question was` a hotly disputed issue of fact'
id.at 21

there is no dispute now between the parties that warner lloyd and rounds-none of whom are named as inventors-worked in close collaboration with the named inventors in the development of the perfusive_chromatography techniques and materials that are the subject of the three perseptive patents
as the district_court noted it is undisputed that it was polymer_labs that supplied the materials and data that were critical to the named inventors understanding of the perfusive_chromatography_process
in fact it was the polymer_labs particles that were the genesis of the inventions-these particles exhibited beneficial chromatographic properties leading the named inventors to work together with warner lloyd and rounds to understand the cause of these properties.1 but while the district_court itself clearly believed that warner lloyd and perhaps rounds should have been named as inventors of the three patents at issue and theorized that the omission of inventors with deceptive_intent would be inequitable_conduct because it would involve` filing a false oath' perseptive_iii at 72 citing *1320 stark 119 f.3d at 1555 43 uspq2d at 1325 it noted that this conclusion was unnecessary for the purposes of its inequitable_conduct judgment
see perseptive_iii at 73` [ a ] good_faith_disagreement over the law of joint_inventorship does not provide the basis for this [ inequitable_conduct ] ruling`
instead the district_court found that the named inventors intentionally misrepresented to the pto the relationship between themselves and polymer_labs for the purpose of concealing the issue of inventorship i.e. whether warner lloyd and rounds perhaps should have been listed as inventors
in particular the district_court found by clear and convincing_evidence see perseptive_ii slip op.at 99 the following intentional_misrepresentations to the pto

[ 1 ] the named inventors falsely stated that regnier had` initiated' or` directed' the particle work at polymer_labs when in fact a named inventor dean in a contemporaneous writing flatly contradicted this assertion see id. slip op.at 99-101 ; [ 2 ] the named inventors falsely stated that they alone discovered that certain of the polymer_labs materials produced outstanding_separations when in fact lloyd and rounds discovered this characteristic see id. slip op.at 101 ; [ 3 ] at least one of the named inventors` intentionally did not disclose' the extensive_collaboration between his lab and polymer_labs personnel as supported by the contemporaneous documentation id. slip op.at 101-02 ; [ 4 ] the named inventors deliberately failed to disclose the extensive exchange of data` concerning pore_volume and structure' of the polymer_labs particles as evidenced by a named inventors deans contemporaneous memo stating that` i should think that [ polymer_labs & perseptive ] could get a patent on the structure of [ the particles ] re perfusion' id. slip op.at 102-03 ; [ 5 ] the named inventors misleadingly and falsely suggested that polymer_labs was only a source of raw_materials see id. slip op.at 104-05
the district_court concluded in perseptive_ii that these intentional_falsehoods misrepresentations and nondisclosures violated 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 which establishes the standard of truthful disclosure to the pto
see id. slip op.at 105
the district_court reaffirmed these findings upon reconsideration in perseptive_iii noting that they demonstrated` the persistent_course of material_misrepresentations omissions and half-truths to the pto that persuade me by clear and convincing_evidence of deceptive_intent on inventorship'
perseptive_iii at 73
on appeal perseptive does not directly challenge these findings of fact
instead perseptive argues that the district_court clearly erred in not finding that the totality of the disclosures to the pto` manifest objective good_faith' by the named inventors
appellants brief at 45
in particular perseptive notes that the named inventors disclosed the use of polymer_labs particles and that regnier had` informally consulted' with polymer_labs prior to the conception of the invention
these facts however were fully considered by the district_court see perseptive_ii slip op.at 74 and found to be supportive of a finding of intent to deceive the pto rather than indicative of good_faith
see id.at 105` [ t ] he information which suggested that polymer_labs was just asource ofraw_materials was misleading because it provided the patent_examiner with only a red_flag for the possible_issue of prior_art and obviousness-and obfuscated the threshold_issue of inventorship`
a review of the exhaustive record of deceptive_intent compiled by the district_court see perseptive_iii at 74 noting` extensive testimony and hundreds of documents reviewed' ; perseptive_ii slip op.at 1 noting the 10-day hearing when conducted through the lens of our standard of review simply does not leave one with` the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed'
*1321 united states v. united states gypsum co. 333_u.s._364 395 68_s.ct._525 92_l.ed._746_(1948) describing clear_error standard of review ; see also elk corp. of dallas v. gaf bldg
materials corp. 168_f.3d_28 31-32 49_uspq2d_1853 1857 fed.cir.1999 affirming factual_findings supporting inequitable_conduct ; key pharms
v. hercon labs corp. 161_f.3d_709 719 48_uspq2d_1911 1919 fed.cir.1998 finding no clear_error in an inequitable_conduct analysis because` the finding on intent in particular depended heavily on the presentation of evidence and witness testimony at trial
the trial_court was able to hear these matters first hand and assess witness credibility'
the district_courts finding of intent to deceive was not clear_error

b. perseptives primary argument on appeal is that the district_court erred in concluding in perseptive i that warner and lloyd should have been named as joint_inventors of the patents at issue in this case
see perseptive i slip op.at 29
from this premise perseptive asserts that` no predicate exists' for the district_courts perseptive_iii_judgment-that the patents are unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
appellants brief at 42
as noted above however this is a misreading of the perseptive_iii_judgment
the district_court specifically stated that the perseptive i conclusion-that inventorship of the patents was incorrect-was unnecessary to the inequitable_conduct decision
see perseptive_iii at 73` [ a ] good_faith_disagreement over the law of joint_inventorship does not provide the basis for this ruling`
instead the district_court noted that the perseptive_iii holding was based on the` persistent_course of material_misrepresentations omissions and half-truths to the pto' relating to inventorship
id

there can be no doubt that-irrespective of whether the district_court was correct in holding in perseptive i that the inventorship was incorrect-the intentional` misrepresentations omissions and half-truths to the pto' made as a` persistent_course' of conduct are highly material
as the court found these falsehoods and omissions were calculated to` obfuscate the threshold_issue of inventorship'
perseptive_ii slip op.at 105
as a critical requirement for obtaining a patent inventorship is material
see e.g. 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f 1994` a person shall be entitled to a patent unless.. he himself did not invent the subject_matter sought to be patented
`` ; 35 u.s.c.¡± 116` when an invention is made by two or more persons jointly they shall apply for a patent jointly`
examiners are required to reject applications under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f on the basis of improper_inventorship
see manual of patent_examining_procedure ¡± 2137.01 hereinafter` mpep'
accordingly the manual of patent_examining_procedure details the` rules' of inventorship to be used by examiners see id. and specifically notes that information about inventorship is material under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 see mpep_¡± 2001.06 c inventorship disputes are material_information ; mpep_¡± 2004 suggesting that applicants carefully consider inventorship in the duty to disclose context

furthermore the intentional_falsehoods and omissions found by the district_court easily meet our oft-stated test for materiality information is material if there` is asubstantial likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would consider it important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent
`` 2 *1322 baxter 149 f.3d at 1327 47 uspq2d at 1229 quoting 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 1989 ; see also j.p. stevens & co. v. lex tex ltd. 747_f.2d_1553 1559 223_uspq_1089 1092 fed.cir.1984
as we noted above an examiner must attend to the question of inventorship pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f
a full and accurate disclosure of the true nature of the relationship between perseptive and polymer_labs and the contributions of warner lloyd and rounds would have been` important' to a reasonable_examiners consideration of the inventorship question

perseptives argument that the patents claims were narrowed during prosecution thereby curing any possible inventorship problem misses the point
first whether the inventorship of the patents as issued is correct does not determine the materiality of the statements in this case just as whether concealed prior_art would actually invalidate the patent is irrelevant to materiality
see e.g. a.b
dick co. v. burroughs corp. 798_f.2d_1392 1397 230_uspq_849 853 fed.cir.1986` [ t ] he test for materiality is not whether there is anticipation or obviousness but rather what areasonable_examiner would consider.. important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent
`` emphasis omitted ; gardco 820 f.2d at 1214 2 uspq2d at 2019-20` the simple fact is that a patent may be valid and yet be rendered unenforceable for misuse or inequitable_conduct..
in determining the inequitable_conduct issue a district_court need not make explicit findings on whether undisclosed art anticipates the claimed invention or whether it would have rendered the claimed invention obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
``

second the materiality of intentional false_statements may be independent of the claims of the patent
see e.g. general electro music corp. v. samick music corp. 19_f.3d_1405 1411 30_uspq2d_1149 1154 fed.cir.1994 finding a false statement that the patentee had conducted a prior_art search to be material ; rohm & haas co. v. crystal chem co. 722_f.2d_1556 1571 220_uspq_289 300 fed.cir.1983` [ t ] here is no room to argue that submission of false affidavits is not material
`` ; see also 18 u.s.c.¡± 1001 1994 making intentionally false_statements to federal agencies punishable by fines and/or imprisonment of up to five years
accepting perseptives argument that the narrowing of the claims here renders immaterial the false_statements misdirects the focus of the inquiry the issue is not inventorship per se but misinformation about inventorship
the district_court found that the named inventors intentionally presented falsehoods and omissions to the pto on the subject of inventorship
there is no clear_error in the district_courts finding that these statements were material

c. our final question is whether the district_court abused its discretion in holding the patents unenforceable
see e.g. critikon 120_f.3d_1253 1255 43_uspq2d_1666 1668 stating that the ultimate conclusion of inequitable_conduct is reviewed for abuse of discretion
to recap the district_court found at least five specific instances of intentional_falsehoods misrepresentations and omissions to the pto
we have concluded that there is no clear_error in these findings
the district_court also found that these falsehoods misrepresentations and omissions were all directed towards a central issue-whether the named inventors were the sole_inventors-and that this issue inventorship was material
again there is no clear_error in these findings
given the absence of clear_error in the factual_findings on which the district_courts judgment stands we can not conclude that the district_court abused its *1323 discretion in determining that the behavior of the applicants constituted inequitable_conduct
accordingly we affirm the district_courts holding of inequitable_conduct

costs
no costs

affirmed

pauline newman circuit_judge dissenting
one would not know from the censorious tone of the majority opinion that the inventors were correctly named and that the origin of the patented inventions was fully disclosed to the patent_examiner

the named inventors did not claim to have invented the particles that were provided by polymer_laboratories
to the contrary these particles were reported in the patents as provided by` polymer_laboratories of shropshire england' as the subject of the experiments that led the named inventors to the claimed invention and as prior_art to the claimed invention
the polymer_laboratories_scientists as the district_court found did not know about the perfusive_behavior and the properties at very high_throughput or its structural basis until they were told about it
indeed the district_court recognized that the polymer_laboratories_scientists did not conceive the patented inventions and explicitly found that the scientists who the district_court found were` co-inventors' did not have a` definite and permanent_idea of the complete and operative_invention'

jan._9,_1996 perseptive i
the panel_majority does not find otherwise

the district_court in ruling that the patents are unenforceable for inequitable_conduct based on the naming of incorrect inventors explained that the omission of polymer_laboratories_scientists as` co-inventors' was` material as a matter of law'
the district_court stated in re-examining the record evidence as described in perseptive_ii under this equitable balancing test i conclude that the named inventors particularly professor_fred_regnier engaged in inequitable_conduct by omitting the names of warner and/or lloyd as co-inventors on the patent with deceptive_intent and that this omission is material as a matter of law
accordingly the patents are unenforceable
perseptive_biosystems inc. v. pharmacia_biotech inc. 12_f.supp.2d_69 73 d.mass.1998 perseptive_iii

however the inventors were not incorrectly named
although the panel_majority disclaims the relevance to inventorship of the invention that is claimed the disclosure to the examiner concerning the claimed invention is accurate and adequate and not grounds of inequitable_conduct.1

the claimed inventions
the three patents in suit derive from a common patent_application and contain the same_specification
the invention is the separation of biological_molecules by` perfusion' chromatography using a matrix of particles having a defined structure of through pores and solute interactive_surfaces whereby a fluid containing biological_molecules is passed through the matrix at a velocity that produces a higher rate of convective flow than diffusive_flow through the through pores measured as a peclet_number2 greater than 1.0
the method is broadly set forth in claim 1 of the270_patent

1
a chromatography method comprising the steps of *1324 a forming a chromatography_matrix by packing a multiplicity of particles defining throughpores and solute interactive_surface_regions therewithin ; and
( b passing a fluid mixture of solutes comprising biological_molecules through said matrix at a velocity sufficient to induce a convective fluid flow_rate through said throughpores greater than the rate of solute diffusion through said throughpores and to produce a peclet_number in said throughpores greater than 1.0
the divisional989_patent is directed to particles for perfusion_chromatography having a mean_diameter greater than 20£gm microns and pores of at least bimodal distribution the larger throughpores sized for convective_mass_transport and smaller_pores 300a-700a in diameter sized for diffusive_mass_transport
claim 1 of the989_patent follows 1
a particle defining a pore_structure at least
bimodal in its distribution that when packed produces a matrix suitable for perfusion_chromatography the particle comprising a rigid solid defining interactive_surface_regions having a mean_diameter greater than 20£gm and defining a plurality of throughpores sized for convective_mass_transport and a plurality of smaller_pores having diameters within the range of 300a-700a for diffusive_mass_transport to said interactive_surface_regions the ratio of the mean_diameter of the particle to the mean_diameter of the throughpores being less than 70
the divisional042_patent claims the perfusion_chromatography_matrix and includes the particle limitations of the989_patent
claim 1 follows 1
a chromatography_matrix comprising a plurality of packed particles the particles defining a pore_structure at least bimodal in its distribution that produces a matrix suitable for perfusion_chromatography the particles comprising a rigid solid having a mean_diameter greater than 20£gm and defining a plurality of throughpores for convective_mass_transport and a plurality of smaller_pores having diameters within the range of 300a-700a for diffusive_mass_transport and comprising solute interactive regions in fluid communication with the throughpores the ratio of the mean_diameter of the particle to the mean_diameter of the throughpores being less than 70
the district_court did not discuss the content of the claims
the panel_majority states that the claims are irrelevant to the issue of inequitable_conduct
however they are extremely relevant to inventorship and it is on inventorship that the ruling of inequitable_conduct was grounded
inventorship
`` inventorship' in the law of patents arises from conception not development or reduction to practice
as explained in burroughs_wellcome co. v. barr labs. inc. 40_f.3d_1223 1227-28 32_uspq2d_1915 1919 fed.cir.1994` [ c ] onception is the touchstone of inventorship the completion of the mental part of invention'
conception requires` an idea that was definite and permanent enough that one skilled in the art could understand the invention'
id.at 1228 32 uspq2d at 1919

`` inventorship is a question of who actually invented the subject_matter claimed in a patent' beech aircraft corp. v. edo corp. 990_f.2d_1237 1248 26_uspq2d_1572 1582 fed.cir.1993
the selection of the inventors depends on what is claimed
in burroughs_wellcome the court explained that for joint_invention` each inventor must contribute to the joint arrival at a definite and permanent_idea of the invention as it will be used in practice'
40 f.3d at 1229 32 uspq2d at 1921
although a patented invention may involve the work of more than one person and although each person need not make the same type or amount of contribution see *1325 35 u.s.c.¡± 116 each inventor must contribute to the conception of the claimed subject_matter
see burroughs_wellcome 40 f.3d at 1227-29 32 uspq2d at 1919-21 ; see also sewall v. walters 21_f.3d_411 417 30_uspq2d_1356 1360 fed.cir.1994 inventorship relates to the claimed subject_matter ; coleman v. dines 754_f.2d_353 359 224_uspq_857 862 fed.cir.1985 same

collaboration on a project with a common goal does not of itself produce joint_invention
conception requires a definite concept of the invention that is patented
the district_court found and it is not disputed that dr._warner of polymer_laboratories at first rejected the perfusion_concept and its basis in bimodal throughpore flow at high_throughput_velocity
this rejection can not be fairly viewed as a contribution by warner to the conception of the claimed invention which is limited to the perfusion_concept and its parameters
warners omission as a named inventor could not be a material_misrepresentation` as a matter of law'

the district_court described the history of the relationship between professor_regnier and dr._warner starting with the application of regniers coatings to improve the chromatographic_performance of polymer_laboratories particles
this was the background upon which the particles that led to the patents in suit were sent to professor_regnier along with the information that these particles exhibited good_chromatographic_properties
these particles were tested by mary_ann_rounds in professor_regniers laboratory
these tests confirmed the good_chromatographic_properties and were followed by tests at very high_flow_rates which produced performance that regnier described as` spectacular'
the results were reported back to polymer_laboratories
the record showed frequent_conversations among the scientists and the provision of additional samples by polymer_laboratories

professor_regnier and drs
afeyan and dean are the named inventors in the patents in suit
dr. afeyan is a biochemical engineer and dr._deans field is fluid mechanics
they undertook to study and understand the exceptional performance obtainable using some particles and the conditions of that performance
drs
afeyan and regnier obtained scanning electron_micrographs of the pore and surface structure of the polymer_laboratories_particles and dr._dean conducted fluid engineering studies
they applied various methods for measuring mass_transfer in a chromatographic matrix including dynamic capacity3 and plate height4 measurements

drs
regnier afeyan and dean found that certain particles contained throughpores as well as smaller_pores and interactive_surfaces
they determined the ratio of convective to diffusive_flow through the pore_structure
they concluded that there was a` perfusive' domain wherein the convective_velocity could be higher than the diffusive velocity when the flow_rate of the solutes through the matrix was sufficiently high
they determined the pore and flow characteristics that produced the exceptional chromatographic_performance obtained at high_throughput
it is undisputed that the polymer_laboratories_scientists did not initiate and did not conduct these studies or otherwise determine these characteristics
the district_court described the polymer_laboratories role as to` assist the program of research and experimentation'

there was no evidence or even argument that the discovery of the throughpore_structure *1326 and the convective/diffusive mechanism of perfusion was made by anyone other than the named inventors

the perseptive patent specifications refer to the collaboration between professor_regnier and polymer_laboratories and state that two types of particles produced by polymer_laboratories were` used by the inventors named herein in the initial_discoveries [ of the claimed inventions ]' [ one particle type having ] interactive_surfaces.. which interact with the hydrophobic patches on proteins [ and the second having ] interactive surface elements derivatized with polyethyleneimine and act as a cationic surface useful for anionic exchange
both types of particles were produced in an ongoing_effort initiated by f.e
regnier5 to increase intraparticle_diffusion of large_solutes such as proteins by increasing pore_size
these particles were used by the inventors named herein in the initial_discoveries of the perfusive_chromatography domain

'270_patent col. 17 line 58 to col. 18 line 3 ;989_patent col. 17 line 62 to col. 18 line 8 ;042_patent col. 17 line 66 to col. 18 line 11

polymer_laboratories had published scientific papers describing its particles and their chromatographic properties as determined by the polymer_laboratories_scientists
various of these publications were included in the disclosure statements filed in the pto
during patent prosecution the examiner contacted polymer_laboratories to obtain additional information
the examiner initially rejected the claims citing polymer_laboratories publications and other references
in response perseptive further explained that its discovery was that` certain of the [ polymer_laboratories ] supplied materials produced outstanding_separations at extraordinarily high_flow_rates'
perseptive explained its discovery as follows the inventors thereafter experimented with various [ polymer_laboratories ] supplied materials in various ways including scanning electron microscopy to determine the structure responsible for the properties to understand how such properties could occur and to determine how they could be reproduced reliably
applicants discovered that these materials defined throughpores
'270_patent_application amendment c emphases in original
perseptive stated to the examiner that 8£gm and 10£gm 1000a polymer_laboratories_particles were available more than one year before the perseptive filing date and that these products` can be made to perfuse as applicants have disclosed'
the patent specifications state that pl produced and subsequently marketed two` macroporous' chromatography media comprising particles having an average diameter of 8£gm to 10£gm and a particle-mean pore diameter of 1000a and 4000a
'270_patent col. 17 lines 44-48
during prosecution perseptive argued patentability over the polymer_laboratories and other prior_art stating that` [ t ] here simply is no suggestion in the art to run specific types of materials having an appropriate ratio of particle size to throughpore_size at high_flow_rates'
the district_court agreed that the mechanism of perfusive_behavior was discovered by the named inventors using the particles received from polymer_laboratories
the court expressly found that` the named inventors seem to be the first to have recognized that the existence and size of the throughpore in the polymer_laboratories packing particle had an effect on the separation of liquids under high pressure'
perseptive i slip op.at 24

no polymer_laboratories_scientist was asserted in these proceedings to have discovered *1327 the structure and conditions necessary for perfusion
all the claims as originally filed and as issued contained limitations relating to perfusion
having discovered the throughpores and the dimensions of the pore_structure and the ensuing perfusive criteria it was reasonable for the named inventors to believe that they were the correct_inventive_entity for claims limited by these parameters
the district_court expressly found that the throughpore information was generated by the named inventors and communicated by them to polymer_laboratories and in perseptive i appeared to apply the correct law of inventorship prior to the throughpore discovery polymer_labs did not have a` definite and permanent_idea of the complete and operative_invention as it is hereafter to be applied in practice'
hybritech inc. v. monoclonal antibodies inc. 802_f.2d_1367 1376 fed.cir.1986
perseptive reported to the patent office that only some of the experimental batches of pl-sax widepore materials exhibited unusual behavior
the named inventors also testified there were inconsistent test results on the samples
without understanding the significance of the throughpore and its dimensions polymer_labs did not have a basis for controlling for this feature
perseptive i slip op.at 28-29

these findings support perseptives position that even on the district_courts view that inventorship was incorrectly designated it was not inequitable_conduct to have made a selection that omitted persons who did not participate in the discoveries that constituted the claimed inventions
see pro-mold and tool co. v. great lakes plastics inc. 75_f.3d_1568 1576 37_uspq2d_1626 1632-1633 fed.cir.1996` an error in determining inventorship is not by itself inequitable_conduct'
also applicable is the ruling in pro-mold that` [ w ] hen an alleged omitted co-inventor does not claim to be such it can hardly be inequitable_conduct not to identify that person to the pto as an inventor'
id

the panel_majority holds quoting the district_court that` a good_faith_disagreement' on inventorship is not` the basis for this [ inequitable_conduct ] ruling'
perseptive_iii 12 f.supp.2d at 73
however the court can not ignore the correct inventorship for when inventorship is correctly viewed as directed to that which is claimed the information that the district_court held should have been disclosed to the examiner is not material

the panel_majority says that perseptive` does not directly challenge' the district_courts findings of material_misrepresentation and deceptive_intent
maj. op.at 1320
that is incorrect
the entire appeal is from these findings
although the district_court ruled that the omission of the additional co-inventors was` material as a matter of law' and that this was the basis of the courts decision the district_court also described various statements as material` omissions and misrepresentations' upon which the panel_majority now relies

it was undisputed that the named inventors discovered the claimed subject_matter
no` omission or misrepresentation' was shown to be material to the inventorship of this subject_matter
the district_court having stated that it was not relying on any misrepresentations rejected perseptives proffer of expert_testimony on the issue of materiality
the court explained this expert_testimony might have been helpful if the court were relying on the misrepresentations as the basis of [ the ] inequitable_conduct claim
however the basis of my conclusion that there was inequitable_conduct is my finding of a deliberate omission of a true inventor
this omission is material as a matter of law
i conclude that expert_testimony would not be helpful on the issue of materiality on the joint_inventorship issue
perseptive_iii 12 f.supp.2d at 74
thus the district_court rejected perseptives attempt to contest materiality
the record before us does not contain the details of the proffered expert_testimony but` the *1328 patentee can not be deprived of the right to rebut an inequitable_conduct charge by showing lack of materiality..' allied colloids inc. v. american cyanamid co. 64_f.3d_1570 1578 35_uspq2d_1840 1845 fed.cir.1995

the panel_majority also states that it is` undisputed' that polymer_laboratories provided` the materials and data that were critical to the named inventors understanding of the perfusive_chromatography_process'
slip op.at 1319
that is incorrect and is vigorously disputed
what was` critical' to the named inventors understanding were the electron_micrographs the plate measurements the pore_size determinations the discovery of the throughpores and the bimodal structure and the relation between convective and diffusive transport all of which were determined by the named inventors
if the panel_majority is simply saying that polymer_laboratories provided the` materials' the particles that was never disputed and was disclosed to the pto
but the particles did not provide the` understanding of the perfusive_chromatography_process' as the panel_majority proposes
that understanding came from the investigations done by the named inventors

the patents all state that the polymer_laboratories_particles were used in making the claimed inventions and the relationship was explained to the examiner
that should have resolved the issue of inequitable_conduct for neither material withholding nor deceptive_intent was shown by clear and convincing_evidence
my colleagues however insist that there was more to tell the examiner and enumerate five aspects that the panel_majority states should have been disclosed to the examiner

no
[ 1 ]
the first of the five fatal flaws identified by my colleagues is the subject of footnote 5 supra and derives from the statement in the patent specification that two types of polymer_laboratories` particles were produced in an ongoing_effort initiated by f.e
regnier to increase intraparticle_diffusion of large_solutes such as proteins by increasing pore_size'
'270_patent col. 17 lines 65-68
the district_court found that this statement was untrue and a misrepresentation
perseptive states it is true and not a misrepresentation

i must point out that the panel_majority inaccurately reports the district_courts finding
the district_court did not find that the named inventors falsely stated that regnier` initiated or directed' quoting the panel_majority the particle production
as the district_court observed an earlier draft had used the word` directed' but the patent_application as filed replaced it with` initiated' for dr._dean had commented that` i was not aware that freddirected polymer_laboratoriess particle fabrication effort'
( emphasis by dean
it was undisputed that fred regnier was not concerned with` particle fabrication' but with` diffusion of large_solutes' such as proteins
the district_court viewed the change from` directed' to` initiated' as` cosmetic' and not changing the` thrust of the misrepresentation'
there are however obvious differences between initiating and directing
further there was no evidence of falsity of the statement in the patent

as to the initiation of the collaboration the district_court found the following facts well before the events now at issue ms. rounds dr. regniers research_assistant contacted polymer_laboratories inquiring about the availability of chromatographic packing material
dr._warner responded that polymer_laboratories` would be pleased to collaborate with [ rounds ] and professor f. regnier by supplying' such material
rounds and regnier told dr._warner that it was their objective` to make ion-exchange chromatographic media for biomolecules'
the district_court found that` rounds hoped to evaluate the materials for use in the chromatography of large materials' and to evaluate the performance of an interactive surface chemical coating known as sax which had been patented by regnier for chromatographic particles
regnier and rounds applied *1329 the sax coating to the 300_and_1000 media from polymer_laboratories found that it produced superior chromatographic properties and sent the results to polymer_laboratories
ms._lloyd of polymer_laboratories later applied regniers coating to make the pl-sax 4000 particles
these findings all support the usage of` initiated' in the patents statement of the background of the collaboration and negate the panel_majoritys conclusion of a material_misrepresentation based on this use of` initiated'

because the district_court explicitly found that no polymer_laboratories_scientist had a` definite and permanent_idea' of the claimed invention whoever` initiated' the collaboration is irrelevant
this aspect can not support the courts ruling of inequitable_conduct based on incorrect inventorship

no
[ 2 ]
the district_court found that the named inventors misstated that they discovered that certain of the polymer_laboratories materials produced outstanding_separations at extraordinarily high_flow_rates
according to the district_court this discovery was made by rounds` working under regniers supervision' and by lloyd of polymer_laboratories
the panel_majority concludes that this was a material_misrepresentation and was made with intent to deceive the pto

it is not disputed that rounds working under regniers direction at purdue tested the sample received from lloyd in accordance with regniers standard protocol at what the district_court called` high_flow_rates' of 1ml/min and 2ml/min
rounds observed` really good' chromatographic_separation
at regniers instruction rounds ran the separations at very high_flow_rates up to 4ml/min and reported the results to regnier who concluded that the material was` spectacular'
the district_court did not attribute any of these observations to anyone from polymer_laboratories and did not decide whether rounds should have been named a co-inventor
there was neither evidence nor findings that ms._lloyd or anyone else from polymer_laboratories participated in these tests or in the observation of spectacular performance at very high_throughput_velocity

the pto record shows various polymer_laboratories publications by lloyd and others reporting the chromatographic behavior that was found by polymer_laboratories
some of this work was cited as prior_art by the examiner
the panel_majoritys ruling that the work done by lloyd and rounds should have been submitted to the patent_examiner is unsupported by any finding related to the substance of the claims and can not constitute a material_misrepresentation or omission with deceptive_intent

no
[ 3 ]
the district_court found that regnier` intentionally did not disclose the extensive_collaboration between rounds and lloyd to the pto'
the record shows that rounds and lloyd were indeed in frequent communication and could be deemed to collaborate
the panel_majoritys requirement that collaborative relationships must be reported to the pto whether or not any collaborator is an inventor of what is claimed is as incorrect as it is unworkable
this ruling will outdistance any earlier` plague' of attacks on patents

no
[ 4 ]
the panel_majoritys fourth enumerated wrong is the district_courts finding that it was a material_omission or misrepresentation that the named inventors did not disclose to the pto that they` exchanged data' with polymer_laboratories regarding pore_volume and structure
there were indeed frequent_conversations among the scientists
however` exchange of data' is a loose term for so serious a consequence as loss of the patent
there is no finding and indeed no allegation that polymer_laboratories_scientists discovered the pore_volume and structure
the ensuing exchanges of data did not convert the polymer_laboratories_scientists into joint_inventors
there is no basis whatsoever for suggesting that such technical exchanges *1330 must be reported to the patent_examiner for review of inventorship

the panel_majority reports dr._deans statement about the possibility of` joint_inventorship' as evidence of bad intent by regnier
however dr._deans expression of a legal opinion before any patent_application was filed or the claims defined does not establish inequitable_conduct based on the exchanges of information among these scientists

no
[ 5 ]
the panel_majority also relies on what it describes as a district_court finding that the named inventors misleadingly and falsely suggested that polymer_laboratories was only a source of raw_materials
the district_court indeed called this statement` misleading' although not` false' the district_court expressing the view that more should have been said` because it provided the patent_examiner with only a red_flag for the possible_issue of prior_art and obviousness-and obfuscated the threshold_issue of inventorship'
perseptive_ii slip op.at 105-06
the district_court referred to the statement in the specifications that polymer_laboratories was a` source of particles suitable for the practice for perfusion_chromatography'
it is undisputed that polymer_laboratories was such a source
the statement is not false and can not be viewed as misleading in view of the disclosures made in the specification and during prosecution
surely this true statement is not clear and convincing_evidence of inequitable_conduct
there is no indication that more information was needed or appropriate
the record makes clear that the claimed invention was made by the regnier team using the particles provided by polymer_laboratories ; no further disclosure was necessary

the five acts with which the panel_majority impeaches the named inventors are overstated if not irrelevant
by no stretch do they represent clear and convincing_evidence of material_omission or misrepresentation with intent to deceive the examiner as to inventorship

the erroneous ruling on 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f the panel_majority states that` [ e ] xaminers are required to reject applications under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f on the basis of improper_inventorship' citing ¡± 2137.01 of the manual of patent_examining_procedure
this section of the mpep states that examiners may make a rejection under ¡± 102 f in specified circumstances not here applicable
the relevant portion of mpep_¡± 2137.01 follows if a determination is made that the inventive entity named in a u.s. application is not correct such as when a petition under 37_c.f.r._148 a is not granted or is not entered for technical reasons but the admission therein regarding the error in inventorship is uncontroverted a rejection under 35_u.s.c._102 f should be made

.
the party or parties executing an oath or declaration under 37_c.f.r._163 are presumed to be the inventors
mpep_¡± 2137.01 7th_ed
1998
section 102 f is also mentioned in mpep_¡± 605.07 as follows under 35_u.s.c._116 an examiner may reject claims under 35_u.s.c._102 f only in circumstances where a named inventor is not the inventor of at least one claim in the application ; no rejection under 35_u.s.c._102 f is appropriate if a named inventor made a contribution to the invention defined in any claim of the application
mpep_¡± 605.07 7th_ed
1998
pursuant to pto procedures the examiner could not have made a rejection under ¡± 102 f

the panel_majority also refers to mpep_¡± 2001.06 c and mpep_¡± 2004
mpep_¡± 2001.06 c entitled` information from related litigation' requires the applicant to disclose material_information arising from a related litigation and relating to the subject_matter of a pending patent_application including questions of inventorship
it is undisputed that perseptive *1331 complied with mpep_¡± 2001.06 c
perseptive submitted the entire perseptive i opinion and sixteen related litigation documents
they were received by the same examiner who had examined the three patents in suit and who was then examining a divisional application of the042_patent on the same_specification
upon reviewing these submissions the examiner stated that` the inventorship of the instant application would appear to be correct'

mpep_¡± 2004 states that in connection with the duty of disclosure` [ i ] t is desirable to ask questions about inventorship' and that` if there are questions call them to the attention of the patent and trademark_office'
it is apparent that perseptives attorney did so for the specification describes the genesis of the invention

none of these practices requires any behavior beyond what was done or provides support for the ruling of inequitable_conduct

summary
there has been no showing that the named inventors acted with intent to deceive or that they withheld material_information that they should have disclosed to the examiner
see allied colloids 64 f.3d at 1578 35 uspq2d at 1846` it is not inequitable_conduct to omit telling the patent_examiner information that the applicant in good_faith believes is not material to patentability'
the panel_majority finds inequitable_conduct in inventorship while ruling irrelevant the claimed invention and the correct inventorship.6 the court thus ignores or trivializes the role of claims to define the invention and imposes an irrational and unsupported ruling that denies the law of inventorship
the premises as well as the conclusion of the panel_majority are seriously flawed
i must respectfully dissent

eventually however the relationship ended the district_court found that after the named inventors surprised polymer_labs by filing for a patent on the properties exhibited by the polymer_labs particles contradicting earlier assurances that such a patent would not be sought perseptive announced to polymer_labs that it would file suit if polymer_labs sold their particles to anyone but perseptive
