opinion
bryson circuit_judge
apotex_corp. apotex inc. and torpharm inc. collectively` apotex' and impax_laboratories inc. appeal judgments entered against them by the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york
apotex and impax were defendants in a multidistrict litigation initiated by plaintiffs astrazeneca ab aktiebolaget_hassle kbi-e inc. kbi inc. and astrazeneca_lp collectively` astra' against a number of generic drug manufacturers for infringement of astras patents covering formulations of omeprazole the active_ingredient in prilosec a drug designed to treat acid-related gastrointestinal_disorders
the district_court divided the defendants into two separate` waves' for purposes of trial
for each wave the district_court held a consolidated_bench_trial

we decided appeals from the` first wave' litigation in in re omeprazole patent *1365 litigation 84_fed.appx._76_(fed.cir.2003) and in re omeprazole_patent_litigation 483_f.3d_1364_(fed.cir.2007)
the present appeals arise from the` second wave' litigation
in the second wave cases the district_court entered judgment of noninfringement with respect to mylan laboratories inc. and judgments of infringement against apotex and impax
astra appealed the judgment of noninfringement in the mylan case and we recently affirmed that judgment in in re omeprazole_patent_litigation 2008_wl_2369864_(fed.cir._june_10,_2008)
in this consolidated appeal apotex and impax challenge the district_courts judgments of infringement against each of them
because we find no error in the district_courts decision we affirm

i
the patents involved in this appeal are u.s._patent_no._4786,505` the ¡¬ 505 patent' and u.s._patent_no._4853,230` the ¡¬230_patent`
the two patents relate to pharmaceutical preparations containing omeprazole the active_ingredient in prilosec
omeprazole is a potent inhibitor of gastric_acid_secretion but it is susceptible to degradation in acid-reacting and neutral media
its stability is also affected by moisture and organic solvents
to protect omeprazole from gastric acid in the stomach a pharmaceutical_dosage can include an enteric_coating that covers the drug_core
enteric coatings however contain acidic compounds which can cause the omeprazole in the drug_core to decompose while the dosage is in storage resulting in discoloration and decreasing omeprazole content in the dosage over time
to increase the storage_stability of a pharmaceutical_dosage alkaline_reacting_compounds` arcs' may be added to the drug_core
the addition of an arc however can compromise the enteric_coating
a conventional enteric_coating allows for some diffusion of water from gastric juices into the drug_core but water entering the drug_core will dissolve the arcs which can in turn cause the enteric_coating to dissolve
¡¬505_patent col. 1 line 33 to col. 2 line 4

the inventors of the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent s solved that problem by adding an inert_subcoating that rapidly disintegrates in water
the subcoating increases storage_stability and provides sufficient gastric_acid_resistance to prevent omeprazole from degrading in the stomach
once the dosage reaches the small_intestine the solubility of the subcoating allows for rapid release of the omeprazole in the drug_core
¡¬505_patent col._5,_ll._19-68

the ¡¬505_patent covers a pharmaceutical preparation containing omeprazole
claim 1 recites an oral pharmaceutical preparation comprising
( a a core_region comprising an effective_amount of a material selected from the group consisting of omeprazole plus an alkaline_reacting_compound an alkaline_omeprazole_salt plus an alkaline_reacting_compound and an alkaline_omeprazole_salt alone ; b an inert_subcoating which is soluble or rapidly disintegrating in water disposed on said core_region said subcoating comprising one or more_layers of materials selected from among tablet_excipients and polymeric film-forming compounds ; and
( c an outer layer disposed on said subcoating comprising an enteric_coating

the ¡¬230_patent more broadly covers a preparation containing an` acid-labile pharmaceutically active_substance'
claim 1 of the ¡¬230_patent recites a pharmaceutical preparation comprising a an alkaline_reacting core comprising an acid-labile pharmaceutically active *1366 substance and an alkaline_reacting_compound different from said active_substance an alkaline_salt of an acid_labile pharmaceutically active_substance or an alkaline_salt of an acid_labile pharmaceutically active_substance and an alkaline_reacting_compound different from said active_substance ; b an inert_subcoating which rapidly dissolves or disintegrates in water disposed on said core_region said subcoating comprising one or more_layers comprising materials selected from the group consisting of tablet_excipients film-forming compounds and alkaline_compounds ; and
( c an enteric_coating_layer surrounding said subcoating_layer wherein the subcoating_layer isolates the alkaline_reacting core from the enteric_coating_layer such that the stability of the preparation is enhanced

ii
on december 31 1999 impax sought approval from the food and drug_administration` fda' to sell 10- and 20-mg generic versions of prilosec
in response astra filed suit for infringement of the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent s under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a
astra filed a second action against impax after impax amended its application to include a 40-mg product
in september 2004 the fda granted impax final approval to market its 10- and 20-mg omeprazole products
impax began marketing its approved products which prompted astra to amend its complaint to include claims for damages under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 a - c
impax filed an answer to astras second amended complaint in which it asserted counterclaims for fraud and sham litigation for a declaration of unenforceability as to the two patents and for declarations of noninfringement and invalidity as to all the claims of both patents
impax demanded a jury_trial for all of its counterclaims and for astras claims of infringement

at that time astras claims for damages and willful infringement had been severed and stayed pending the resolution of the liability issues in the case
astra and impax had also agreed in 2003 to sever and stay impaxs antitrust_counterclaims
at a hearing on december 1 2005 astra asked the court to sever its claims of infringement under section 271 a - c from its claims under section 271 e for which it did not seek damages so that the district_court could consolidate its claims against impax under section 271 e in a bench_trial with the other_defendants
the district_court requested briefing on whether impax was entitled to a jury_trial
in response astra stipulated that it would agree to dismiss its demand for damages against impax with prejudice if the district_court heard its claims against impax in the consolidated_bench_trial
based on that stipulation the court denied impaxs demand for a jury_trial and consolidated the section 271 e claims against impax with the claims against the other_defendants

the district_court then held a 42-day bench_trial
following the trial and before the court issued its decision the patents both expired
impax filed a motion to dismiss astras claims against it as moot because astra had dismissed its claims for damages against impax
the district_court denied that motion however because the fda had granted astra a six-month_period of market_exclusivity following the expiration of the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent_s. on may_31,_2007 the district_court issued its decision holding that astras patents were valid enforceable and infringed by impax
the court therefore set the effective_date of impaxs anda to october 20 2007 the end of astras six-month_period of market_exclusivity

*1367 on appeal impax argues that the district_court erred in denying its demand for a jury_trial and in denying its motion to dismiss astras claims as moot
it also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence of infringement and it further claims that the district_court committed clear_error by not finding the claims of the two patents invalid under the public-use_bar of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b

a
we first address impaxs argument that the district_court lost jurisdiction over the case after the patents expired on april_20,_2007
impax argues that on that date the case became moot because astra having already dismissed its claims for damages had no remaining claim for any possible relief to which it might be legally entitled
the district_court rejected that argument because the fda had granted astra an additional six-month_period of market_exclusivity after astra had agreed to the fdas request that it perform pediatric testing of its product
the court held that it had the authority to enforce astras right to market_exclusivity under the authority of section 271 e 4 a and under its general equitable authority
we reject impaxs argument as to the district_courts jurisdiction because we believe the district_court correctly interpreted section 271 e 4 a to provide a post-expiration remedy for infringement under section 271 e 2

section 271 e 2 a makes it an act of infringement to file` an application under section 505 j of the federal_food drug and cosmetic_act or described in section 505 b 2 of such act for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent'
an application filed under section 505 j of the federal_food drug and cosmetic_act codified at 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j is known as an abbreviated new drug application` anda'
an anda must contain one of four certifications regarding each patent that covers the applications drug i that such_patent information has not been filed ii that such_patent has expired iii of the date on which such_patent will expire or
( iv that such_patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii
if the applicant provides a paragraph_iv_certification the patent_holder may file suit under section 271 e 2 a
if the patent_holder files suit within 45 days the fda is barred from approving the anda for 30_months._21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 5 b iii
the fda may approve the anda after that period or earlier if the applicant succeeds in showing non-infringement of the patent or in proving the patents invalidity
id.¡± 355 j 5 b iii i

if the patent_holder proves infringement of a valid patent resulting from the filing of an anda section 271 e 4 provides three remedies
subparagraphs b and c provide the typical remedies for infringement injunctive_relief and damages
subparagraph a however provides an additional type of relief after a finding of infringement under section 271 e 2 by requiring the district_court to` order the effective_date of any approval of the drug or veterinary biological product involved in the infringement to be a date which is not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed'
if the fda has not approved the anda before the district_court determines that the patent has been infringed the fda may not approve the anda until the effective_date specified by the district_court under section 271 e 4 a
see 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 5 b iii ii bb
if the fda has already approved the anda the district *1368 courts order would alter the effective_date of the application thereby converting a final approval into a tentative approval
see ortho-mcneil pharm. inc. v. mylan labs. inc. 520_f.3d_1358 1366 fed.cir.2008 ; mylan labs. inc. v. thompson 389_f.3d_1272 1281-82 d.c.cir.2004 ; see also s.rep
no._98-547 at 46 1984 as reprinted in 1984_u.s.c.c.a.n._2647 2679` in the case where an anda had been approved the order would mandate a change in the effective_date
``

in most circumstances the effective_date in a district_courts order under section 271 e 4 a will be the date of patent_expiration including any patent_extensions
in this case however astra was entitled to an additional six-month_period of market_exclusivity sometimes known as a period of` pediatric exclusivity' under the food and drug_administration modernization act of 1997 pub.l
no._105-115 111_stat._2296
a provision of that act codified at 21 u.s.c.¡±_355a authorizes the food and drug_administration to make a written request to the holder of an approved new drug application` nda' for the holder to perform pediatric_studies
if the nda holder agrees to the request and performs the pediatric_studies the period during which the fda is barred from approving an anda filed by competing drug manufacturers is extended by six months
see 21 u.s.c.¡±_355a b - c
section 355a specifically addresses situations in which a paragraph_iv_certification is submitted
in those cases the period during which an anda may not be approved under section 355 j 5 b` shall be extended by a period of six months [ i.e. the period of pediatric or market_exclusivity ] after the date the patent expires including any patent_extensions'
id.¡±¡± 355a b 2 b 355a c 2 b

impax does not argue that the district_court was altogether foreclosed from enforcing astras period of market_exclusivity
rather impax argues that astras claim of infringement became moot once the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent s expired and therefore the district_court lacked authority to order a change in the effective_date of impaxs anda
we reject that argument
for a claim to be justiciable` [ i ] t must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts'
aetna life ins co. v. haworth 300_u.s._227 240-41 57_s.ct._461 81_l.ed._617_(1937)
impax does not dispute that if the district_court had issued its decision before the patents expired section 271 e 4 a would have authorized the district_court to order the effective_date of impaxs anda to be october 20 2007 the date on which astras period of market_exclusivity expired
impax argues that once the patents expired section 271 e 4 a no longer provided a remedy because the patents expiration rendered the claim of infringement moot
that argument simply assumes its conclusion ; impax offers no reason to suggest that section 271 e 4 a provides no remedy after patent_expiration other than to assert that no remedy is available after patent_expiration

in support of its position that the district_court may not grant relief relating to the period of market_exclusivity after a patent has expired impax relies on two district_court cases pfizer inc. v. mylan labs. inc. 2006_wl_2990398_(w.d.pa._oct.18,_2006) and roche palo alto llc v. apotex inc. 526_f.supp.2d_985_(n.d.cal.2007)
neither of those cases provides persuasive support for impaxs position
the pfizer_court relied on our decision in kearns v. chrysler corp. 32_f.3d_1541 1549-51 fed.cir.1994 in which we held that a district_court did not abuse its discretion *1369 in denying injunctive_relief after the patent in suit had expired
kearns however addressed the availability of relief under 35 u.s.c.¡± 283 ; it did not address the availability of relief under section 271 e 4 a
the pfizer_courts reliance on kearns was therefore misplaced
in roche the court addressed the proper language to be used in an order entered under section 271 e 4 a
instead of ordering the effective_date of the defendants anda to be set to the date on which the six-month exclusivity period would end the court adopted the language of the statute ordering the effective_date to be` not earlier than the date of the expiration of the patent which has been infringed'
526 f.supp.2d at 1000
here impax has not challenged the particular terms of the district_courts order ; it has challenged the availability of any relief at all under section 271 e 4 a1

b
on the issue of infringement impax challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that its formulation infringes the claims of the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent_s. impax argues that the record does not support either the district_courts finding that impaxs formulation contains an` effective_amount' of omeprazole and an arc or its finding that the formulation has an inert_subcoating
we reject both arguments

limitation a of claim 1 of the ¡¬505_patent requires a core_region comprising an effective_amount of a material selected from the group consisting of omeprazole plus an alkaline_reacting_compound an alkaline_omeprazole_salt plus an alkaline_reacting_compound and an alkaline_omeprazole_salt alone
in the first_wave_trial in this case the district_court construed` effective_amount' to apply to both the amount of omeprazole and the amount of an arc present in the core
the court construed` alkaline_reacting_compound' as
( 1 a pharmaceutically acceptable alkaline or basic substance having a ph greater than 7 that 2 stabilizes the omeprazole or other_acid_labile_compound by 3 reacting to create a micro-ph of not less than 7 around the particles of omeprazole or other_acid_labile_compound
impax argues that astras evidence satisfies only the first and third of those three requirements because astra did not introduce evidence of comparative stability testing to prove the second
impax maintains that without stability testing astras evidence was deficient in two respects

first impax argues that astra should have been required to show that impaxs formulation is stable without the use of a desiccant
that argument is without merit
as the district_court observed the claims at issue do not require that omeprazole be stabilized without the use of a desiccant
in fact the patents teach the use of a desiccant as a preferred additional means of stabilizing the claimed product
the description of the final dosage form states it is essential for the long term_stability during storage that the water_content of the final dosage form containing omeprazole enteric coated tablets capsules or pellets is kept low preferably not more than 1.5 % by weight
as a consequence the final package containing hard gelatin capsules filled with enteric_coated_pellets preferably also contain a desiccant which reduces the water_content *1370 of the gelatin shell to a level where the water_content of the enteric_coated_pellets filled in the capsules does not exceed 1.5 % by weight
¡¬505_patent col. 5 line 63 to col. 6 line 5 emphasis added

second impax asserts that astras evidence does not assess the individual contribution of the arc to the stability of omeprazole in the drug_core
even so the district_court did not err in concluding that astras evidence was sufficient to demonstrate the stability of omeprazole
based on its construction of the claim term` alkaline_reacting_compound' the district_court found that astra proved that limitation to be met by showing that a basic_compound created a` micro-ph' in the drug_core of not less than 7
impax argues that in doing so the district_court strayed from the construction it had applied in the first_wave_litigation

we reject impaxs argument
in the first_wave_litigation the district_court described the evidentiary requirement for the stabilization prong of its construction of` alkaline_reacting_compound' by stating that` [ a ] s the specification discloses that stabilization is achieved by using an arc in the core to create a micro-ph around the omeprazole particles of not less than ph 7'
astra aktiebolag v. andrx pharms. inc. 222_f.supp.2d_423 464 s.d.n.y.2002
that is the same evidentiary burden that the district_court placed on astra in this case and we agree with the district_court that the specification supports that interpretation of` alkaline_reacting_compound'
indeed the description of the drug_core states omeprazole is mixed with inert preferably water soluble conventional pharmaceutical constituents to obtain the preferred concentration of omeprazole in the final mixture and with an alkaline_reacting otherwise inert pharmaceutically acceptable substance or substances which creates a` micro-ph' around each omeprazole particle of not less than ph=7 preferably not less than ph=8 when water is adsorbed to the particles of the mixture or when water is added in small amounts to the mixture
¡¬505_patent col._3,_ll._38-47
we therefore find no clear_error in the district_courts conclusion that astras ph data proved the presence of an` effective_amount' of an arc in impaxs anda formulation

impax presents similar arguments with respect to the` enhanced stability' requirement of the ¡¬230_patent
limitation c of claim 1 of the ¡¬230_patent requires
an enteric_coating_layer surrounding said subcoating_layer wherein the subcoating_layer isolates the alkaline_reacting core from the enteric_coating_layer such that the stability of the preparation is enhanced
the district_court however correctly concluded that enhanced stability is the intended result of using an inert_subcoating around a drug_core containing an amount of an arc in the drug_core sufficient to create a micro-ph of not less than 7
see syntex u.s.a. llc v. apotex inc. 407_f.3d_1371 1378 fed.cir.2005` the termin a stabilizing amount simply describes the intended result of using the weight to volume ratios recited in the claims`
contrary to impaxs assertion the requirement of` enhanced stability' was not` read out of the claims entirely'
rather for proof of the` enhanced stability' limitation the district_court required astra to demonstrate the presence of an inert_subcoating and a drug_core having a micro-ph of not less than 7
that proof requirement is supported by the specifications of the ¡¬230 and ¡¬505_patent_s which teach that the result of using an inert_subcoating and an arc is increased stability

*1371 finally we reject impaxs argument that this courts decision in warner-lambert co. v. teva pharmaceuticals usa inc. 418_f.3d_1326_(fed.cir.2005) requires reversal of the district_courts finding of infringement
in that case warner-lambert sued teva for infringement of a claim that required` a suitable amount of an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate to inhibit cyclization and discoloration'
the district_court granted warner-lamberts motion for summary judgment of infringement
we reversed after determining that teva had pointed to a genuine issue of material fact` as to whether the magnesium carbonate in tevas formulation inhibits oxidative discoloration'
id.at 1342
by contrast the district_court in this case acting as finder of fact made a factual_determination based on the evidence presented at trial that impaxs inert_subcoating and arc increased the stability of its formulation

2
impaxs second challenge to the district_courts decision on infringement is based on the courts finding that impaxs formulation met the` inert_subcoating' limitation of both patents
astra presented evidence that in impaxs product an inert_subcoating_forms in situ between the enteric_coating and the drug_core_region
astras evidence showed the presence in impaxs product of a hydroxypropyl_methylcellulose_phthalate` hpmcp' salt in the region between the enteric_coating and the drug_core
impax argues that astras evidence was insufficient to establish infringement because astra did not prove the mechanism by which the salt forms ; because the test astra used to detect the presence of hpmcp salt is incapable of detecting sodium ; and because the tests showed traces of omeprazole

the district_court correctly rejected each of those arguments
first to prove infringement astra did not need to identify the process by which the infringing subcoating was produced ; it was sufficient for it to show the presence of the claimed structure
in any event the district_court credited testimony by dr._davies astras expert in which he stated that the hpmcp salt layer results from a reaction between hpmcp in the enteric_coating and dibasic sodium hydrogen phosphate in the drug_core
second impaxs argument challenging the tests that were used to show the presence of the inert_subcoating is misleading
impax relies on the testimony of dr._davies that sodium atoms can not be detected by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy` atr-ftir'
dr._davies however testified that his atr-ftir_data revealed the presence of a carboxylate group which indicated the presence of hpmcp in the subcoating
finally with respect to the evidence of the presence of omeprazole in the test results dr._davies testified that the omeprazole peaks in his spectral data could be explained in two ways omeprazole may have entered the subcoating but only in trace amounts allowed by the claims ; or the atr-ftir may have picked up weak signals from the omeprazole in the drug_core
the district_court credited that testimony
we therefore find that the record supports the district_courts determination that impaxs formulation infringes astras patents

c. finally impax challenges the district_courts findings with respect to the public-use_bar under section 102 b
astra filed its applications for the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent s on april_20,_1987
the critical_date of the patents is therefore april_20,_1986
before that date astra commissioned four large clinical_studies to determine the safety and efficacy of its formulation *1372 in order to obtain fda approval
at trial impax argued that the studies involved the public_use of astras claimed formulation
the district_court ruled against impax on two grounds
first the court ruled that the studies constituted experimental_uses and therefore not public_uses of the claimed invention
second the court ruled that the patented formulation was not ready for patenting until after the studies were completed
impax challenges each of those findings

1
we agree with impax that the district_court misapplied this circuits law with respect to the experimental_use_exception
the district_court found that even if astras formulation had been reduced to practice before or during the clinical_studies the studies were experimental and therefore negated the public-use_bar to patentability
impax correctly points out however that it is clear from this courts case law that experimental_use can not negate a public_use when it is shown that the invention was reduced to practice before the experimental_use
see cargill inc. v. canbra foods ltd. 476_f.3d_1359 1371_n._10_(fed.cir.2007) ; allen eng g corp. v. bartell indus. inc. 299_f.3d_1336 1354 fed.cir.2002 ; new railhead mfg. llc v. vermeer mfg co. 298_f.3d_1290 1299 fed.cir.2002 ; ez dock inc. v. schafer sys. inc. 276_f.3d_1347 1357 fed.cir.2002 linn j. concurring ; zacharin v. united states 213_f.3d_1366 1369 fed.cir.2000 ; baxter int l inc. v. cobe labs. inc. 88_f.3d_1054 1060 fed.cir.1996
but see atlanta attachment co. v. leggett & platt inc. 516_f.3d_1361 1368-69 fed.cir.2008 prost j. concurring
we therefore do not agree with the district_courts ruling that the experimental_use_exception served to negate the public-use_bar to patentability

2
we may nevertheless affirm the district_courts conclusion that the claims were not invalid under section 102 b based on the courts factual_determination that the claimed formulation was not ready for patenting until after the clinical_studies were completed
see pfaff v. wells electronics inc. 525_u.s._55 67 119_s.ct._304 142_l.ed.2d_261_(1998) ; invitrogen corp. v. biocrest mfg. l.p. 424_f.3d_1374 1380 fed.cir.2005` the ready for patenting component of pfaffs two-part test [ is ] another necessary requirement of a public_use_bar`
the district_court found that the claimed formulation was not reduced to practice before the clinical_trials were completed and we uphold that finding

according to the undisputed facts of this case omeprazole was first created by astras scientists in 1979 12 years after astras predecessor had begun a research project to develop a drug capable of inhibiting gastric_acid_secretion

once the compound was developed a team of astras scientists turned their focus to developing an oral dosage form of the drug a task that proved difficult because of omeprazoles unstable nature in certain environments
two scientists on that team were drs
ake pilbrant and kurt lovgren two of the named inventors of the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent_s. in the first human trials the phase i trials astra employed a buffered suspension to stabilize omeprazole in the acidic environment of the stomach
222 f.supp.2d at 435
to create a dosage suitable for commercialization drs
pilbrant and lovgren added an enteric_coating to an omeprazole drug_core
after performing studies that showed that the enteric_coating did not cause the omeprazole to degrade any more than was caused by other_excipients the inventors decided to proceed with an enteric-coated formulation

*1373 after testing various formulations with an enteric_coating the inventors finally came up with a formulation that appeared sufficiently promising to warrant testing in the phase ii clinical_trials
that formulation used an enteric_coating of hydroxypropyl_methylcellulose_phthalate to cover a drug_core containing omeprazole combined with arcs and other_excipients
the phase_ii_formulation ultimately proved to have insufficient gastric_acid_resistance and insufficient long-term shelf life
drs
pilbrant and lovgren along with other astra_scientists then set out to develop a formulation that would solve both of those problems

that task proved difficult because the two goals seemingly conflicted
increasing shelf life required stabilizing omeprazole in an alkaline_environment
yet the acidic enteric_coating would be less effective at providing gastric_acid_resistance when in contact with alkaline_compounds
the scientists tried a number of modifications to the phase_ii_formulation until drs
pilbrant and lovgren decided to use a subcoating between the enteric_coating and the drug_core
they attempted inserting a water-soluble subcoat although they expected that the subcoat might prove ineffective because it would dissolve in the water that leaked through the enteric_coating
if that were the case the omeprazole in the drug_core would degrade because of its sensitivity to water
their laboratory experiments revealed however that the water-soluble_subcoating increased gastric_acid_resistance and long-term_stability
based on those tests the group decided to use the formulation in the phase iii clinical_trials
the results of those trials revealed gastric_acid_resistance well in excess of astras goal together with three years of shelf stability

in pfaff the supreme_court described two ways for a party to show that an invention was ready for patenting before the critical_date of section 102 b` by proof of reduction to practice before the critical_date ; or by proof that prior to the critical_date the inventor had prepared drawings or other descriptions of the invention that were sufficiently specific to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention'
525 u.s. at 67-68 119_s.ct._304
in attempting to demonstrate that the invention was ready for patenting impax has sought to show that the phase_iii_formulation had been reduced to practice before astra conducted the phase iii clinical_trials

at trial impax bore the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing_evidence that the phase_iii_formulation had been reduced to practice before the testing began
see z4 techs. inc. v. microsoft corp. 507_f.3d_1340 1352 fed.cir.2007
to demonstrate reduction to practice a party must prove that the inventor 1` constructed an embodiment or performed a process that met all the limitations' and 2` determined that the invention would work for its intended_purpose'
id
( quoting cooper v. goldfarb 154_f.3d_1321 1327 fed.cir.1998
`` testing is required to demonstrate reduction to practice in some instances because without such testing there can not be sufficient certainty that the invention will work for its intended_purpose'
id
( quoting slip track sys. inc. v. metal-lite inc. 304_f.3d_1256 1267 fed.cir.2002
we review the district_courts factual_determinations as to the necessity and sufficiency of testing for clear_error

the district_court found that the phase_iii_formulation was not reduced to practice before the trials because the evidence showed that at that time the inventors believed only that the formulation` might solve the twin problems of in vivo_stability and long-term storage'
the district_court found that` the phase_iii_formulation still *1374 required extensive clinical testing and real-time_stability_testing to determine whether it could treat gastric acid diseases safely and effectively'

relying on taskett v. dentlinger 344_f.3d_1337_(fed.cir.2003) impax argues that the district_court committed clear_error in finding that the inventors had not reduced their formulation to practice before the phase iii clinical_trials
in taskett the issue was whether the board of patent appeals and interferences erred in concluding that the junior party dentlinger had reduced to practice the limitation` obtaining financial authorization' when the record indicated that dentlinger had not commercially tested that feature of his invention
id.at 1341-42
the board relied on the testimony of two of dentlingers employees and a dated test_receipt to conclude that dentlinger had proved reduction to practice by a preponderance of the evidence
this court affirmed finding the boards decision to be supported by substantial evidence based on the employees testimony and the test_receipt relied on by the board in addition to evidence in the record that the limitation had been well tested in the field
id.at 1342

taskett provides limited support for impax because in this case the district_court found that there was insufficient evidence to support a factual_determination that the phase_iii_formulation had been reduced to practice
impax must therefore show that the district_court committed clear_error in finding as a factual matter that drs
pilbrant and lovgren did not determine that the phase_iii_formulation would have sufficient in vivo and long-term_stability before the phase_iii_trials
impax has not made that showing

impaxs challenge to the district_courts finding begins with its assertion that the astra_scientists had conceived and produced the phase_iii_formulation before the clinical_trials
it is not disputed that the phase_iii_formulation had been produced before the trials
the existence of the formulation however does not establish that the astra_scientists had determined that the invention would work for its intended_purpose

impax further asserts that the stability of the phase_iii_formulation had been confirmed in may 1983 before the phase_iii_trials were conducted
to support that assertion impax relies on the testimony of dr._pilbrant
dr._pilbrant confirmed that laboratory testing of the phase_iii_formulation conducted before the clinical_trials revealed that the phase_iii_formulation possessed significantly increased gastric_acid_resistance over the predecessor formulations
dr._pilbrant however further testified that as of may 1983 the astra_scientists did not have enough information to satisfy themselves that the phase_iii_formulation would work for its intended_purpose
instead he testified that the astra_scientists thought the phase_iii_formulation` had a good possibility to be used as a marketing drug' but that the team did not have long-term_stability data and had` no experience of how it performed in clinical_studies'

impax also relies on the portion of dr._pilbrants testimony in which he stated that before the trials he knew` for sure that the stability of the phase iii formulation or the invention was better than the phase ii formulation'
that assertion also does not undermine the district_courts determination regarding reduction to practice
the district_court found that the phase_iii_formulation still required testing to determine whether that formulation would be sufficiently stable to treat gastrointestinal_disease effectively
the phase_iii_formulation may have been more stable than the phase_ii_formulation but that does not establish that the phase_iii_formulation *1375 would be stable enough to provide an effective_treatment

impax points to the testimony of dr._carlsson in support of its contention that the phase_iii_formulation was adopted in 1983
dr._carlsson testified however that the purpose of the phase_iii_trials was to assess the formulations safety and efficacy stating that it was not until all phase_iii_trials were completed that safety and efficacy could be documented
the district_court relied on that testimony in finding that the inventors had not determined that the phase_iii_formulation would have sufficient long-term and in vivo_stability to produce a formulation effective to treat gastrointestinal_disease
impax has not pointed to any evidence showing that the clinical_trials were not necessary to allow the astra_scientists to conclude that the phase_iii_formulation would have sufficient long-term and in vivo_stability to serve as an effective_treatment

impax contends that the district_court misapprehended the intended_purpose of the phase_iii_trials when it stated that the astra_scientists were` still in the process of determining [ during those trials ] whether the phase_iii_formulation could safely and effectively be used as amethod of treatment of gastrointestinal_disease
`` impax argues that it was known in 1979-the year astra filed its first patent application for omeprazole-that omeprazole could provide a safe and effective_treatment

impaxs argument misses the point
the astra_scientists had long understood that omeprazole could provide a safe and effective_treatment for certain gastrointestinal_diseases
the challenge they faced was developing a formulation to deliver omeprazole to the small_intestine a challenge that was made difficult by omeprazoles sensitivity to acidic environments such as the stomach
impax has not demonstrated that without conducting the phase iii clinical tests the inventors knew that the phase_iii_formulation would achieve the goals of long-term_stability and in vivo_stability such that it would be effective as a treatment for gastrointestinal_disease
we therefore find no clear_error in the district_courts finding on this issue

d. finally we address impaxs challenge to the district_courts order denying impaxs demand for a jury_trial
impax argues that the district_courts order violated its seventh amendment right to a trial by jury because its antitrust_counterclaims presented factual issues that were common to its invalidity counterclaims
we rejected that argument when reviewing impaxs petition for a writ of mandamus on this issue two years ago
in re impax labs. inc. 171_fed.appx._839_(fed.cir.2006)
impax has not pointed to any extraordinary_circumstances that would justify our revisiting that decision
we therefore adhere to our prior ruling as the law of the case
see christianson v. colt indus
operating corp. 486_u.s._800 817 108_s.ct._2166 100_l.ed.2d_811_(1988)` a court has the power to revisit prior decisions of its own or of a coordinate court in any circumstance although as a rule courts should be loath to do so in the absence of extraordinary_circumstances such as where the initial decision wasclearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice
`` ; maldonado v. flynn 671_f.2d_729 732 2d cir.1982` mandamus is the accepted method to review an order denying a claimed right of trial by jury.. consequently denial of the petition for mandamus in this matter is the law of the case
``

iii
we now turn to apotexs appeal
like impax apotex filed an anda for *1376 10- 20- and 40-mg generic omeprazole products and certified in its application that the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent s were invalid or not infringed
astra filed suit against apotex and astras claims against apotex were heard by the district_court during the same bench_trial in which astras claims against impax were heard
based on testimony from dr._davies the district_court ruled that apotexs formulation infringed both patents
the district_court also rejected apotexs anticipation and obviousness defenses
the court therefore ordered the effective_date of apotexs anda to be october 20 2007 to reflect astras period of market_exclusivity
apotex challenges the findings of infringement the courts rulings on anticipation and obviousness and the courts order to set the effective_date to the end of astras exclusivity period

a. apotexs formulation contains a pellet_core consisting of omeprazole povidone` pvp' magnesium hydroxide and mannitol
apotex applies to the pellet_core an enteric_coating made from a solution of water methacrylic acid copolymer` macp' and triethyl citrate
even though apotex does not apply a subcoating during the manufacturing_process dr._davies testified that apotexs pellets infringe because a subcoating_forms in situ from a reaction between the macp in the enteric_coating and the pvp in the pellet_core
dr._davies demonstrated the presence of a subcoating in apotexs pellets with confocal laser scanning microscopy` clsm' fluorescence and reflectance_images
dr._daviess clsm_fluorescence_images showed a fluorescent_band in apotexs accused pellets
when dr._daviess clsm_fluorescence_images were overlaid with his clsm_reflectance_images the fluorescent_band was shown to lie at the surface of the drug_core and to have a thickness of about 2_to_6 microns

additionally dr._davies washed some of apotexs pellets in acetone and isopropanol` acetone ipa' to remove the enteric_coating
his clsm fluorescence and reflectance_images of the washed pellets likewise showed a fluorescent layer at the surface of the drug_core
to determine the composition of the fluorescent_band dr._davies used atr-ftir_data
most pertinent to the district_courts finding of infringement he compared the spectrum of the surface of the washed pellets to the spectrum of a macp pvp reference
the spectrum of the washed pellets surface showed a peak at 1633 cm -1
dr._davies testified that when pvp reacts with macp the pvp spectrum shows a shift from 1670 cm -big_token__1_to_1630__big_token cm -1 as a result of the formation of a complex between the carbonyl groups of pvp and the carboxyl groups of macp
dr._davies additionally showed that the properties of the macp pvp complex were different from pvp and macp alone by performing ph testing on the three compounds
based on the evidence from dr._daviess testing the district_court concluded that apotexs pellets have a continuous water-soluble_subcoating that is formed in situ
apotex challenges the sufficiency of that evidence

1
apotex first argues that even if a subcoating_forms in situ the subcoating is not a` subcoating.. disposed on said core_region' within the meaning of the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent s because apotex does not directly apply a subcoating during its manufacturing_process
we rejected that argument in the appeal from the district_courts first_wave_trial based on our conclusion that the phrase` [ d ] isposed on does not specify any method or structure involved in application of the subcoating'
84_fed.appx._76 80 fed.cir.2003
we reject that argument in this appeal for the same reason

*1377 apotex also argues that its manufacturing_process merely practices the prior_art citing european_patent_application no
ep 124,495 a2` the ¡¬495_european_application'
it is well established however that` practicing the prior_art' is not a defense to infringement
tate access floors inc. v. interface architectural res. inc. 279_f.3d_1357 1365-69 fed.cir.2002 ; baxter healthcare corp. v. spectramed inc. 49_f.3d_1575 1583 fed.cir.1995

2
apotex next argues that the district_court erred in concluding that the fluorescent_band was formed by an macp pvp complex and not by omeprazole and its degradation_products
in making that argument apotex relies on evidence from its experts dr._signorino and dr._cima
dr._signorino created` anda_reproduction_pellets' by following apotexs anda specification along with a series of` modified anda_reproduction_pellets' one version of which was made without omeprazole
dr._cima then obtained uv fluorescent images of the anda_reproduction_pellets and the modified pellets
his images showed a fluorescent_band in the anda_reproduction_pellets but no band in the modified pellets that lacked omeprazole

the district_court found that dr._signorinos reproduction pellets were not comparable to apotexs accused products
the court reached that conclusion for a number of reasons the size of the samples produced was smaller than the fda would require for a pilot scale batch the enteric_coating of the pellets was half the size of the coating of apotexs anda samples dr._signorino did not know the temperature at which his pellets were made he coated his pellets for half as long as apotexs products and he added more water than apotexs anda specified
the court further noted that the modified pellets lacking omeprazole had higher solid content than was called for by apotexs anda
based on those differences between dr._signorinos pellets and apotexs product the district_court gave greater weight to the testimony of dr._davies
that decision was reasonable and did not result in a clearly erroneous finding of infringement

apotex also asserts that dr._daviess wash procedure undermines astras claim that the subcoating was formed by an macp pvp complex
apotex argues that the macp pvp complex may have formed when dr._davies washed apotexs pellets in acetone ipa
apotex bases that argument on experiments performed by dr._cima which apotex argues show that macp and pvp can react in acetone ipa
the district_court found that dr._cimas experiments were flawed because dr._cima was able to create a reaction in acetone ipa only under extreme conditions including heating the mixture at 100 degrees centigrade for 25 minutes or drying the mixture in a vacuum for 11 hours
the court also observed that dr._cimas atr-ftir_data showed artifacts resulting from atmospheric_suppression a correction algorithm that suppresses spectral_peaks from water vapor at the cost of introducing minor artifacts
astra showed that when dr._cimas data was calculated with atmospheric_suppression turned off dr._cimas macp pvp spectral_peaks disappeared

apotex further argues that the district_court should have credited dr._cimas raman microspectroscopy evidence which according to apotex showed that omeprazole and its degradation_products were present in the fluorescent_band
the court however had ample reason to attach little weight to dr._cimas evidence
the court noted that dr._cima had normalized his data leading to absurd results
*1378 his normalized data showed mannitol an ingredient in the drug_core distributed equally throughout the entire pellet and it showed more omeprazole in the enteric_coating than in the drug_core while dr._cimas non-normalized data showed mannitol and omeprazole concentrated in the drug_core

apotex also argues for reversal based on evidence from pellets produced by dr._signorino according to the teachings of the ¡¬495_european_application
dr._signorino produced pellets both with and without omeprazole
in those samples dr._cima observed fluorescent_bands in the pellets containing omeprazole while not observing any bands in the pellets that did not contain omeprazole
apotex argues that the district_court erred when it discounted that evidence based on dr._signorinos failure to follow the teachings of the ¡¬495_european_application
even if the conditions used to make the pellets were irrelevant to whether omeprazole caused the observed fluoresence the district_court correctly noted that evidence regarding infringement must compare the claims to the accused product
that omeprazole might cause fluorescence in the ¡¬495_european_application pellets does not refute astras evidence that a different compound caused fluorescence in apotexs pellets

finally apotex argues that astras evidence failed to show the presence of a continuous subcoating
specifically apotex points to dr._daviess clsm_reflectance_images of apotexs pellets that had been washed with acetone ipa and it argues that neither of those images shows the subcoating completely surrounding the pellet_core
dr._davies however explained that what appears in a clsm reflectance image depends on the angle of the surface of the pellet to the light
at certain angles the pellet will reflect light away from the detector for a portion of the image
the district_court credited dr._daviess explanation of the clsm evidence and doing so did not render its ultimate finding clearly erroneous

3
apotex also appears to challenge the district_courts conclusion that the inert_subcoating in apotexs pellets is water soluble
dr._davies prepared a video of a washed pellet disintegrating in an aqueous solution
apotex argues that the video did not actually show the subcoating disintegrating but rather showed the disintegration of portions of the enteric_coating that allegedly remained on the pellet after dr._davies washed the pellets in acetone ipa
in rejecting apotexs argument the district_court relied on dr._daviess clsm reflectance and fluorescence images which showed that no portions of the enteric_coating remained after the washing procedure
because we have found no error in the district_courts reliance on dr._daviess clsm images we affirm the courts conclusion that dr._daviess video demonstrated the water solubility of the inert_subcoating

b. apotex next argues that the claims of the ¡¬230_patent were anticipated by u.s. patent no._2991,226` the ¡¬226_patent` u.s._patent_no._4470,980` the ¡¬980_patent` and european_patent_application no
ep 122 815 a1` the ¡¬815_european_application'
the district_court found that those three references do not disclose an` acid_labile pharmaceutically active_substance' which the court construed to refer to compounds that are unstable in acidic conditions and have better_stability in alkaline_conditions
the court further found that the ¡¬226 and ¡¬980_patent_s do not disclose formulations that use an` alkaline_salt'
apotex does not challenge the district_courts factual findings *1379 but rather argues that the district_courts constructions of` acid_labile' and` alkaline_salt' are incorrect

the district_court construed` alkaline_salt' to mean a salt with a basic_ph
citing the testimony of its expert dr._block apotex argues that the phrase should be construed to mean a salt having an element from groups i or ii of the periodic table the alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals respectively
the district_court however struck the portion of dr._blocks testimony on which apotex now relies because dr._block did not provide in his expert reports or in his deposition testimony his opinion that` alkaline_salt' does not simply mean a salt with a basic_ph
in any event apotexs construction draws no support from the specification of the ¡¬230_patent and it would contradict claim 8s recitation of an ammonium salt as a possible alkaline_salt
as ammonium salts do not fall within apotexs construction the claims of the ¡¬230_patent themselves do not support apotexs proposed construction
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1314 fed.cir.2005 en banc` because claim terms are normally used consistently throughout the patent the usage of a term in one claim can often illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims`
we therefore reject apotexs construction and because apotex does not challenge the district_courts findings under the courts construction we affirm the district_courts determination that the ¡¬226 and ¡¬980_patent_s do not anticipate the claims of the ¡¬230_patent

with respect to the ¡¬815_european_application apotex argues that the district_courts determination was based on an erroneous construction of the phrase` acid_labile pharmaceutically active_substance'
apotex argues that the phrase should be construed to mean a pharmaceutical that is labile in acid media and that the district_court erroneously imported an additional_limitation requiring acid_labile substances to have better_stability in alkaline_conditions
the district_courts conclusion however was not based on that additional_limitation
rather the district_court found that the active_substance in the ¡¬815_european_application-m-4_carboxylic_acid-is stable in acid
that finding was supported by expert testimony that the goal of the ¡¬815_european_application was to release m-4_carboxylic_acid at low ph levels implying that the compound is not labile in acid
we therefore affirm the district_courts ruling that the ¡¬815_european_application does not anticipate the claims of the ¡¬230_patent

c. apotex next argues that all the claims of both the ¡¬230 and ¡¬505_patent_s would have been obvious in light of the combination of the teachings of the ¡¬495_european_application with several other references
the other references apotex cites are the ¡¬226_patent the ¡¬980_patent the ¡¬815_european_application and two articles-pharmaceutical manufacturing methods in 1 basic course in drug development xi kyosuke tsuda & hsashi nogami eds. 1971` tsuda' and drug coatings in up-to-date pharmaceutical technology series no._1 kiichiro kakemi ed. 1969` up-to-date'

example 12 of the ¡¬495_european_application describes a tablet containing omeprazole_magnesium_salt with a cellulose acetate phthalate enteric_coating
the district_court found that the ¡¬495_european_application does not disclose tablets with any sort of subcoating or tablets containing an arc
the court further observed that the ¡¬495_european_application does not disclose or suggest a negative_interaction between the drug_core and the enteric_coating
apotex relies on a number of references that disclose the use of subcoatings *1380 in various pharmaceutical preparations in support of its argument that it would have been obvious to one of skill in the art to apply an inert_subcoating to example 12 of the ¡¬495_european_application
none of the references on which apotex relies however undermine the trial courts conclusion that the claims of the ¡¬230 and ¡¬505_patent_s would not have been obvious to a person of skill in the art

apotex was required to show by clear and convincing_evidence that a person of skill in the art would have appreciated the need to include a subcoating in example 12 of the ¡¬495_european_application
the district_court however found that the ¡¬495_european_application does not disclose or suggest a negative_interaction between the drug_core containing the magnesium omeprazole salt and the enteric_coating in example 12
the court further found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have inferred from the ¡¬495_european_application that a negative_interaction would occur
based on those findings the court concluded that a person of ordinary_skill would have had no reason to apply a subcoating to the tablets shown in example 12 of the ¡¬495_european_application

to overcome that shortcoming of the ¡¬495_european_application apotex relies on testimony from dr._block that` [ a ] person of ordinary_skill would understand that cellulose acetate phthalate has free carboxylic acid groups and could interact with the omeprazole_magnesium_salt the omeprazole being acid-labile'
the district_court was presented with ample evidence to support the contrary conclusion however
dr._langer astras expert testified that the ¡¬ 495 european_application does not suggest any problem relating to the interaction of the enteric_coating and the drug_core
furthermore dr._langer and apotexs expert dr._signorino agreed that the disclosure in the ¡¬495_european_application does not suggest any need to stabilize omeprazole beyond using the salt form
dr._langer also testified that a 1985 article by dr._pilbrant one of the named inventors of the ¡¬230 and ¡¬505_patent_s provided further support for the view that a person of skill in the art would not have believed that an enteric_coating would create a problem resulting from contact with omeprazole
see pilbrant a
& cederburg c. development of an oral formulation of omeprazole 20 scandinavian j. gastroenterology suppl
108 at 113 1985
the pilbrant & cederburg article states that` an enteric-coated dosage form which does not release the active_ingredient for dissolution and absorption until it has been transported down to the neutral reacting part of the small_intestine offers the best possibilities'
based on that evidence the district_court reasonably concluded that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have seen any need to apply to example 12 of the ¡¬495_european_application the teachings of the references disclosing subcoatings

even if a person of skill in the art would have recognized that there would be a negative_interaction between the enteric_coating and the drug_core the district_court found that it would not have been obvious to try applying a water-soluble_subcoating as a means of solving that problem
the district_court gave lengthy consideration to the multiple paths that would have faced a person of ordinary_skill in the art who recognized the stability problem resulting from a directly applied enteric_coating
first one recognizing the problem might have decided to abandon the enteric_coating altogether
the prior_art shows formulations using a syrup with an alkaline_omeprazole_salt a liquid suspension of omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate or omeprazole granules administered with an antacid
see ¡¬495_european_application example 11 ; pilbrant & cederburg at 114 118-20
second one might *1381 instead have modified the enteric_coating for instance by removing monomers and small acidic pieces from the coating or by using an inert coating
third one might have altered the drug_core by adding an antioxidant such as cysteine sodium ascorbate or sodium sulfite
finally even if one had decided to use a subcoating one would not necessarily have used a water-soluble_subcoating since omeprazole is moisture-sensitive and needs to be delivered to the alkaline_environment of the small_intestine without degrading in the stomach
one of skill in the art would therefore have likely tried a non-soluble_subcoating or a subcoating containing a fatty acid

apotex further argues that the claims of the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent s would have been obvious in light of a list of 15 other prior_art references
two of those references-the eastman_brochures-were found not to be printed publications
apotex does not identify any clear_error in the district_courts conclusion with regard to those references
apotex was required to show that the eastman_brochures were accessible to members of the public interested in the prior_art
see in re hall 781_f.2d_897 899 fed.cir.1986
apotex presented testimony from an employee of eastman_chemical the company that produced the brochures
the employee could not however provide information about the circulation and availability of the brochures in the 1960s or 1970s the period during which the brochures were produced

apotex also asserts that the district_court erred by not addressing the testimony of dr._block who stated that he received one of the eastman_brochures in 1964
the evidence that dr._block received a single brochure from eastman_chemical in 1964 does little if anything to make up for the lack of evidence regarding eastman_chemicals distribution practices
with respect to the 13 other references apotex has not indicated how those references demonstrate that the claims of the ¡¬505 and ¡¬230_patent s would have been obvious

finally apotex argues that the district_courts analysis conflicts with the analysis required by the supreme_courts decision in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) because the district_court insisted on absolute predictability instead of a reasonable expectation of success and because the district_court failed to recognize that adding a subcoating would be` obvious to try' a standard referred to in ksr
apotex however mischaracterizes the district_courts decision
the court found that a person of skill in the art would not have seen a reason to insert a subcoating in the prior_art formulation shown in example 12 of the ¡¬ 495 european_application
the courts finding was based on apotexs failure to demonstrate that a person of skill in the art would conclude that a negative_interaction would take place between the enteric_coating and the drug_core

in sum based on the district_courts thorough analysis of the prior_art and the nature of the problem we find no error in the courts findings of fact and conclusions of law on the question of obviousness

d. like impax apotex also argues that the district_court erred in resetting the effective_date of its anda to reflect astras six-month_period of market_exclusivity
as we discussed with respect to impaxs appeal the district_court had jurisdiction to provide relief under section 271 e 4 a despite the expiration of astras patents
and even if the district_courts order were defective in some other way apotexs challenge to the merits of that order would be *1382 moot because astras period of exclusivity has lapsed

iv
the judgments of the district_court declaring astras patents enforceable not invalid and infringed are affirmed
we also affirm the courts ruling that it had jurisdiction to reset the effective_date of impaxs and apotexs andas to reflect astras period of market_exclusivity

affirmed

this court continues to have jurisdiction in the impax case because of the pending claim for attorney fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
in the apotex case claims for damages are at issue so the expiration of the patents does not render that case moot
