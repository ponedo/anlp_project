gajarsa circuit_judge
medichem s.a.` medichem' appeals the decision of the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york following a bench trial that there was no interference-in-fact under *930 35 u.s.c.¡± 291 between the claimed inventions of u.s. patent nos._6084,100 the` ¡¬100_patent` belonging to medichem and 6,093,827 the` ¡¬827_patent` belonging to rolabo s.l

medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. no._01- cv-3087 s.d.n.y
may_9,_2002` district_court_opinion'
rolabo cross-appeals the district_courts conclusion that this was not an exceptional case under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 and its denial of rolabos request for attorney_fees
because we find the district_court erred in its application of the two-way_test we vacate its priority_determination reverse its conclusion that the ¡¬827_patent was neither anticipated nor obvious in light of the ¡¬100_patent and remand for further_proceedings consistent with this opinion
as further_proceedings are necessary any resolution of rolabos request for attorney_fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 is at this time premature

background
a
the patents
medichem is a barcelona-based manufacturer of pharmaceutical_ingredients
the company is the assignee of the ¡¬100_patent entitled` process for the preparation of loratadine'
loratadine is an antihistamine that is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the popular allergy medication claritinthe_r
rolabo is also a manufacturer of pharmaceutical_ingredients based in barcelona spain and is the assignee of the ¡¬827_patent entitled` process for the preparation of 10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzoa [ a d ] cyclohept-5-enes and derivatives thereof' which like the ¡¬100_patent is a process for the preparation of loratadine

claims 1_and_2 of the ¡¬100_patent claim read 1
a process for the preparation of loratadine consisting of reacting in an organic solvent and in the presence of a tertiary_amine 8-chloro-5,6-dihyrobenzo [ 5,6 ] cyclohepta [ 1,2-b ] pyridin-11-one of formula vii with a low-valent_titanium_species
2
the process of claim 1 wherein the low-valent_titanium_species are generated by reduction of titanium tetrachloride with zinc dust
¡¬100_patent col._5,_l._59 to col._6,_l._21
claims 1_and_17 of the ¡¬827_patent read 1
a process for preparing 5,6-dihydro-11h-dibenzo [ a d ] cyclohept-11-enes comprising reacting a dibenzosuberone or an aza derivative thereof with an aliphatic ketone in the presence of low-valent_titanium wherein said low-valent_titanium is generated by zinc
17
a process as claimed in claim 1 for preparing loratadine
¡¬827_patent col._5,_ll._34-38 col._8,_ll._3-4 emphasis added
both the ¡¬100 and the ¡¬827_patent_s involve chemical reactions generally known in the art as` mcmurry' reactions after professor john mcmurry who described the intermolecular coupling between the different carbonyl groups in a compound using low-valent_titanium in a 1989 publication

proceedings to date

district court proceedings
medichem filed a complaint under 35 u.s.c.¡± 291 against rolabo in the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york on april_13,_2001
section 291 entitled` interfering patents' provides a cause of action to one patent_owner against another patent_owner where the inventions claimed by their respective patents interfere with one another
addressing priority first the district_court found that the evidence submitted by medichem supported an invention_date in the fall of 1996 for the ¡¬100_patent
since rolabo did not allege an invention_date *931 prior to the fall of 1996 the district_court awarded priority to medichem

the district_court turned next to the issue of interference-in-fact between the ¡¬100 and ¡¬827_patent_s and announced that it was applying the two-way_test for identifying an interference provided in the patent and trademark organizations` pto' regulation 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.601 n
under the two-way_test the district_court first treated the ¡¬100_patent as prior_art identifying the key question as` whether the inclusion of tertiary_amine in medichems patent claims is material in a way that negates obviousness and makes the patents noninterfering
`` 1 because of the presence of a tertiary_amine throughout the ¡¬100_patents claims and examples the district_court found that a tertiary_amine would appear to a reader of the ¡¬ 100 patent as a necessary component of medichems process
absent the tertiary_amine the district_court explained it would not be obvious that the same result could be achieved
therefore the absence of a tertiary_amine_requirement in the ¡¬827_patent` strongly suggest [ ed ]' that the two processes were materially different

continuing its analysis under the interference_inquiry the district_court assessed whether one of ordinary_skill in the art would find the elimination of a tertiary_amine obvious or anticipated in light of the ¡¬100_patent and the prior_art in 1996 the invention_date of the ¡¬100_patent
the district_court accepted each of the parties expert witnesses five in all as representative of the ordinary_skill in the relevant art of synthetic organic chemistry
all witnesses were not however determined by the district_court to be equally credible in their testimony
ultimately the district_court relied entirely on the testimony of rolabos third expert dr._leckta

dr._leckta confirmed the district_courts belief that while a person of skill in the art in 1996 would have understood the role of the tertiary_amine in medichems process the result if the tertiary_amine were omitted would not have been obvious
the tertiary_amine dr._leckta noted was significant in aiding medichems process for creating loratadine but also had drawbacks in the form of longer reaction times lower yields and additional workup time
based on its conclusion that the removal of the tertiary_amine would not be obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art in 1996 the district_court found that one leg of the two-way_test i.e. treating the ¡¬100_patent as prior_art required by the ptos test for interferences under section 1.601 n was not satisfied and as a result there could be no interference-in-fact
the district_court did not reach the second_leg of the two-way_test
medichem timely appealed the district_courts finding of no interference and rolabo cross-appealed the district_courts denial of attorney_fees under ¡± 285
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

interim pto proceedings
on december 11 2002 during the interim period between the district_courts resolution of the case and the date on which rolabo filed its brief in this court the board of patent_appeals and interferences` board' declared an interference-in-fact between claim 2 of the ¡¬100_patent and claim 17 of the ¡¬827_patent

& int
dec._11,_2002
the boards proceedings occurred *932 under the parallel interference procedures of 35 u.s.c.¡± 135 a which govern interferences between an application for a patent and another pending application or unexpired patent
these requirements were met in this instance because on september 3 2002 stampa one of the listed inventors on the ¡¬100_patent had filed reissue application no._10 /234,659 the` ¡¬659 reissue' for the ¡¬ 100 patent
a reissue application qualifies as an application under ¡± 135 a

the board began by concluding that a ¡± 291 proceeding did not preclude the director of the pto from declaring an interference under ¡± 135 a due to the difference in statutory requirements
stampa 2002_wl_31926813 -- -- - -- -- 65 uspq2d at -- -- 2002 pat.app
lexis 191 at *9-*18 ; see also masco corp. v. united states 303_f.3d_1316 1329 fed.cir.2002` issue preclusion is appropriate only when.. 1 the issue is identical to one decided in the first_action ; 2 the issue was actually litigated in the first_action ; 3 resolution of the issue was essential to a final judgment in the first_action ; and 4 plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first_action`
the board like the district_court applied the two-way_test described by 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.601 n to identify the existence of an interference-in-fact between the reissue application and the ¡¬ 827 patent
unlike the district_court however the board found that the term` comprising' in the transition of claim 1 of the ¡¬827_patent permitted the inclusion of additional elements including tertiary_amines
because tertiary_amines were not excluded from the ¡¬827_patent claim 17 was anticipated by claim 2 of the ¡¬100_patent
applying the second_leg of the two-way_test-treating the ¡¬827_patent as prior_art2-the board found that the use of tertiary_amines to carry out mcmurry_reactions was well known in the art
therefore the board concluded the second_leg of the two-way_test was also satisfied resulting in an interference-in-fact

discussion
a
standard of review
this court has only indirectly addressed the standard used in reviewing a district_courts conclusions regarding interference under 35 u.s.c.¡± 291
see advance transformer co. v. levinson 837_f.2d_1081 1083 fed.cir.1988 upholding a district_court determination of no interference where that conclusion was not` shown to be clearly erroneous'
by pto regulation however the underlying questions to the interference-in-fact inquiry are those of anticipation and obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102-103
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.601 j` an interference-in-fact exists when at least one claim of a party that is designated to correspond to a count and at least one claim of an opponent that is designated to correspond to the count define the same_patentable_invention'
( emphasis added ; ¡± 1.601 n` invention a is the same_patentable_invention as an invention b when invention a is the same as 35_u.s.c._102 or is obvious 35_u.s.c._103 in view of invention b assuming invention b is prior_art with respect to invention a'
( emphasis added ; see also eli_lilly & co. v. bd
of regents of the univ
of wash. 334_f.3d_1264 1267-69 fed.cir.2003
following from the two-way_test the standards of review for an interference-in-fact should mirror the standards of review employed in anticipation and obviousness inquiries

*933 both anticipation under ¡± 102 and obviousness under ¡± 103 are two-step inquiries
oakley inc. v. sunglass hut int l 316_f.3d_1331 1339 fed.cir.2003 ; key pharms
v. hercon labs corp. 161_f.3d_709 714 fed.cir.1998
the first_step in both analyses is a proper construction of the claims which we review de novo
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 970-71 fed.cir.1995
the second step in the analyses requires a comparison of the properly construed claim to the prior_art
oakley 316 f.3d at 1339
in the context of an interference under ¡± 291 the two-way_test defines the available prior_art as including the allegedly interfering subject_matter
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.601 n
anticipation under ¡± 102 is a question of fact that we review for clear_error
electro med
sys. s.a. v. cooper life scis. 34_f.3d_1048 1052 fed.cir.1994
obviousness under ¡± 103 is a legal conclusion based on underlying factual_determinations
we review the legal conclusion de novo and the underlying factual_determinations for clear_error
oakley 316 f.3d at 1339

b
analysis
1
claim construction
claim 1 of the ¡¬827_patent includes the transition term` comprising'
medichem argues that this term is open-ended and that as a result additional material elements or method steps may be included in the claimed process
according to medichem the absence of a tertiary_amine in rolabos claims is therefore irrelevant
rolabos claim encompasses not only any improved processes for the manufacture of loratadine that do not include tertiary_amines but also because of the open-ended transition term processes like medichems that do include tertiary_amines
consequently medichem asserts the district_court misconstrued the subject_matter claimed by the ¡¬827_patent by reading the absence of a tertiary_amine_requirement as excluding tertiary_amines from the rolabo process
had it wanted to medichem continues rolabo could have drafted its claim to exclude the presence of tertiary_amines by using the transition phrase` consisting of' rather than` comprising'
rolabo does not dispute medichems argument regarding claim construction and in fact admitted its correctness during the district_court_proceedings

we agree with medichem in its urged construction
`` the transitioncomprising in a method claim indicates that the claim is open-ended and allows for additional_steps'
invitrogen corp. v. biocrest mfg. l.p. 327_f.3d_1364 1368 fed.cir.2003 citations omitted
in the course of its analysis the district_court apparently assumed that the absence of an affirmative claiming of tertiary_amines excluded them from its scope
see district_court_opinion slip op.at 9` [ t ] he test.. is whether someone reasonably skilled in the art would find the elimination of a tertiary_amine obvious or anticipated in light of the prior_art at the relevant time'
( emphasis added
the assumption that tertiary_amines were excluded from the claims of the ¡¬827_patent is consistent throughout the district_courts opinion
as drafted however the process described in the ¡¬827_patent includes not only the steps listed in the claim but also any additional_steps that may be added
invitrogen 327 f.3d at 1368
the addition of a tertiary_amine to the process described by the ¡¬827_patent is an indisputable possibility as demonstrated by both the ¡¬100_patent itself and rolabos concession at oral_argument
thus while the process described by claims 1_and_17 of the ¡¬827_patent does not require the presence of a tertiary *934 amine it certainly can not be read to exclude it.3

2
interference-in-fact analysis
`` [ i ] n order to provoke an interference in district_court under ¡± 291 the interfering patents must have the same or substantially the same_subject_matter in similar form as that required by the pto pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 135'
slip track sys. inc. v. metal-lite inc. 304_f.3d_1256 1263 fed.cir.2002
a district_court` has no jurisdiction under ¡± 291 unless interference is established'
albert v. kevex corp. 729_f.2d_757 760-61 fed.cir.1984
thus the first_step in any interference proceeding under ¡± 291 is the evaluation of whether an interference-in-fact exists under the two-way_test
though pto regulations do not bind a district_court a district_court defines` the same or substantially the same_subject_matter' in the same manner as would the pto under its own regulations-by using the two-way_test.4 see slip track 304 f.3d at 1263

according to the regulations outlining interference_proceedings in the pto` [ a ] n interference-in-fact exists when at least one claim of a party that is designated to correspond to a count and at least one claim of an opponent that is designated to correspond to the count define the same_patentable_invention'
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.601 j
the` same_patentable_invention' is defined by a separate subsection of the same regulation
id.¡± 1.601 n
this is referred to as the` two-way_test'
eli_lilly 334 f.3d at 1265
as has been explained by the board of patent_appeals & interferences the claimed invention of party_a is presumed to be prior_art vis-a-vis party_b and vice versa
the claimed invention of party_a must anticipate or render obvious the claimed invention of party_b and the claimed invention of party_b must anticipate or render obvious the claimed invention of party_a
winter v. fujita 53_uspq2d_1234 1243 1999_wl_1327616_(bd._pat.app._&_int.1999) ; see also eli_lilly 334 f.3d at 1269 endorsing an identical interpretation
as written section 1.601 n incorporates the standards for both anticipation under ¡± 102 and obviousness under ¡± 103 in determining the existence of an interference permitting either circumstance to satisfy that leg of the two-way_test

construed properly claims 1_and_2 of the ¡¬100_patent plainly anticipate claims 1_and_17 of the ¡¬827_patent when the ¡¬100_patent is the assumed prior_art under the two-way_test
rolabo appropriately conceded this point at oral_argument
`` it is.. an elementary principle of patent law that when as by a recitation of ranges or otherwise a claim covers several compositions the claim isanticipated if one of them is in the prior_art'
titanium metals corp. v. banner 778_f.2d_775 782 fed.cir.1985 citations and emphasis omitted
the broader claims of the ¡¬827_patent permit but do not require a tertiary_amine
the narrower_claims of the ¡¬100_patent are restricted to processes including a tertiary_amine
since the ¡¬100_patent teaches a process that falls within *935 the scope of the claims of the ¡¬ 827 patent claims 1_and_2 of the ¡¬100_patent when treated as prior_art anticipate claims 1_and_17 of the ¡¬827_patent
as a result we reverse the district_courts findings that the first_leg of the two-way_test was not satisfied

medichem further argues that the district_court found that the requirement of a tertiary_amine in the claims of the ¡¬100_patent would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art assuming the ¡¬827_patent was prior_art as required by the second_leg of the two-way interference_inquiry
we can affirm this finding medichem explains not only because of the minor differences between the ¡¬100 and ¡¬827_patent_s but also because the use of tertiary_amines in mcmurry_reactions was well known since the 1970s and was reported in a 1989 article by professor mcmurry himself
given the finding of anticipation of claims 1_and_17 of the ¡¬827_patent under the first_leg of the two-way_test and the purported obviousness finding of the district_court under the second_leg medichem concludes that the two-way_test is satisfied resulting in an interference-in-fact
we disagree with medichems reading of the district_court opinion

the district_court treated the ¡¬100_patent as prior_art in the first_leg of the two-way interference test
district_court_opinion slip op.at 9` [ i ] t would not be obvious that one could achieve a similar result without adding a tertiary_amine'
( emphasis added
as best we can tell the district_court did not move beyond this first_step of the inquiry
see id.at 13` what someone skilled in the art would not find obvious.. was what would be the result if tertiary_amine were eliminated from the process..'
finding one leg of the two-way_test not satisfied the district_court appropriately ended its inquiry-there can be no interference-in-fact without satisfaction of each leg of the two-way_test
as we have reversed the district_courts conclusion that the first_leg was not satisfied however continued analysis under the second_leg now becomes necessary

since the district_court made no findings of fact regarding the second_leg of the interference_inquiry it is impossible for this court in the first_instance to undertake any review
as the ¡¬827_patent contains genus claims and the ¡¬100_patent contains species claims an arrangement that assumes that the ¡¬827_patent is prior_art does not necessarily anticipate or make obvious the narrower_claims of the ¡¬100_patent
see eli_lilly 334 f.3d at 1270` [ e ] arlier disclosure of a genus does not necessarily prevent patenting a species member of the genus`
the second_leg of the two-way_test is satisfied however if either condition is met
anticipation is a question of fact
oakley 316 f.3d at 1339
although obviousness is a question of law it is based on underlying factual_determinations
id
accordingly we remand this portion of the interference_inquiry to the district_court to make factual_determinations of anticipation and obviousness in the first_instance

3
priority determination
the district_court determined that medichem established the priority of the ¡¬100_patent at trial
it did so however prior to engaging in the interference-in-fact analysis
this was an error
`` [ i ] nterference between patents is a sine qua non of an action under ¡± 291'
albert 729 f.2d at 760
without first identifying an interference-in-fact under the two-way_test a court has no jurisdiction to make a priority_determination between two patents under ¡± 291
id.at 760-61
this jurisdictional limitation on a courts power has significant import where as here the district_court ultimately finds no interference-in-fact
*936 while the district_court is free to reach the same conclusion on remand it may do so only once proper jurisdiction-an interference-in-fact-has been established
we accordingly vacate the district_courts priority_determination

c. effect of the board proceedings
as mentioned in the period between the conclusion of the district_court_proceedings and the commencement of proceedings in this court medichem initiated reissue proceedings before the board of patent_appeals and interferences
at the time of oral_argument the board had declared an interference-in-fact and following resolution of several pending motions from the parties was set to begin proceedings on the issue of priority
see stampa 2002_wl_31926813
-- -- 65 uspq2d at -- -- 2002 pat.app
lexis 191 at *17
we point out that on remand a stay of proceedings in the district_court pending the outcome of the parallel proceedings in the pto remains an option within the district_courts discretion
see slip track sys
v. metal lite 159_f.3d_1337 1341 fed.cir.1998

although proceedings in the pto under ¡± 135 and proceedings in a district_court under ¡± 291 are not identical they are closely related
the board has already declared an interference-in-fact
stampa 2002_wl_31926813 -- -- 65 uspq2d at -- -- 2002 pat.app
lexis 191 at *17
while the issues of interference before the board may as pointed out by the board itself differ from those in front of the district_court the boards resolution of the matter will certainly aid the district_court in subsequent proceedings
see fisher controls co. v. control components inc. 443_f.supp._581 582 s.d.iowa 1977
the record generated by the board particularly in light of the boards expertise in the matter may permit the district_court to avoid a needless duplication of efforts
furthermore a priority_determination that results in the cancellation of the interfering claims of the ¡¬100_patent would eliminate the need for further_proceedings in the district_court altogether
the discretion to stay proceedings pending the outcome of the pto proceedings remains available to the district_court and the district_court should in no way view our remand as suggesting otherwise

d. attorney fees
as there is no final resolution of the dispute in this case there is no` prevailing party' as is required for an award of attorney_fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
as such the district_courts decision not to award fees was premature and is accordingly vacated

iii
conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we reverse the district_courts finding that the first_leg of the two-way_test treating the ¡¬100_patent as prior_art was not satisfied vacate the district_courts priority_determination and decision not to award attorney_fees and remand with an order to stay further_proceedings pending the outcome of the interference_proceedings involving the ¡¬ 659 reissue
