opinion
rader circuit_judge
in the united_states_district_court for the district of new_jersey a jury found in favor of plaintiff-appellant princeton_biochemicals inc. princeton rejecting the claims of defendant-appellee beckman_coulter inc. beckman that princetons u.s. patent no._5045,172 the172_patent is invalid by reason of obviousness and prior_invention and finding that beckman infringed the172_patent
on all three *1334 questions however the district_court found the jurys verdict unsupported by substantial_evidence and granted judgment as a matter of law jmol in favor of beckman
princeton_biochemicals inc. v. beckman_coulter inc. no._96-5541 mlc 2004_wl_1398227 d.n.j
june 17 2004
because the district_court properly concluded that substantial_evidence did not support the jurys verdict of nonobviousness this court affirms

i. dr. norberto guzman is the inventor of the172_patent which he assigned to princeton
the172_patent claims a capillary_electrophoresis_device
electrophoresis is one method available for the investigation of biological materials and is an efficient procedure for the separation and detection of proteins and other matter
'172_patent col._1,_ll._16-20
electrophoretic separation one species of electrophoresis relies on the differential speeds of the migration of differently charged particles in an electric field
id.at col._1,_ll._21-23
capillary electrophoresis is one type of electrophoretic_separation
id.at col._1,_ll._17-20
as the172_patent describes [ i ] t is generally known that a material containing mixtures of substances to be analyzed can be passed along a capillary_tube and through a detector under the influence of an applied voltage
the applied voltage charges the substances and the charges on the substances determine their spacing and their speed of passage along the capillary_tube
id.at col._2,_ll._32-38
capillary tubes generally made of quartz range in lengths of roughly 10_to_100 centimeters and 25-200 microns in diameter
id.at col._1,_ll._50-58
due to the dimensions of a tube capillary_electrophoresis requires only a minute sample size to efficiently separate and identify the components of a solution

claim 32 of the172_patent claims a specific capillary_electrophoresis_device capillary electrophoresis apparatus comprising a capillary_tube of the type which can be electrically charged said capillary_tube having first and second_ends first means at said first_end of said capillary_tube providing a source of buffer_solution and a source of a sample_substance to be analyzed second_means coupled to said apparatus for applying electrical_potential across said capillary_tube whereby a sample flows through said capillary_tube and past said detector said first means includes a rotatable_table carrying a plurality of sample_cups and a holder for holding an end of said capillary_tube in operative_relation with one of the said cups said cups containing either buffer_solution or a sample to be analyzed and
said capillary_tube is in the form of a coil of glass_tubing [ secured to a support_member ]
*

id.at col._23,_ll._30-47 emphases added
the parties stipulated that claim 32 contains eight elements as follows

capillary electrophoresis apparatus comprising 1 a capillary_tube of the type which can be electrically charged 2 said capillary_tube having first and second_ends 3 first means at said first_end of said capillary_tube providing a source of buffer_solution and a source of sample_substance to be analyzed *1335 4 second_means coupled to said apparatus for applying electrical_potential across said capillary_tube whereby a sample flows through said capillary_tube and past said detector 5 said first means includes a rotatable_table carrying a plurality of sample_cups and
( 6 a holder for holding an end of said capillary_tube in operative_relation with one of the said cups said cups containing either buffer_solution or a sample to be analyzed and
( 7 said capillary_tube is in the form of a coil of glass_tubing
( 8 secured to a support_member

beckman manufactures and sells the p/ace 2000_and_5000 series capillary_electrophoresis_devices` the accused devices' or` the p/ace_devices'
beckman contends a prototype device named otep_ii contained all the elements recited in claim 32
princeton does not contest that beckman made otep_ii by february 1 1987
that date therefore is the relevant reduction-to-practice date for the p/ace_devices
beckman began selling p/ace_devices as early as 1993

guzman filed the application for the172_patent on november 14 1988
thus the critical date for evaluating 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b prior_art_references is november 14 1987
several references published before november 14 1987 discussed the electrophoretic concepts embodied in claim 32 of the172_patent
two particular references stand out
the first an article by honda dated september 1987 describes ways to introduce automatically different samples into a capillary_electrophoresis_device
susumu honda et
al.` evaluation of an automatic siphonic sampler for capillary zone electrophoresis' int l j. on chromatography electrophoresis and related methods
the second a ph.d. thesis by lukacs was published in 1983 by a graduate student of dr. james w. jorgenson an expert who testified on behalf of beckman
the lukacs_thesis discloses the coiling of capillary_tubes during electrophoretic work
coiling a capillary_tube lengthens the tubing without increasing the size of the electrophoretic_device
a longer tube provides better_separation and identification of analytes

on november 21 1996 princeton filed suit alleging that the p/ace_devices infringed claim 32 of the172_patent
beckman denied infringement and sought a declaration of invalidity on grounds of obviousness and prior_invention
following a grant of summary judgment of noninfringement princeton appealed
in an unpublished opinion this court reversed holding that the district_court had improperly construed the sixth element in claim 32
princeton_biochemicals inc. v. beckman instruments inc. 1999_wl_641233 at *6 fed.cir.1999` the proper interpretation of the holder limitation is thatin operative_relation encompasses both vertical_movement of the holder as well as vertical_movement of the sample_cups and the table
``

on remand the district_court conducted a nine-day trial followed by motions for jmol from both parties
the district_court reserved judgment until after the jury_verdict
the jury decided in favor of princeton on all issues
specifically the jury found that princeton proved by a preponderance of the evidence that beckmans devices infringed claim 32 of the172_patent ; that beckman did not prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claim 32 of the patent was invalid for obviousness ; and finally that beckman did not prove` by clear and convincing_evidence that claim 32 is invalid because the invention described in that claim was made by beckman before it was made by princeton'
*1336 beckman timely renewed its jmol motion and moved alternatively for a new_trial

in due course the district_court issued a carefully composed 194-page opinion that set aside the jurys verdict and found all counts in favor of beckman
princeton_biochemicals inc. 2004_wl_1398227
the district_court also granted beckmans motion for a new_trial
id.at *91
princeton timely appealed to this court
this court has jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
`` the grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is a procedural issue not unique to patent law reviewed under the law of the regional circuit in which the appeal from the district_court would usually lie'
summit tech. inc. v. nidek co. 363_f.3d_1219 1223 fed.cir.2004
under the law of the third circuit review of a district_courts ruling on jmol is plenary
shellenberger v. summit bancorp inc. 318_f.3d_183 186 3rd cir.2003
the party requesting the jmol must show that substantial_evidence did not support the jurys findings where substantial_evidence is` such relevant evidence from the record taken as a whole as might be accepted by a reasonable mind as adequate to support the finding under review'
tex instruments inc. v. cypress semiconductor corp. 90_f.3d_1558 1563 fed.cir.1996
this court must also consider all the evidence before the jury and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the prevailing party on that issue i.e. the non-movant
richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476 1479 fed.cir.1997
regarding the obviousness issue in this case this court must determine whether the jury had substantial_evidence upon which to conclude that beckman met its burden of showing invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence

this court also reviews the legal standards that the jury applied in reaching its verdict to determine whether they were correct as a matter of law
herbert markman positek inc. v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 975 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
when reviewing a jurys verdict on obviousness the court reviews the` conclusions on obviousness a question of law without deference and the underlying findings of fact whether explicit or implicit within the verdict for substantial_evidence'
lnp eng g plastics inc. v. miller waste mills inc. 275_f.3d_1347 1353 fed.cir.2001
specifically the jury is presumed to have` resolved the underlying factual disputes in favor of the verdict winner and [ this court leaves ] those presumed findings undisturbed if they are supported by substantial_evidence'
jurgens v. mckasy 927_f.2d_1552 1557 fed.cir.1991

iii
section 103 of title 35 of the united states code states a patent may not be obtained.. if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 2000
the legal conclusion that a claim is obvious within ¡± 103 a depends on at least four underlying factual issues 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art ; and 4 evaluation of any relevant secondary considerations
see *1337 graham v. john deere co. of kansas city 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
analyzing the record support for those factors for beckmans rule 50 b motion the trial court concluded that claim 32 was obvious
thus the court granted beckmans motion for jmol set aside the jury_verdict rejecting the obviousness challenge and entered judgment invalidating claim 32

there is no dispute that the references introduced at trial disclosed every element in claim 32
guzman admitted this in his testimony at trial
thus aside from the relevance of the asserted references the only disputed issue at trial and asserted on appeal was whether there was motivation to combine the elements already present in the prior_art
as this court outlined in ruiz v. a.b
chance co. 357_f.3d_1270 1275 fed.cir.2004 in making the assessment of differences between the prior_art and the claimed subject_matter section 103 specifically requires consideration of the claimed invention` as a whole'
inventions typically are new_combinations of existing principles or features
envtl designs ltd. v. union oil co. 713_f.2d_693 698 fed.cir.1983 noting that` virtually all [ inventions ] are combinations of old elements'
the` as a whole' instruction in title 35 prevents evaluation of the invention part by part
ruiz 357 f.3d at 1275
without this important requirement an obviousness assessment might successfully break an invention into its component parts then find a prior_art reference corresponding to each component
id
this line of reasoning would import hindsight into the obviousness determination by using the invention as a roadmap to find its prior_art components
further this improper method would discount the value of combining various existing features or principles in a new way to achieve a new result-often the essence of invention
id

contrary to this reasoning section 103 requires assessment of the invention as a whole
id
this` as a whole' assessment of the invention requires a showing that an artisan of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of invention confronted by the same_problems as the inventor and with no knowledge of the claimed invention would have selected the various elements from the prior_art and combined them in the claimed manner
id
in other_words section 103 requires some suggestion or motivation before the invention itself to make the new_combination
see in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1355-56 fed.cir.1998

in setting aside the jurys verdict and holding claim 32 obvious the district_court systematically and vigilantly considered the relevant prior_art_references and testimony of both parties
the honda_article relates to claim 32s first six elements and describes an automated capillary_electrophoresis_device with a rotatable_table carrying a plurality of sample_cups
princeton does not contest that the honda_article discloses elements one through six
therefore at the time of princetons claim 32 invention the prior_art had disclosed elements one through six

with respect to the seventh element the district_court found that the lukacs_thesis disclosed the construction and use of a coiled glass capillary in a capillary_electrophoresis apparatus
princeton_biochemicals inc. 2004_wl_1398227 at *40
additionally dr._jorgenson testified about ms._lukacss work with coiled capillaries based on his own observations in the laboratory with ms._lukacs
he noted that they coiled glass capillaries that were two to three meters and longer
id.at *24
in light of the lukacs_thesis dr._guzman conceded at trial that he was not the first to coil a capillary in an electrophoresis device
id.at *40
therefore at the time of princetons claim 32 invention element 7 was also known in the prior_art

element 8 of claim 32 recites the requirement that the capillary_tube of claim *1338 32 in the form of glass_tubing must be` secured to a support_member'
at trial dr._guzman testified that he did not invent` securing capillary_tubes or any portion thereof to support_members' and did not deny that this element was` old' or that it did not` add' anything new to the claim
from this the district_court correctly concluded that element 8 was known in the prior_art
id.at *40
furthermore in its brief to this court princeton conceded that elements one through eight were separately known in the prior_art

as discussed simply identifying all of the elements in a claim in the prior_art does not render a claim obvious
ruiz 357 f.3d at 1275
instead section 103 requires some suggestion or motivation in the prior_art to make the new_combination
rouffet 149 f.3d at 1355-56
a suggestion or motivation to modify prior_art teachings may appear in the content of the public prior_art in the nature of the problem addressed by the invention or even in the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art
sibia_neurosciences inc. v. cadus pharm corp. 225_f.3d_1349 1356 fed.cir.2000

dr._jorgenson testified that the motivation to combine these references was found in the knowledge of those skilled in the art at the time of guzmans invention
see sibia_neurosciences inc. 225 f.3d at 1356 stating that motivation suggestion or reason to combine items of prior_art may come from the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art
as jorgenson explained [ t ] he combination is obvious
every one of the individual ideas is obvious
and the combination is absolutely obvious
everybody in all of the related fields in all of the related technologies is doing those kinds of things..
the entire package taken together is obvious
id
princeton offered no evidence to rebut dr._jorgensons testimony

dr._jorgensons testimony on motivation to combine is unrebutted
moreover it is consistent with the prior_art introduced at trial
the only additions to the honda prior_art in this invention were coiling the capillaries lukacs prior_art and supporting the coils concededly prior_art
both of those simple additions appear in other prior_art_references
thus dr._jorgenson testified without any rebutting evidence in the record that the suggestion to coil and secure the capillaries in the honda device was within the knowledge of one of skill in the art
in in re lee this court expressed skepticism about invoking the knowledge of a skilled artisan to supply the motivation to combine on a scanty record
277_f.3d_1338 1343-44 fed.cir.2002` this factual question of motivation.. could not be resolved on subjective belief and unknown authority`
dr._jorgenson supplied detailed_analysis of the prior_art and the reasons that one of ordinary_skill would possess knowledge and motivation to combine these simple elements

in addition the nature of the problem supplies a motivation to combine these prior_art_references
the district_court provided a detailed_analysis of the nature of the problem solved by the invention
princeton_biochemicals inc. 2004_wl_1398227 at *37-40
the problem was lengthening and securing the capillaries on the honda automatic device to produce better_separation
id.at *38
the prior_art lukacs_thesis stated that lengthening was precisely the reason for coiling
id.at *39
with regard to securing dr._osborne a beckman witness testified about the problem of a capillary_electrophoresis_device whose capillary swayed during use and affected the separation result
id
dr._osborne observed` [ w ] e did not want the capillary to move during the separation'
*1339 id
in other_words the nature of the problem called for exactly the solutions in the prior_art
moreover the nature of the problem as noted again in dr._jorgensons testimony called for the combination
dr._jorgenson observed that the problem called for coiled electrophoresis tubes including capillary_tubes secured in place in a variety of ways
id
he also testified that one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention would know to coil a capillary to save space
id
regarding the securing of a capillary_tube to a support_member dr._jorgenson also testified that it would be obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art to do so as` you do n't want a coil floating around without some kind of support'
id
thus the nature of the problem also supplies a motivation to make this combination of closely related prior_art elements

the district_court also properly found that the references for this obviousness analysis were proper prior_art
a reference is appropriate prior_art if within the field of the inventors endeavor
bausch & lomb inc. v. barnes-hind/hydrocurve inc. 796_f.2d_443 449 fed.cir.1986
alternatively a reference qualifies as prior_art if` reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor was involved'
id
`` a reference is reasonably pertinent if even though it may be in a different field of endeavor it is one which because of the matter with which it deals logically would have commended itself to an inventors attention in considering his problem'
in re gpac inc. 57_f.3d_1573 1578 fed.cir.1995 quotations and citations omitted
if a references disclosure relates to the same problem as the claimed invention` that fact supports use of that reference in an obviousness rejection'
in re clay 966_f.2d_656 659 fed.cir.1992

in this case all the references for obviousness constitute analogous art even though some of the references fall within the related field of liquid_chromatography
throughout the prosecution history of the172_patent the examiner consistently rejected elements one through six of claim 32 as obvious citing references ranging from capillary_electrophoresis to liquid_chromatography-a related means of separating analytes
the examiner stated on the record` [ l ] iquid chromatography and capillary_electrophoresis are closely related techniques'
the district_court also itemized other references in the chemical separations field describing the relation to electrophoretic_separation or chromatography or both
princeton_biochemicals inc. 2004_wl_1398227 at *36-37
the district_court further established that capillary_electrophoresis is closely related to the types of electrophoreses described in some of the references
id.at *37
finally dr._jorgenson offered expert testimony that one of ordinary_skill in the art would look to these related fields to solve problems in the field of capillary_electrophoresis
id.at *37

the district_court also examined whether the prior_art_references were reasonably pertinent to the particular problems with which the invention of claim 32 was involved
id.at *37-39
in defining such problems the district_court looked to dr._guzmans own testimony that the electrophoretic_device needed to be compact and immobile
id.at *38
as already noted the district_court properly assessed that the prior_art_references addressed those same_problems in the same way
id.at *39
in sum the district_court used proper prior_art_references in its correct obviousness analysis

viewing the evidence as a whole and in a light most favorable to princeton this court agrees with the district_court that there was not substantial_evidence to support the jury_verdict
because claim 32 is *1340 invalid for obviousness this court need not reach the issues of prior_invention and infringement

costs
each party shall bear its own costs
