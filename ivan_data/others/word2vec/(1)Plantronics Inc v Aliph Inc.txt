background
the ¡¬453_patent is directed to a concha-style_headset for transmitting received sounds to the ear of a user e.g. headsets used with cell_phone_receivers
¡¬453_patent_col. 1_ll._13 -16
in particular the patent discloses an apparatus for stabilizing a concha_style_headset during use
id
col. 2_ll._56 -63
because the claimed apparatus requires some familiarity with the human ear an illustration is provided below

id
fig._3
of particular relevance is the concha` a deep cavity containing the entry to the ear_canal' and which is divided into the upper and lower_concha 43_and_41
¡¬453_patent_col. 4_ll._50 -52
prior art headset stabilizers included large supports outside the ear or relied on appendages to hook onto the crux of the helix 31
id
col. 1_ll._20 -55
the ¡¬453_patent purports to improve upon prior_art headset stabilizers
in particular the claimed headset consists of` a receiver_attachment that couples to the body of the receiver a support_member extending from the receiver_attachment and a concha_stabilizer_pad coupled to the end of the support_member such that the concha_stabilizer_pad contacts the upper_concha under the antihelix of the ear with the receiver placed in the lower_concha in front of the ear_canal'
id.at [ 57 ]
thus the concha_stabilizer_pad has three points of contact the tragus the anti-tragus and the upper_concha

on january 15 2009 plantronics filed the underlying patent infringement suit against aliph originally asserting claims 1 7 10_and_11
subsequently on november 9 2009 aliph requested ex parte reexamination by the u.s. patent and trademark office` pto' of the asserted claims which the pto granted
as a result the district_court litigation was stayed
in its request for reexamination aliph argued that the asserted claims were invalid as anticipated and obvious in view of four prior_art_references 1 u.s._patent_no._1753,817 to aber` aber' ; 2 u.s._patent_no._1893,143 to koch` koch' ; 3 u.s. patent no._4720,857 to burris et al
(` burris' ; and 4 japanese application publication no
jp58-104077 to watanabe` watanabe'
on march_1,_2011 the pto issued a reexamination certificate confirming the patentability of the challenged claims along with the addition of dependent_claims 16-56
plantronics thereafter amended its infringement contentions to assert new claims 18 20-21 25-26 and 28-56 in addition to the originally asserted claims 1 7 10 and 11 collectively` asserted claims'

on september 19 2011 the district_court issued a tentative claim_construction order and held its markman hearing on september 21 2011
on october 6 2011 the district_court issued its claim_construction order construing in relevant_part the terms` stabilizer_support_member' in claim 1 and` concha_stabilizer' in claim 10

oct._6,_2011
on march_23,_2012 the district_court granted summary_judgment holding the asserted claims were invalid and not infringed

in its summary_judgment_decision the district_court provided further construction of a` stabilizer_support_member' and` concha_stabilizer' and in turn found no infringement of claims 1_and_10
likewise the district_court held claims 1 7 10 11 18 20 21 26 28 30 43_and_44 of the ¡¬453_patent were invalid as obvious in light of the combination of u.s._patent_no._1893,474` lieber' with japanese utility patent application no._60-40187 u` komoda'
furthermore the district_court determined that dependent_claims 25 29 31-big_token__42_and_45__big_token -56 were obvious by the combination of the lieber patent the komoda patent and u.s._patent_no._5048,090` geers'

discussion
plantronics raises the following issues 1 whether the district_court improperly construed the terms` stabilizer_support_member' in claim 1 and` concha_stabilizer' in claim 10 ; 2 whether the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment of noninfringement ; and 3 whether the district_court erred in granting aliphs motion for summary_judgment of obviousness
these issues are addressed seriatim

the district_court erred in construing the terms` stabilizer support member' and` concha stabilizer' when it limited them to` elongated' structures
we review a district_courts claim_construction de novo
cybor corp. v. fas *1349 techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454-55 fed.cir.1998 en banc
to ascertain the scope and meaning of the asserted claims we look to the words of the claims themselves the specification the prosecution_history and if necessary any relevant extrinsic evidence

the district_court construed` stabilizer_support_member' as` an elongated structure that extends from the ear_cushion to the concha_stabilizer_pad and stabilizes the headset' and construed` concha_stabilizer' as` an elongated stabilizing structure which extends between the ear_cushion and the upper_concha'
summ
j
decision 2012_wl_994636 at *3
in its summary_judgment_decision the district_court clarified the meaning of` elongated' as` longer than it is wide'
id
thus the district_court placed a narrowing structural limitation to the claims with its construction of` elongated' to mean` longer than it is wide'

plantronics contends that the district_courts construction improperly imported a limitation to the claims from the specification and proposes that these terms require a structure that simply` extends from something else'
aliph on the other hand agrees with the district_courts construction
aliph argues that because plantronics during prosecution elected a species of the invention that is limited to` elongated' structures a` stabilizer_support_member' and a` concha_stabilizer' must be` elongated' and that` elongated' means` longer than it is wide'
upon review of the claim_language the specification and the prosecution_history of the ¡¬453_patent the district_courts construction limiting the` stabilizer_support' and` concha_stabilizer' to a structure that is` elongated' and` longer than it is wide' is reversed
those terms require a meaning that is not as limiting as the district_court imposed

the asserted claims are drafted broadly without bounds to any particular_structure
specifically claim 1 recites a` stabilizer_support' as` dimensioned to fit within an upper_concha with the ear_cushion coupled to the receiver [ which is ] disposed between the tragus and the anti-tragus'
¡¬453_patent_col. 5_ll._17 -20
in addition claim 10 recites a` concha_stabilizer.. coupled to the ear_cushion and dimensioned to contact an upper_concha between an antihelix and a crux of a helix with the receiver disposed between the tragus and the anti-tragus..' ¡¬453_patent_col. 6_ll._12 -15
thus while the claims are instructive as to the general dimensions of a` stabilizer_support' and a` concha_stabilizer' they do not require any particular_structure e.g. one that is longer than it is wide
phillips 415 f.3d at 1312-13 providing for a presumption that claim_terms are to be given their ordinary and customary_meaning

like the claim_language the specification of the ¡¬453_patent does not limit the claimed apparatus to any particular_structure
aliph claims support in a portion of the specification referring to the` stabilizer_support' as a member that is` elongated'
¡¬453_patent_col. 2_l._14
in the very next paragraph however the` stabilizer_support' is described alternatively as an` arch' or a` torus' ringshaped structure
id
col. 2 ll.19-29
hence limiting the` stabilizing support_member' and` concha_stabilizer' to an` elongated' structure that is` longer than it is wide' would improperly limit the broadly drafted claims to one preferred_embodiment thereby excluding *1350 others or would be the result of improperly importing a limitation from the specification into the claims
kara tech inc. v. stamps.com inc. 582_f.3d_1341 1348 fed.cir.2009` the patentee is entitled to the full_scope of his claims and we will not limit him to his preferred_embodiment or import a limitation from the specification into the claims
``

contrary to aliphs argument the prosecution_history of the ¡¬453_patent does not salvage its position
specifically aliph argues that the prosecution_history makes clear that the stabilizer elements are` elongated' structures
aliph bases its contention on the pto-initiated restriction_requirement during prosecution in which plantronics was instructed to elect among what the pto viewed as multiple inventions
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 121` if two or more independent and distinct_inventions are claimed in one application the director may require the application to be restricted to one of the inventions`
plantronics abandoned that application and subsequently filed a second similar patent application
the pto again issued a restriction_requirement finding four patentably distinct_inventions in 1 figures_1a/1b ; 2 figure 2a ; 3 figure 2b ; and 4 figure 2c
accordingly the pto directed plantronics to elect` a single disclosed species for prosecution on the merits to which the claims shall be restricted if no generic_claim is finally held to be allowable'
j.a
380
the pto also concluded that the application presented no` generic_claim' covering more than a single species of the invention
in response plantronics` elect [ ed ] without traverse to prosecute' only the` species of figures 1a and 1b'
j.a
384
plantronics indicated that` [ c ] laims 1-big_token__6_and_9__big_token -12 read on the elected species..
claim 11 is generic'
id
this application was eventually issued as the ¡¬453_patent on january 27 1998
because plantronics elected to prosecute the species of figures_1a and 1b aliph proposes that the asserted claims must be limited to the disclosures and embodiments pertaining to figures_1a and 1b-effectively carving out disclosures related to the arch-shaped and torus-shaped structures of the` stabilizing support' and limiting the` stabilizing support' to disclosures describing an` elongated' structure
in other_words aliph avers that the claims should be limited to the single invention depicting a single_embodiment having one` elongated' structure as plantronics elected to pursue

`` [ p ] rosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim_language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution making the claim_scope narrower than it would otherwise be'
phillips 415 f.3d at 1317
when narrowing claim_scope as here this court has recognized that a` clear and unmistakable' disavowal during prosecution overcomes the`heavy_presumption that claim_terms carry their full ordinary and customary_meaning'
omega_eng g inc. v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1323 1326 fed.cir.2003 ; see also epistar corp. v. int l trade comm n 566_f.3d_1321 1334 fed.cir.2009` a heavy_presumption exists that claim_terms carry their full ordinary and customary_meaning unless [ a party ] can show the patentee expressly relinquished claim_scope`
thus when the patentee unequivocally and unambiguously disavows a certain meaning to obtain a patent the doctrine of prosecution_history disclaimer narrows the meaning of the claim consistent with the scope of the claim surrendered
*1351 phillips 415 f.3d at 1317
plantronics election of species of figures_1a and 1b did not amount to such a surrender of claim_scope

the ptos restriction_requirement did not suggest that the different_inventions it found were based on differences in structure i.e.` elongated' versus an` arch'
indeed the pto found four patentably distinct_inventions in the figures of the ¡¬453_patent without providing any reasons why in its view the application presented differing inventions
likewise other figures of the ¡¬453_patent depicting other unelected species of the invention also reveal a` stabilizer_support' that appears` elongated' which refutes aliphs contention that the restriction_requirement was based on that structural difference
the election of an invention in response to an ambiguous restriction_requirement in turn can not be said to provide any guidance forming a basis for narrowing a broadly drafted claim
omega_eng g 334 f.3d at 1325 we have` consistently rejected prosecution statements too vague or ambiguous to qualify as a disavowal of claim_scope`
neither the pto nor plantronics made any particular remarks regarding the differences e.g. in structure of what the pto found to be different_inventions and while plantronics elected without traverse the invention of figures_1a and 1b plantronics did disagree with the ptos comments on claim 11 when it responded that claim 11 is a generic_claim that read on all the embodiments illustrated in the application
this exchange with the pto thus does not amount to anything clear or unambiguous to disclaim claim_scope otherwise encompassed by the broadly drafted claims

even without the election aliph contends each of the species of invention both elected and unelected illustrates stabilizer members that are` elongated'
`` patent drawings [ however ] do not define the precise proportions of the elements and may not be relied on to show particular sizes if the specification is completely silent on the issue'
hockerson-halberstadt inc. v. avia grp
int l inc. 222_f.3d_951 956 fed.cir.2000 ; see also in re wright 569_f.2d_1124 1127 c.c.p.a.1977` absent any written description in the specification of quantitative values arguments based on measurement of a drawing are of little value
`` ; manual of patent examining procedure 2125` proportions of features in a drawing are not evidence of actual proportions when drawings are not to scale`
because the figures in the ¡¬453_patent do not evidence actual dimensions of the` stabilizer_support' and the` concha_stabilizer' they can not be relied upon to argue that the disputed terms should be limited to a particular_structure

aliph cites lg_electronics inc. v. bizcom electronics inc. 453_f.3d_1364 1378 fed.cir.2006 revd on other grounds by quanta computer inc. v. lg_electronics inc. 553_u.s._617 128_s.ct._2109 170_l.ed.2d_996_(2008) and acco_brands inc. v. micro security devices inc. 346_f.3d_1075 1079 fed.cir.2003 for support ; these cases are distinguishable
in both cases during claim_construction the district_court considered the patentees election of an invention in response to a pto restriction_requirement
in lg_electronics the defendants proposed a narrowing construction of a disputed claim term arguing that the patentee disavowed the use of` valid/invalid_bits' by pointing to portions of the specification that contemplated never using` valid/invalid_bits'
453 f.3d at 1377
we held that 1 the claims were drafted broadly without consideration of using or not using` valid/invalid bit' ; 2 the specification disclosed varying *1352 embodiments including those that used and did not use` valid/invalid_bits' and limiting the claims to any one of these embodiments would be improper ; and 3 even though the specification disclosed embodiments that never used` valid/invalid_bits' defendant can not point to those disclosures to show disavowal because they were directed to unelected portions of the invention
id.at 1377
in acco_brands after holding that the patentee disclaimed claim_scope during reexamination we determined that embodiments containing the disclaimed limitation were only relevant to other unelected portions of the specification which were claimed in other related patents and could not be used to recapture and broaden claim_scope that was disclaimed during reexamination
id.at 1079

this case differs from lg_electronics and acco_brands
the ptos restriction_requirement here did not clearly demarcate the actual differences among the species of inventions as was done in lg_electronics and acco_brands
regarding the restriction_requirement imposed in lg_electronics the pto required the patentee to elect one of two identified inventions in the application and the limitation at issue never using` valid/invalid_bits' was found to be relevant only as to the first unelected invention and not to the second elected invention
453 f.3d at 1378
in acco_brands it was also made clear that certain embodiments were claimed in other patents and that the patent at issue was directed to one particular figure/embodiment
346 f.3d at 1079

as discussed the pto here found four patentably distinct_inventions in the figures of the ¡¬453_patent without providing any reasons why these figures represented differing species
we can not discern from the correspondence between the pto and plantronics whether the` stabilizer_support_member' and the` concha_stabilizer' were interpreted by any party to contain particular structural limitations
given these ambiguities there is no basis to limit the broadly drafted claims at issue.1

the` stabilizer_support_member' and the` concha_stabilizer' are not structurally limited either in claim_language or in their corresponding description in the specification
likewise the election of species pertaining to figures_1a and 1b in response to the restriction_requirement does not narrow the claim_scope because the election was made without any indication that the` stabilizer_support' and the` concha_stabilizer' to one that is` longer than [ they are ] wide'
because the patent supports broader constructions the` stabilizer_support_member' is construed to mean` a structure that extends from the ear_cushion to the concha_stabilizer_pad and stabilizes the headset' and` concha_stabilizer' is construed to mean` a stabilizing structure dimensioned to extend between the ear_cushion and the upper_concha'
since the district_courts claim_construction is reversed its finding of no infringement is *1353 vacated and the issue is remanded for further_proceedings

the district_court failed to give proper consideration to objective evidence of nonobviousness and therefore erred in granting aliphs motion for summary judgment of obviousness
this court reviews a district_courts grant of summary_judgment without deference
osram sylvania inc. v. am
induction techs. inc. 701_f.3d_698 704 fed.cir.2012

the burden of proof lies with the challenger and this court has rejected any formal burden-shifting framework in evaluating the four graham factors
osram 701 f.3d at 709
thus the inquiry on summary_judgment is whether a jury applying the clear and convincing evidence standard could reasonably find based on the evidence produced by the accused infringer that the claimed invention was obvious
see trimed inc. v. stryker corp. 608_f.3d_1333 1339-40 fed.cir.2010

the gravamen of the parties dispute here involved whether a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine certain prior_art_references an issue that focuses heavily on the first and third graham factors

( citation and quotation marks omitted
the district_court found that lieber and komoda disclosed` a receiver ear_cushion stabilizer_support and pad' and that any gap between these prior *1354 art elements and those recited in relevant_part claims 1_and_11 of the ¡¬453_patent was bridged by` common_sense'
in particular the district_court determined that 1 the need for a stabilizing member that worked with the anatomy of an ear was a problem known in the art at the time of the invention 2 there was a trend towards miniaturization of in-the-ear devices and 3 miniaturizing the receiver described in lieber and komoda while pairing the receiver with a comfortable adaptable and stabilizing ear_cushion as claimed in the ¡¬453_patent was a matter of common_sense for those skilled in the art at the time of the invention

ksr 550 u.s. at 420 127_s.ct._1727
therefore motivation to combine may be found explicitly or implicitly in market forces ; design incentives ; the` interrelated teachings of multiple patents' ;` any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent' ; and the background knowledge creativity and common_sense of the person of ordinary_skill

although the obviousness analysis is somewhat flexible a district_courts conclusions with respect to obviousness must find support in the record

mintz v. dietz & watson 679_f.3d_1372 1377 fed.cir.2012
thus we have required that [ obviousness findings ] grounded in` common_sense' must contain explicit and clear reasoning providing some rational_underpinning why common_sense compels a finding of obviousness
see ksr 550 u.s. at 418 127_s.ct._1727 ; in re kahn 441_f.3d_977 988 fed.cir.2006` rejections on obviousness grounds can not be sustained by mere conclusory statements ; instead there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational_underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness`
in re nouvel 493_fed.appx._85 92 fed.cir.2012
where as here the necessary reasoning is absent we can not simply assume that` an ordinary artisan would be awakened to modify prior_art in such a way as to lead to an obviousness rejection'

it is in such circumstances moreover that it is especially important to guard against the dangers of hindsight_bias

as a safeguard against` slipping into use of hindsight and to resist the temptation to read into the prior_art the teachings of the invention in issue' we have required courts to consider evidence of the objective *1355 indicia of nonobviousness prior to making the ultimate determination of whether an invention is obvious
graham 383 u.s. at 36 86_s.ct._684 ; stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538 fed.cir.1983 objective_considerations` may often be the most probative and cogent evidence [ of nonobviousness ] in the record'
failure to give proper consideration to such evidence as in this case can be fatal because` common_sense' may not be so apparent in view of objective_evidence of nonobviousness e.g. commercial_success and copying particularly when all reasonable_inferences are drawn in favor of the patentee
see transocean offshore deepwater drilling inc. v. maersk contractors usa inc. 617_f.3d_1296 1305 fed.cir.2010 reversing for failure to consider the objective_evidence of nonobviousness and because there are genuine_issues of material_fact remaining as to objective_considerations

here the district_court concluded that the ¡¬453_patent was invalid as obvious before considering objective_indicia of nonobviousness
according to the district_court` [ i ] t would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art to modify the lieber device to reduce the size of the in-the-ear receiver while pairing the receiver with a comfortable adaptable ear_cushion that stabilized the device with a flexible_support_member that invoked the ear anatomy to avoid the use of headsets and earhooks'

the district_court addressed plantronics objective_evidence of nonobviousness-including copying and commercial_success-only after reaching this conclusion
it stated` even accepting as true plantronics assertions on these secondary_considerations they do not save plantronics from summary_judgment here since such secondary_considerations simply can not overcome a strong prima facie case of obviousness'
id
to the extent the district_court conducted a post hoc analysis of objective_considerations it was improper

this court has consistently pronounced that all evidence pertaining to the objective_indicia of nonobviousness must be considered before reaching an obviousness conclusion
see e.g. in re cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsule patent litig. 676_f.3d_1063 1076 fed.cir.2012
the significance of this fourth graham factor can not be overlooked or be relegated to` secondary status'
see id.at 1079
as we explained the objective_considerations when considered with the balance of the obviousness evidence in the record guard as a check against hindsight_bias..
in other_words knowing that the inventor succeeded in making the patented_invention a fact_finder might develop a hunch that the claimed invention was obvious and then construct a selective version of the facts that confirms that hunch
this is precisely why the supreme_court explained that objective_considerations might prevent a fact_finder from falling into such a trap observing that objective_considerations might serve to resist the temptation to read into the prior_art the teachings of the invention in issue
and it is precisely why fact_finders must withhold judgment on an obviousness challenge until it considers all relevant evidence including that relating to the objective_considerations

*1356 plantronics contends that it presented evidence of copying and commercial_success that at least raise genuine_issues of material_fact underlying the ultimate conclusion of obviousness
for example plantronics argues that the design of aliphs accused product began with plantronics concha-style_headset stabilizer that it is undisputed that aliph initially installed plantronics stabilizer into aliphs headset and from there that aliph copied plantronics design
plantronics also avers that it presented evidence that the functional fit provided by the copied design is critical to aliphs headset establishing a nexus between the secondary evidence and the claimed invention
with the copied design plantronics argues that aliph enjoyed commercial_success
in response aliph contends that the evidence plantronics presented was not sufficient but otherwise does little to rebut the evidence
the district_courts scant consideration of relevant objective_evidence belies aliphs argument

the full extent of the district_courts analysis was as follows` in support of these secondary_considerations plantronics relies in part upon the supplemental report of its expert barry katz
consistent with the evidentiary rulings above i did not rely on this supplemental unsworn expert report'

the district_court also stated` i did not find plantronics evidence of secondary_considerations to the extent it was not in expert reports i did not consider particularly persuasive
for example i found nothing helpful in the drysdale testimony..' id.at *big_token__11_n._12__big_token
these statements alone fail to provide any meaningful analysis for this courts review
nevertheless aliph asks that we reject plantronics objective_considerations by finding in the first instance that plantronics evidence is not tied adequately to the full_scope of the asserted claims
this argument is without merit because` [ i ] t is not our role to scour the record and search for something to justify a lower_courts conclusions particularly at the summary_judgment stage'

the district_courts opinion lacked such findings and reasoning

moreover we can not discern whether the district_court in this summary_judgment context drew all justifiable inferences in favor of plantronics and found no disputed issues of material_fact to support its holding with respect to obviousness
transocean 617 f.3d at 1305 stressing that a court must draw all reasonable_inferences in favor of a patent owner with respect to objective_evidence of nonobviousness in the context of a motion for summary_judgment of obviousness
in fact when all of the factual disputes regarding the objective_evidence are resolved in favor of plantronics we can not hold that the claims would have been obvious as a matter of law

`` ; see also simmons fastener corp. v. ill. tool works inc. 739_f.2d_1573 1576 fed.cir.1984 reversing the lower_court in part because evidence of objective_considerations *1357 particularly commercial_success was extremely strong and entitled to great weight
the commercial_success of aliphs alleged copied product and the failure of attempts to combine the prior_art elements before the ¡¬453_patent provide a genuine_issue of material_fact as to whether it would be` common_sense' to combine the elements in the prior_art to arrive at the claimed invention
because evidence pertaining to objective_considerations raises genuine_issues of material_fact the district_courts decision is reversed as to all the asserted claims in this case.3

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons the district_courts decision is vacated in part reversed in part and remanded for further_proceedings
to the extent the parties raise arguments based on issues the district_court denied on summary_judgment we decline to address them here
see m. eagles tool warehouse inc. v. fisher tooling co. 439_f.3d_1335 1344 fed.cir.2006` denials of summary_judgment are ordinarily not appealable and we will not decide the issue of invalidity here`
furthermore we have considered all other remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit

accordingly to the extent the district_courts final judgment invalidates patent claims not at issue that determination is vacated
