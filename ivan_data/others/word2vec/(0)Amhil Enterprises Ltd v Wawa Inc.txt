amhil_enters ltd. v. wawa_inc. 34_uspq2d_1640 1994_wl_750535_(d.md.1994) [ hereinafter amhil i ] ; amhil_enters ltd. v. wawa_inc. 34_uspq2d_1645 1995_wl_131296 d.md.1995 [ hereinafter amhil_ii ]
in amhil i the district_court granted defendant ivonis mazzarolos mazzarolos motion to dismiss the complaint as to him for lack of personal_jurisdiction
in amhil_ii the court granted defendant m & n_plastics inc.s m & ns motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement of amhils u.s._patent_no._4421,244244_patent both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents
amhil had previously dismissed its infringement claim against the other defendant wawa inc. d/b/a wawa_food_market wawa by stipulation and order dated 4_march_1994
in that same stipulation m & n conceded that it was properly before the district_court
we affirm amhil_ii and do not reach amhil i which is mooted by our affirmance of amhil_ii

i
background
amhil a canadian corporation is the assignee of the244_patent which is entitled` plastic lids for containers' and which lists hubert van melle as the inventor
figs
1 3 and 4 of the244_patent are reproduced below as figures 1 2 and 3 respectively

?
-- -- - the patent describes a thin flexible plastic container lid used for example in convenience stores and fast-food establishments to cover beverage containers
the patent professes that the lids are an improvement over prior_lids because in manufacture they facilitate fabrication by improving the strip ability from the mold in shipping and storage they require a smaller volume than prior_lids *1557 required and in use they have enhanced rim-gripping ability for a secure hold

amhil filed suit against three defendants alleging infringement of its244_patent wawa m & n and mazzarolo
wawa a new jersey corporation is primarily a middle atlantic regional convenience store chain with several stores located in maryland
wawa was providing one type of allegedly infringing cup_lids to its customers to cover beverages purchased in wawa stores
m & n a florida corporation manufactures the allegedly infringing cup_lids used by wawa
two partial cross-sectional drawings of m & n accused lids are depicted below in figure 4
mazzarolo is a canadian citizen who resides in vaudreuil quebec canada
he is a majority shareholder 75 % the only officer and the sole director of m & n ; the` m' in m & n stands for mazzarolo

?

amhil has appealed the judgment dismissing mazzarolo amhil i and the no-literal-infringement portion of the summary_judgment of noninfringement by the only remaining defendant after the dismissal m & n amhil_ii

amhil_ii summary judgment of noninfringement
a
standard of review
we first determine whether the district_court properly granted m & ns motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement
summary_judgment is appropriate when` the pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories and admissions on file together with the affidavits if any show that there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law'

a district_court should approach a motion for summary_judgment on the fact issue of infringement with great care
palumbo v. don-joy co. 762_f.2d_969 974 226_uspq_5 7 fed.cir.1985 overruled on other grounds by markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 976-79 34_uspq2d_1321 1327-29 fed.cir
( in banc cert
granted 515_u.s._1192 116_s.ct._40 132_l.ed.2d_921_(1995)
summary_judgment may however properly be decided as a matter of law when no genuine_issue of material_fact exists and no expert testimony *1558 is required to explain the nature of the patented invention or the accused product or to assist in their comparison
see e.g. sanitary refrigerator co. v. winters 280_u.s._30 36 50_s.ct._9 10-11 74_l.ed._147 3_uspq_40 42 1929 ; singer mfg co. v. cramer 192_u.s._265 275 24_s.ct._291 295 48_l.ed._437_(1904)

district courts decision
the district_court granted without a hearing m & ns motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement
in its motion m & n asserted that the244_patent did not cover its lids because the accused lids do not have a` cavity' that opens` downwardly and inwardly' or` outwardly extending projections' each having a` substantially vertical_face' with` substantially vertical_side_edges' and` substantially vertical_side_walls'

the district_court properly applied a two-step infringement analysis it first construed independent claim 1 and then decided whether claim 1 when properly construed covered the accused m & n_lids
see markman 52 f.3d at 976 34 uspq2d at 1326 citations omitted
according to amhil the district_court misconstrued the claim misapplied the misinterpreted claim disregarded evidence before it and improperly drew inferences in favor of m & n the moving party

as to the district_courts claim_construction amhil first asserts that the district_court improperly restricted the scope of the claims in suit making an erroneous` inside fit' distinction
amhil next asserts that the patented lids are used for both hot and cold cups and there is no hot/cold distinction in the patent or in the claims at issue as found by the district_court
thus according to amhil the district_court improperly limited the claims to` cold' cups
third amhil argues that the district_court improperly found that the patented lids lack flexibility which is contrary to the specification and claims
fourth amhil contends that the district_court erroneously interpreted the` substantially vertical' limitation to mean vertical per se
finally amhil asserts that the district_court improperly limited the claims to a particular shape

in support of the district_court m & n argues that the` outwardly extending projections' of the accused lids do not have a` substantially vertical_face with substantially vertical_side_edges and substantially vertical_side_walls'
m & n further argues that the accused lids do not have a cavity that opens` downwardly and inwardly' as required by claim 1
finally m & n contends that the district correctly concluded that m & n does not infringe either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents

c. claim construction
`` because claim_construction is a matter of law the construction given the claims is reviewed de novo on appeal'
markman 52 f.3d at 979 34 uspq2d at 1329
claim 1 the only independent claim in the244_patent and the only claim at issue here amhil_ii 34 uspq2d at 1647 reads as follows material in parentheses and brackets added emphasis added to contested language 1
a lid 10 for containers 12 made of thin flexible plastic for mounting on and receiving the bead 14 of a container 12 comprising a central_panel 16 ; a cavity 20 extending around the periphery of the lid 10 and opening downwardly and inwardly to receive the bead 14 of a container 12 to which said lid 10 is fitted ; means 22,24 connecting said cavity 20 to said central_panel 16 ; a skirt_portion 26 extending downwardly from said cavity 20 ; said skirt_portion 26 having a plurality of outwardly extending projections 28 each having a substantially vertical_face 1001 with substantially vertical_side_edges 102 and substantially vertical_side_walls 30 extending inwardly from said face 100 ;

the portions 32 of said skirt 26 that are between said outwardly extending projections *1559 28 extending inwardly to a waist_portion 34 having [ sic having ] a plurality of interruptions 104 one at each projection 28 and forming an undercut defining said cavity 20 in said waist_portion 34 [ sic said lid 10 ] ; said outwardly extending projections 28 and said waist_portion 34 [ sic said portions 32 -see col._4,_ll._33-36 and figures 1-3 above ] all terminating in their lower extremities at a downwardly and outwardly sloped lower band portion 36 ; and said outwardly extending projections 28 terminating in their upper extremities at a respective upper band portion 42 extending inwardly and upwardly from the upper edge [ edge between each portion 42 and projection 28 ] of each said respective vertical_face 100 and terminating at said cavity 20 in an upper undercut 44 which is higher and less inwardly extending than the undercut of said waist_portion 34 and which defines the peripheral_cavity [ part of entire cavity 20 ] over said outwardly extending projections 28
m & n and amhil focus their claim_construction arguments on two primary issues 1 whether the` cavity' compare element 20 in figures 2_and_3 above which are figures from the244_patent with element 20 in figure 4 above which depicts the accused m & n_lid of the accused lids opens` downwardly and inwardly' as required by the third paragraph of claim 1 and
( 2 whether the` outwardly extending projections' of the accused lids have` substantially vertical' faces compare element 100 in figures 1-3 above which are figures from the244_patent with element 100 in figure 4 and the portion labeled` face' in figure 8 below which depict the accused m & n_lid side_edges and side_walls as required by the sixth_paragraph of claim 1
looking at issue 2 we note that the sixth_paragraph of claim 1 requires the skirt_portion to comprise a plurality of` outwardly extending projections' each having a` substantially vertical_face' with` substantially vertical_side_edges' and` substantially vertical_side_walls'
it is clear from the specification that the adverb` outwardly' means in a direction from inside the container to outside the container and perpendicular to the containers longitudinal axis
the parties hotly contest how to define the effect of the` substantially vertical' limitation as it relates to the faces side_edges and side_walls on the outwardly extending projections

it is apparent that the faces 100 of the outwardly extending projections 28 in the preferred_embodiment of the244_patent are vertical
this may be seen for example in figures 2_and_3 above and is also evident from the description of the side_edges 102 in the preferred_embodiment as being vertical
a preferred_embodiment however is just that and the scope of a patentees claims is not necessarily or automatically limited to the preferred_embodiment
the entire_specification including all of the claims the prosecution_history and the prior_art may all affect the interpretation ultimately placed on claim language

we first review the entire_specification including all of the claims
in the specification the patentee used` substantially vertical' and` vertical' interchangeably when describing the faces of the projections
even within claim 1 the patentee used` substantially vertical_face' interchangeably with` vertical_face'
compare ?
6` substantially vertical_face' with ?
9` vertical_face'
the entire_specification thus leaves its reader with the impression that` substantially vertical' and` vertical' mean essentially the same thing in the244_patent at least as to the faces

we next review the prosecution_history of the244_patent to ascertain the true meaning or effect in the claims of the adverb` substantially' in the claim_limitation` substantially vertical_faces'
the prosecution_history in addition to being used while considering the factual issue of infringement and whether prosecution_history estoppel places any limitations on what infringes a claim should also be used when considering the legal issue of proper claim_construction

cir
( t 90 102 1983 prosecution *1560 history` is always relevant to a proper interpretation of a claim' citing astra sjuco a.b
v. united_states_int l_trade_comm n 67_c.c.p.a._128 629_f.2d_682 686 207_uspq_1 5 1980 ; autogiro co. of am
v. united_states 181_ct.cl._55 384_f.2d_391 395-99 155_uspq_697 701-04 1967
an examination of the prosecution_history is particularly important where as in the instant case the claimed invention is in a crowded art

during prosecution of the application for the244_patent244 application the examiner inter alia rejected the claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 as unpatentable over u.s._patent_no._4194,645 zabner645 in view of u.s. patent no._3353,708 davis708
fig._3 of zabner645 is reproduced below as figure 5
figs
1_and_4 of davis708 are reproduced below as figure 6
according to the examiner` [ t ] o modify [ zabner645 ] by providing portion 44 as discontinuous portions with a substantially vertical_face side_edges and side_walls would be obvious in view of [ davis708 ]'
portion 44 of zabner645 corresponds to face 100 in the244_patent
the examiner thus opined that the lid described in zabner645 closely approximated the lid claimed in the244 application the main difference between the two being the claimed substantially vertical_faces side_edges and side_walls

?
*1561. ?
in response to the ¡± 103 rejection the patentee asserted that unlike zabner645 the lid claimed in the244 application had projections with substantially vertical_faces and side_edges making the244 lid easy to strip from the mold while providing a much deeper undercut
since the patentee distinguished zabner645 based in part on the slope of the projection faces` substantially vertical' may be properly interpreted as not including lids with sloping faces like those of zabner645
in this regard one should also note the sloped faces of the mahaffy036 lid depicted in figure 7 below

?
*1562 we also note that during prosecution of the244 application the patentee again used` substantially vertical' and` vertical' interchangeably when describing the faces of the projections
for example in his response to the first office action the patentee alternated first referring to the faces as` substantially vertical' then` vertical' then` substantially vertical' then` vertical' then` substantially vertical'
this provides a further indication that the patentee thought of his substantially vertical_faces as essentially vertical

finally it is apparent from our review of the prior_art of record that lids of the general construction claimed in the244_patent were common in the industry
several prior_art lids depict outwardly extending projections with variously sloped outward faces as may be seen in the figures from some prior_art lid patents reproduced in the attached appendix
in order for claim 1 of the244_patent to` avoid' these prior_art lids` substantially vertical_face' must be construed as the same as or very close to` vertical_face'
see acs hosp sys. inc. v. montefiore hosp. 732_f.2d_1572 1577 221_uspq_929 932 fed.cir.1984` claims should be so construed if possible as to sustain their validity'

we conclude from our review of the district_courts opinion and from our de novo review of the entire_specification the prosecution_history and the prior_art that claim 1 does not permit amhil to exclude from the marketplace lids having protrusions with sloping faces like the faces shown for example in zabner645 and mahaffy036
in particular we interpret claim 1 to include only lids wherein the outwardly extending projections have well-defined faces that deviate only slightly if at all from the vertical
any other construction of claim 1 would render it invalid

d. literal infringement
literal infringement of a claim exists when every limitation recited in the claim is found in the accused device i.e. when the properly construed claim reads on the accused device exactly
johnston v. ivac corp. 885_f.2d_1574 1580 12_uspq2d_1382 1386 fed.cir.1989 citing cases
whether the properly construed claim in issue reads on the devices accused of infringing is a question of fact which we review for clear error
hilton davis chem co. v. warner-jenkinson co. 62_f.3d_1512 1520 35_uspq2d_1641 1647 fed.cir.1995 in banc` infringement whether literal or under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact'
( citing winans v. denmead 56 u.s. 15 how
330 338 14_l.ed._717_(1853) ; sri int l v. matsushita elec corp. of am. 775_f.2d_1107 1125 227_uspq_577 589 fed.cir.1985 in banc cert
granted -- - u.s. -- -- 116_s.ct._1014 134_l.ed.2d_95_(1996)
`` a finding isclearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it the reviewing court on the entire_evidence is left with the definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been committed'
united_states v. united_states gypsum co. 333_u.s._364 395 68_s.ct._525 542 92_l.ed._746 76_uspq_430 443 1948

we agree with the district_courts observation that` theoutwardly extending projections on the accused lids slope upwardly and inwardly towards the peripheral_cavity'
amhil_ii 34 uspq2d at 1648
the faces of the projections thus slope upwardly and inwardly
`` substantially vertical_faces' are not present therefore in the m & n_lids as we have construed that claim_limitation above
a comparison of figure 5 above with figure 8 below supports this
figure 8 depicts the composite rendering of two scale tracings of the accused m & n_lid
except for the` face' label that we added this drawing was attached to van melles declaration filed in opposition to m & ns motion for summary_judgment
figure 5 depicts the zabner645 lid wherein portion 44 corresponds to the` face' in figure 8
it is apparent that the slopes of these` faces' are very similar
consequently on the entire_evidence we are not left with a definite and firm_conviction that the district_court committed a mistake in finding that m & ns lids do not literally infringe the244_patent
the district_courts finding of no literal_infringement is not clearly erroneous and is affirmed

*1563. ?
in light of this holding we find it unnecessary to determine whether the accused m & n_lids comprise` substantially vertical_side_edges' or` substantially vertical_side_walls'
similarly we find it unnecessary to analyze whether the accused m & n_lids comprise the disputed` downwardly and inwardly' opening cavity extending around the periphery of the lid
we also find it unnecessary to reach amhils assertions that the district_court improperly read a cold-use limitation into the claims that the district_court improperly distinguished the accused lids because they employ a plug-fit or inside-fit design or that the district_court improperly found that the accused lids are formed from material that lacks flexibility

e. infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
after deciding that there was no literal_infringement of the244_patent the district_court correctly went on to decide whether there was infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
see hilton davis 62 f.3d at 1522 35 uspq2d at 1648` the trial judge does not have discretion to choose whether to apply the doctrine of equivalents when the record shows no literal_infringement`
like literal_infringement infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is an issue of fact
id.at 1521 35 uspq2d at 1647

nowhere in its opening_brief did appellant amhil mention infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
amhils only mention of the doctrine of equivalents appears in one paragraph on the penultimate page of its reply_brief
a reply_brief which should` reply to the brief of the appellee' see fed
r.app
p. 28 c is not the appropriate place to raise for the first time an issue for appellate review
we hold therefore that amhil has waived its right to appeal that portion of the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement under the doctrine of equivalents
see *1564 becton dickinson & co. v. c.r
bard inc. 922_f.2d_792 800 17_uspq2d_1097 1103 fed.cir.1990` an issue not raised by an appellant in its opening_brief.. is waived'

iii
amhil i personal jurisdiction over mazzarolo
as a result of our holdings above that the m & n_lids do not infringe the244_patent we need not decide whether the district_court in amhil i properly granted mazzarolos motion to dismiss the complaint as to him for lack of personal_jurisdiction

iv
conclusion
for the above reasons we affirm amhil_iis summary_judgment of no infringement
the appeal in amhil i and the issue of personal_jurisdiction over mazzarolo are now moot

each party shall bear its own costs

affirmed
