opinion
bryson circuit_judge
this case concerns a dispute between two major manufacturers of automotive glass ; the dispute revolves around glass compositions known as` solar_control_glass' which have the highly desirable characteristics of filtering out most of the suns ultraviolet and infrared_radiation while transmitting most of the light in the visible part of the spectrum
appellee ppg_industries inc. which holds a patent on a composition of solar_control_glass sued appellant guardian industries corporation for patent infringement and obtained a preliminary_injunction from the united_states_district_court for the western_district of pennsylvania
the injunction prohibits guardian from making using or selling its own composition of solar_control_glass
we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting preliminary_injunctive_relief to ppg and we therefore affirm the order of the district_court

i
on august 31 1993 the patent and trademark office issued u.s. patent no._5240,886 the886_patent which was assigned to ppg
shortly after obtaining the patent ppg advised guardian that it believed guardians solar_control_glass known as` solar management glass' smg infringed ppgs rights under the patent
litigation followed and after a five-day hearing the district_court granted ppgs motion for a preliminary_injunction

the district_court found that ppg had established a likelihood of success on the merits by making a strong showing that smg infringed ppgs rights under the patent and that the patent was not invalid
in light of ppgs showing on the merits the court held that ppg was entitled to a presumption that it would suffer irreparable_harm from guardians continued infringement
the court also found that the balance of hardships and the public_interest weighed in favor of granting ppgs request for preliminary_injunctive_relief
guardian brought this appeal contesting the district_courts ruling on each of those points

ii
a
the issue to which the parties devote the most attention is whether guardian infringed claim 1 of the886_patent and dependent_claims 3_and_4
claim 1 of the886_patent defines a glass composition consisting of soda-lime-silica glass to which is added a set of ingredients that have the effect of selectively filtering out most of the suns ultraviolet_radiation
the filtering ingredients are identified in the claim as cerium in the form of cerium_oxide ceo2 and iron in the ferric fe2o3 state
the claim requires that the composition have a total iron_content of at least 0.85 percent by weight and that the ratio of iron in the ferrous feo state to total iron known as the redox_ratio be no greater than 0.275

exhibiting ultraviolet_transmittance no greater than 31 percent 300_to_390 nanometers and luminous transmittance illuminant a of at least 70 percent both at a reference_thickness of 3.9 millimeters
dependent claim 3 adds the limitation that the dominant_wavelength of the light transmitted by the glass must be between 495_and_535 nanometers the green color range of the spectrum and dependent claim 4 adds the requirement that the glass must exhibit a total_solar_energy_transmittance including ultraviolet visible and infrared_radiation of less than 45 percent at a reference_thickness of 3.9 millimeters
the ultraviolet and visible_light transmission requirements set forth in the claims are those established by the automotive industry as the minimum standards for acceptable solar_control_glass
prior to the886 invention and guardians smg_glass solar_control_glass was often made with a significant amount of cerium a rare earth element in the form of cerium_oxide
the principal benefit of the invention claimed in the886_patent as explained in the specification is that it permits a manufacturer of solar_control_glass to meet industry standards while adding either no cerium or relatively little cerium to the glass
minimizing the amount of cerium used in the glass is valuable because cerium is expensive and because it has the undesirable effect after long-term exposure to ultraviolet_radiation of darkening the glass in which it is present

the specification of the886_patent contains a set of examples of compositions falling within the scope of claim 1 of the patent
the examples include several compositions containing relatively small_amounts of cerium between 0.big_token__27_and_0__big_token31 percent_cerium by weight and one composition containing essentially no cerium
each of the examples satisfies the transmittance requirements of the claim for visible_light and ultraviolet_radiation
the example that contains no cerium however shows a particularly low_redox_ratio
a low_redox_ratio together with a relatively large amount of iron has the effect of compensating for the absence of cerium in filtering out ultraviolet_radiation
with respect to the no-cerium_example the specification further states that
the very low ferrous to total_iron_ratio required when no cerium is used may be difficult to attain in some melting furnaces
therefore it is preferred that a small_amount of cerium be used to yield the desired reduction in ultraviolet_transmittance without requiring an unduly low ferrous to total_iron_ratio

while the886_patent application was pending before the pto ppg obtained a sample of guardians smg_glass and tested it
when ppgs tests showed that the smg_sample did not meet the automobile_manufacturers standards for ultraviolet_transmittance ppg advised guardian of those results
guardian responded that under its tests smg met the 31 percent_ultraviolet_transmittance requirement for the 300_to_390 nanometer range
when ppg re-examined its testing_procedures it discovered that the software it was using in its testing_equipment was flawed and that as a result the testing_equipment had made an error in calculating not only the ultraviolet_transmittance of the smg_sample but also the ultraviolet_transmittance of each of the examples set forth in the886_patent specification
because of the software_error the ultraviolet_transmittance reported in each example was about three percent too high ; thus the glass tested in each example was actually filtering out about three percent more ultraviolet_radiation than the testing_equipment indicated
that error had led the inventors to suggest in the specification that a glass meeting the limitations of the patent and containing no cerium at all might be difficult to make commercially as it would require a redox_ratio that would be hard to achieve in some commercial furnaces
in fact however the transmittance_limitations of the claims for a no-cerium glass are not as difficult to satisfy as the specification suggests because after an adjustment is made for the three percent_calculation_error the redox_ratio for the no-cerium_embodiment *1562 does not have to be as low as the specification indicates

based on the three percent_calculation_error guardian argues that the claims of the886_patent do not cover smg
if the claims are read in light of the specification guardian argues they can not be construed to apply to smg because the examples in the specification make clear that the inventors did not believe that a glass having the composition of smg would satisfy the 31 percent ultraviolet transmission requirement

the problem with guardians argument is that the claims simply can not be construed as guardian suggests
by their plain terms the claims read on smg the critical limitations require that the glass contain less than 0.5 percent_cerium and more than 0.85 percent iron that the redox_ratio of the iron components be less than 0.275 that the ultraviolet_transmittance be no greater than 31 percent and that the visible_light_transmittance be at least 70 percent
smg satisfies all of those limitations and thus infringes claim 1 of the886_patent
moreover because the dominant_wavelength transmitted by smg is within the green range 495_to_535 nanometers and because smgs total_solar_energy_transmittance at the 3.9 millimeter reference_thickness is less than 45 percent it falls within the limitations of dependent_claims 3_and_4 as well

it is true that if guardians smg_glass is tested with the same flawed_testing_equipment that was used to prepare the examples in the886_patent specification smgs ultraviolet_transmittance would appear to be above the 31 percent maximum set forth in the claims
but the886_patent_claims are not qualified in that manner ; the claims cover glass that transmits no more than 31 percent of the suns ultraviolet_radiation not glass that is measured at no more than 31 percent_ultraviolet_transmittance with ppgs flawed testing system
because it is undisputed that smg transmits no more than 31 percent of the suns ultraviolet_radiation over the wavelength range of 300_to_390 nanometers and because that is the way the ultraviolet_transmittance_limitation is specified in the patent_claims the claims can not be construed in a way that renders smg non-infringing

b
in the alternative guardian argues that if the claims are interpreted to read on smg the patent is invalid under section 112 of the patent act 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
guardian makes three arguments in support of its section 112 claim
first guardian contends that the claims run afoul of the requirement of particularity and distinctness in paragraph 2 of section 112 because they fail to point out and distinctly claim what the inventors regarded as their invention
second guardian argues that the claims violate paragraph 2 of section 112 for the additional reason that the inventors failed to state the method they used to measure the ultraviolet_transmittance of the invention
third guardian asserts that the patent is invalid because in order for the claims to read on smg the claims must be interpreted as extending beyond the invention disclosed in the specification
in its reply brief guardian makes explicit that its third argument is based on the` enablement' requirement of paragraph 1 of section 112 not the` written description' requirement that appears in the same paragraph

we reject each of the section 112 arguments on which guardian_relies
first paragraph two of section 112` is essentially a requirement for precision and definiteness of claim_language' in re borkowski 422_f.2d_904 909 164_uspq_642 646 c.c.p.a.1970 emphasis in original ; the` requirement is that the language of the claims must make it clear what subject_matter they encompass' in re hammack 427_f.2d_1378 1382 166_uspq_204 208 c.c.p.a.1970

there is nothing imprecise or indefinite about the claim_language in the886_patent
the claims are quite precise in quantifying the essential ingredients and transmittance tolerances of the claimed compositions on their face the claims give clear notice of what compositions fall within their scope
because the claims` reasonably apprise those skilled in the art both of the utilization and scope of the invention' and because` the language is as precise as the *1563 subject_matter permits' shatterproof glass corp. v. libbey-owens ford co. 758_f.2d_613 624 225_uspq_634 641 fed.cir.1985 internal quotation omitted cert
dismissed 474_u.s._976 106_s.ct._340 88_l.ed.2d_326_(1985) the claims are not invalid for indefiniteness

guardian argues that the patent nonetheless violates paragraph 2 of section 112 because the inventors would not have believed at the time of their application that glass having the composition of smg could meet the transmittance_limitations of the claims
that misconception on the part of the inventors however does not mean that they failed to` distinctly claim [ ] the subject_matter which [ they ] regard [ ed ] as [ their ] invention'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
2
the inventors regarded their invention as a glass containing filtering ingredients within the defined composition ranges and producing an ultraviolet_transmittance of no more than 31 percent and a visible_light_transmittance of at least 70 percent and that is what they claimed
guardian_relies on cases in which the claims included` a substantial measure of inoperatives' in re corkill 771_f.2d_1496 1501 226_uspq_1005 1009 fed.cir.1985 or cases in which` some material submitted by applicant other than his specification shows that a claim does not correspond in scope with what he regards as his invention' in re conley 490_f.2d_972 976 180_uspq_454 457 c.c.p.a.1974 emphasis in original ; citing in re cormany 476_f.2d_998 177_uspq_450_(c.c.p.a.1973) and in re prater 415_f.2d_1393 162_uspq_541_(c.c.p.a.1969)
in this case by contrast the claims were written in a manner that required all the embodiments to be operative ; the claims set out exactly what the inventors intended to claim as their invention ; and guardian does not point to any statement by the applicants outside the specification that indicates that they did not intend to claim all species having the recited limitations
moreover nothing in the specification renders any of the claim_language ambiguous such that a person skilled in the art would be uncertain about` what subject_matter falls within the scope of the claims'
in re miller 441_f.2d_689 692 169_uspq_597 599 c.c.p.a.1971 ; see in re moore 439_f.2d_1232 1235 169_uspq_236 238 c.c.p.a.1971
there is therefore no force to guardians argument that the claims did not accurately and distinctly set out what the inventors regarded as their invention

second the patent is not rendered invalid on the ground that the inventors failed to specify the method to be used in measuring the ultraviolet_transmittance set forth in the claims
the evidence at the preliminary_injunction hearing established that setting aside the equipment error that plagued ppgs testing_procedures all of the conventional methods of testing ultraviolet_transmittance produce essentially identical results
accordingly the claim limitation of no more than 31 percent_ultraviolet_transmittance in conjunction with the other limitations is sufficiently definite to put the public on fair notice of what compositions fall within the scope of the claims
see hybritech inc. v. monoclonal antibodies inc. 802_f.2d_1367 1385 231_uspq_81 94-95 fed.cir.1986 cert
denied 480_u.s._947 107_s.ct._1606 94_l.ed.2d_792_(1987)

third the specification satisfies the enablement_requirement of section 112 paragraph 1 which requires that the specification contain a description` of the manner and process of making and using [ the invention ] in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains.. to make and use the same'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1
the specification of the886_patent describes in ample detail how to make and use the invention with respect to the seven specific embodiments set forth in the experimental examples
and guardian does not dispute that the specification enables all embodiments falling within the other claim limitations and having an ultraviolet_transmittance of 28 percent or less which is the transmittance that ppgs flawed_testing_equipment reported as 31 percent
the only contested issue is whether the886_patent must be held invalid on the ground that the specification fails to satisfy the enablement_requirement with respect to embodiments having an actual ultraviolet_transmittance of less than 31 percent *1564 but which ppgs equipment would have reported as more than 31 percent

in pressing its enablement argument guardian focuses on the portion of the specification that suggests a particularly low_redox_ratio is necessary to satisfy the ultraviolet_transmittance_limitation if the patented_invention is made without any cerium
the test results and the statement on which guardian_relies are products of ppgs software_error ; the effect of the error was to make the ultraviolet_transmittance figures appear artificially high and thus to make it appear that in order to attain the 31 percent ultraviolet_transmittance_limitation in the claims the composition would need more iron and a lower_redox_ratio both of which have the effect of reducing ultraviolet_transmittance

we are not persuaded that the calculation_error and the statements in the specification regarding the need for a low_redox_ratio in a no-cerium_embodiment of the invention give rise to a violation of the enablement_requirement
it is true that in order to be enabling a specification` must teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the full_scope of the claimed invention withoutundue_experimentation
`` in re wright 999_f.2d_1557 1561 27_uspq2d_1510 1513 fed.cir.1993 ; in re_vaeck 947_f.2d_488 495-96 20_uspq2d_1438 1444-45 fed.cir.1991
moreover guardian is correct that a careful reader of the specification could well conclude that a glass with the iron_content and redox_ratio of smg would not be likely to satisfy the ultraviolet_transmittance_limitation of the claims
the district_court found however that ppgs calculation_error was` harmless inconsequential and easily detectable by anyone who was skilled in the art of processing solar controlled glass'
we interpret that statement as a factual_finding that ppgs error could be discovered without` undue_experimentation' by a person having ordinary skill in the art and thus that the enablement_requirement of section 112 was satisfied
see in re_vaeck 947 f.2d at 495 20 uspq2d at 1444` enablement.. is a question of law which we independently review although based upon underlying factual_findings which we review for clear_error
``

in light of the district_courts finding we can not agree with guardian that the specification of the886_patent does not` teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the full_scope of the claimed invention'
in re wright 999 f.2d at 1561 27 uspq2d at 1513
in unpredictable art areas this court has refused to find broad generic claims enabled by specifications that demonstrate the enablement of only one or a few embodiments and do not demonstrate with reasonable specificity how to make and use other potential embodiments across the full_scope of the claim
see e.g. in re goodman 11_f.3d_1046 1050-52 29_uspq2d_2010 2013-15 fed.cir.1993 ; amgen inc. v. chugai pharmaceutical co. 927_f.2d_1200 1212-14 18_uspq2d_1016 1026-28 fed.cir
) cert
denied 502_u.s._856 112_s.ct._169 116_l.ed.2d_132_(1991) ; in re_vaeck 947 f.2d at 496 20 uspq2d at 1445
enablement is lacking in those cases the court has explained because the undescribed embodiments can not be made based on the disclosure in the specification without undue_experimentation
but the question of undue_experimentation is a matter of degree
the fact that some experimentation is necessary does not preclude enablement ; what is required is that the amount of experimentation` must not be unduly extensive'
atlas_powder_co. v. e.i
dupont de nemours & co. 750_f.2d_1569 1576 224_uspq_409 413 fed.cir.1984
the patent and trademark office board of appeals summarized the point well when it stated the test is not merely quantitative since a considerable amount of experimentation is permissible if it is merely routine or if the specification in question provides a reasonable amount of guidance with respect to the direction in which the experimentation should proceed to enable the determination of how to practice a desired embodiment of the invention claimed
ex parte jackson 217_uspq_804 807 1982

in this case the district_court was justified in finding that undue_experimentation would not be required to make an embodiment of the886_patent having the same_composition and transmittance_properties as smg
one of the examples in the specification describes *1565 a glass containing no cerium but having a lower_redox_ratio and a higher iron_content than smg
the specification teaches that as the iron_content of the glass is reduced and the redox_ratio rises the glass transmits more ultraviolet_radiation
a person reading the specification could therefore start with the no-cerium_example and make a glass similar to smg by simply lowering the iron_content and allowing the redox_ratio to rise until the ultraviolet_transmittance reached the 31 percent limitation

another example given in the specification has roughly the same_composition as smg except that it contains a small_amount of cerium
following the principles taught in the specification an experimenter could produce an embodiment of the886_patent with a composition and properties similar to smg simply by keeping the iron_content and the redox_ratio fixed and reducing the cerium_content to zero
in preparing that embodiment the experimenter would discover that the ultraviolet_transmittance calculations for the examples found in the patent specification are a few percent too high but that error would not affect the experimenters ability to make the desired embodiment

where the specification provides` guidance in selecting the operating parameters that would yield the claimed result' in re colianni 561_f.2d_220 224 195_uspq_150 153 c.c.p.a.1977 miller j. concurring emphasis omitted it is fair to conclude that the experimentation required to make a particular embodiment is not` undue'
although ppgs software_error made it appear that commercial production of a no-cerium composition that satisfied the transmittance_limitations would be difficult the specification made it clear that such a composition could be made and it indicated to one skilled in the art how to maintain low ultraviolet_transmittance while minimizing the cerium_content of the glass
thus the specification gave` considerable direction and guidance on how to practice [ the ] invention'
in re wands 858_f.2d_731 740 8_uspq2d_1400 1406 fed.cir.1988

in light of the guidance provided by the specification this case is quite different from those in which enablement has been found lacking because of the need for` undue_experimentation'
see e.g. white consol indus. inc. v. vega servo-control inc. 713_f.2d_788 790-92 218_uspq_961 962-64 fed.cir.1983 a requirement of 18 months to two years work to practice the patented_invention is` undue_experimentation' ; in re ghiron 442_f.2d_985 992 169_uspq_723 727-28 c.c.p.a.1971 a development period of`many months or years.. does not bespeak a routine operation but of extensive experimentation and development work`
it was therefore reasonable for the district_court to conclude that the patent was not invalid for lack of enablement

c. guardian next contends that it does not infringe ppgs rights under the886_patent because smg contains a sulfur compound that significantly affects its filtering properties and the claims of the886_patent therefore do not read on smg_glass
the district_court acknowledged that smg contains sulfur but it found that the sulfur contained in smg has no material effect on the filtering properties of the glass

guardian contends that the district_court committed clear_error in the factual_finding it made on the sulfur_issue
the courts finding however was based on an extensive exploration of the issue through testimony and documents at the five-day preliminary_injunction hearing
although guardian introduced documentary evidence that sulfur can affect the transmittance_properties of glass guardian did not persuade the district_court-and has not persuaded us-that those authorities prove that sulfur has such an effect when the redox_ratio is as low as it is in guardians accused smg product

guardian challenges the testimony of ppgs expert on the sulfur_issue but the court heard testimony by experts from both sides and found ppgs expert testimony more convincing
because we do not find ppgs presentation on the sulfur_issue inherently implausible we are satisfied that the district_courts finding on that issue is not clearly erroneous

*1566 d. guardians next argument is that ppg failed to satisfy its burden of showing that the886_patent is likely to survive challenges based on guardians defenses of anticipation and obviousness
before the district_court guardian argued that example 4 in russian patent no._948912 anticipated or at least rendered obvious claim 1 of the886_patent
guardian urges that in rejecting its contention the district_court applied an erroneous legal standard and did not make sufficiently detailed factual_findings to permit meaningful review by this court

the district_court concluded that there was no factual basis to support a finding of invalidity because the russian_patent teaches that significant_amounts of cerium and other rare earth elements that absorb ultraviolet light are necessary to reduce ultraviolet transmission to the level set forth in claim 1 of the886_patent
to be sure the district_court did not articulate the correct legal standard when it stated that to invalidate a patent the prior reference must` give the same knowledge and the same directions' as the challenged patent
the ultimate question however is whether the challengers evidence of invalidity is sufficiently persuasive that it is likely to overcome the presumption of patent_validity
see new england braiding co. v. a.w
chesterton co. 970_f.2d_878 883 23_uspq2d_1622 1625 fed.cir.1992
in view of the limited record presented to the district_court on this issue we agree with the courts conclusion that guardians argument based on the russian_patent failed to` raise [ ] a substantial question' of invalidity
id

to anticipate a claim a reference must disclose every element of the challenged claim and enable one skilled in the art to make the anticipating subject_matter
chester v. miller 906_f.2d_1574 1576_n._2 15_uspq2d_1333 1336_n._2_(fed.cir.1990) ; in re donohue 766_f.2d_531 533 226_uspq_619 621 fed.cir.1985
guardian has not shown that the composition described in example 4 of the russian_patent meets the limitations of the claim because that composition contains significant_amounts of several rare earth elements that absorb ultraviolet_radiation as well as visible_light

in presenting its defense of obviousness guardian again relied principally on the russian_patent
in the district_court however guardian did not demonstrate that the claimed invention would have been obvious to one skilled in the art in light of the disclosures in that reference
in its presentation to us moreover guardian has not pointed to any evidence showing that the district_courts factual_finding that the russian_patent teaches away is clearly erroneous
therefore guardian has failed to provide any basis for concluding that one skilled in the art would have been motivated to eliminate the additional rare earth elements recited in example 4 of the russian_patent and would have had a reasonable expectation of success in light of the prior art
see in re dow chemical co. 837_f.2d_469 473 5_uspq2d_1529 1531 fed.cir.1988
for purposes of the preliminary_injunction proceedings ppg has thus satisfied its burden of showing a likelihood of success on the validity issue

e. guardian also challenges the district_courts conclusion that ppg would suffer irreparable_harm if preliminary_injunctive_relief were not granted
because the district_court found that ppg had made a clear showing that it was likely to prevail on the issues of patent_validity and infringement the court held that ppg was entitled to a presumption of irreparable_harm
see h.h
robertson co. v. united steel deck inc. 820_f.2d_384 390 2_uspq2d_1926 1930 fed.cir.1987 ; atlas_powder_co. v. ireco chemicals 773_f.2d_1230 1233 227_uspq_289 292 fed.cir.1985
in addition the district_court found that in the absence of injunctive relief ppgs significant position in the solar_control_glass market would be threatened

guardian places heavy reliance on this courts decision in high tech medical instrumentation inc. v. new image indus. inc. 49_f.3d_1551 33_uspq2d_2005_(fed.cir.1995) where the court reversed a preliminary_injunction in part because of an inadequate showing of irreparable_harm
in that case however the court concluded that the *1567 patentee was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim and therefore held that the presumption of irreparable_harm was inapplicable
49 f.3d at 1556 33 uspq2d at 2009
in this case by contrast we have upheld the district_courts conclusion that ppg is likely to succeed at the merits_stage on the issues of infringement and validity and we agree that ppgs showing on those issues was sufficiently strong to invoke the presumption of irreparable_harm
because we agree with the district_court that guardian failed to rebut that presumption we sustain the courts ruling that ppg met its burden of showing that it would suffer irreparable_harm in the absence of an order granting preliminary_injunctive_relief

f. finally guardian argues that the balance of hardships and the public_interest both counsel in favor of denying the injunction
the district_court however considered both factors and reached the contrary conclusion and we are not prepared to overturn that determination
the district_court concluded that ppg would suffer significant harm from the denial of an injunction while an injunction would be less burdensome for guardian as it would require only a temporary interruption in guardians production and sale of its smg_glass
with regard to the public_interest the court acknowledged that an injunction would deprive the public of one of the suppliers of solar_control_glass
the court however balanced that interest against the strong public policy favoring the enforcement of patent rights
because the court found it unlikely that the injunction would result in a shortage of solar_control_glass the court found that on balance the public_interest favored ppg

guardian argues that ppg will be unable to satisfy the requirements of guardians customers particularly the large automobile_manufacturers for solar_control_glass
to address that objection however the district_court gave guardian the right to return to court for relief from the preliminary_injunction if guardian were unable to fulfill its current contracts with automobile_manufacturers either with noninfringing compositions or by purchase from ppg on reasonable terms
guardian made an initial request for temporary relief from the injunction which was granted
the record does not reflect that guardian has made any further requests although the district_court has made clear that it would be prepared to entertain any such requests if they should be made
in the absence of a showing that the district_court has been unresponsive to guardians interest in fulfilling its current contract obligations or to the publics interest in obtaining an adequate supply of solar_control_glass we can not conclude that the district_court abused its discretion in finding that both the balance of hardships and the public_interest favor ppg

iii
the unusual circumstances surrounding the prosecution of the886_patent have made this preliminary_injunction proceeding difficult
nonetheless we have carefully reviewed each of the numerous legal points that guardian has raised in challenging the injunction and we conclude that none of them requires that we upset the district_courts order
guardian will have an opportunity at the merits_stage to present and expand upon the arguments it has made at the preliminary_injunction stage as well as any additional arguments that it chooses to present and the district_court will be able to give those arguments plenary consideration at that time
the record as it now stands however compels us to conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary_injunction
