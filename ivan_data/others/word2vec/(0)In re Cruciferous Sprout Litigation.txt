background
the three patents-in-suit relate to growing and eating sprouts to reduce the level of carcinogens in animals thereby reducing the risk of developing cancer
specifically the patents describe methods of preparing food_products that contain high_levels of substances that induce phase 2 enzymes
these enzymes are part of the human_bodys mechanism for detoxifying potential_carcinogens
thus they have a chemoprotective_effect against cancer
¡¬ 895 patent col._1,_ll._28-34
foods that are rich in glucosinolates such as certain cruciferous_sprouts have high_phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential
the inventors of the patents-in-suit recognized that the phase 2 enzyme-inducing agents or their glucosinolate precursors are far more concentrated in certain sprouts such as broccoli and cauliflower but not cabbage cress mustard or radish that are harvested before the two-leaf_stage than in corresponding adult plants
id.at col._7,_l._63 col._8,_l._14
however glucosinolate levels in cruciferous_plants can be highly variable
see id.at col._12,_ll._66-67` there is variation in inducer_potential among different broccoli cultivars`
according to the inventors it is therefore desirable to select the seeds of those cruciferous_plants which when germinated and harvested before the two-leaf_stage produce sprouts that contain high_levels of the desired enzyme-inducing potential

the ¡¬895_patent was filed on september 15 1995 and claims inter alia` a method of preparing a food_product rich in glucosinolates comprising germinated cruciferous_seeds with the exception of cabbage cress mustard and radish seeds and harvesting_sprouts prior to the 2-leaf_stage to form a food_product comprising a plurality of sprouts'
¡¬895_patent claim 1
the ¡¬ 567 patent is a continuation of the ¡¬895_application and it claims a` method of preparing a human food_product' from sprouts
¡¬567_patent claims 1_and_9
the ¡¬505_patent is a divisional of the ¡¬895_application and it claims a` method of increasing the chemoprotective amount of phase 2 enzymes in a mammal' as well as a` method of reducing the level of carcinogens in a mammal' by creating a` food_product' from sprouts and then` administering said food_product' to a mammal
¡¬505_patent claims 1_and_16

pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1407 the judicial_panel on multidistrict_litigation consolidated the various cases in the district of maryland for pretrial proceedings
on june_7,_2001 the defendants filed a joint motion for partial summary_judgment of invalidity arguing that the patents were anticipated by prior_art_references disclosing growing and eating sprouts
brassica filed a cross-motion for summary_judgment that the patents are not invalid
on july_23,_2001 the district_court held a markman hearing to address claim construction issues and the parties motions for summary_judgment

on august 10 2001 the court granted defendants motion for summary_judgment of invalidity and denied brassicas cross-motion for summary_judgment
according to the district_court` [ t ] he record before the court makes it abundantly clear that prior to the issuance of the patents-in-suit one skilled in the art could by following the teachings of the prior_art germinate broccoli seeds harvest the sprouts and sell them as a food_product'
in re_cruciferous_sprout_patent_litig. 168 f.supp.2d at 540 60 uspq2d at 1762
while recognizing that the inventors of the patents-in-suit may have discovered a new and significant property of certain_types of cruciferous_sprouts the district_court concluded that` merely describing unexpected beneficial results of a known process does not entitle plaintiffs to patent that process'
id.at 538 60 uspq2d at 1760
thus a` plant broccoli sprouts long well known in nature and cultivated and eaten by humans for decades [ can not ] be patented merely on the basis of a recent realization that the plant has always had some heretofore unknown but naturally occurring beneficial feature'
id.at 537 60 uspq2d at 1759
on october 1 2001 the court entered a judgment under rule 54 b in favor of defendants but limited its invalidity ruling to claims 1-big_token__6_and_9__big_token of the ¡¬895_patent claims 1-8 of the ¡¬567_patent and claims 1_and_16 of the ¡¬505_patent

discussion
this court reviews a grant of summary_judgment de novo drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party
see e.g. anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

anticipation is a question of fact gen. elec co. v. nintendo co. 179_f.3d_1350 1353 50_uspq2d_1910 1912 fed.cir.1999 and is determined by first construing the claims and then comparing the properly construed claims to the prior_art gechter v. davidson 116_f.3d_1454 1457 43_uspq2d_1030 1032 fed.cir.1997

*1347 i. brassica contends that the district_court erroneously construed the claims by failing to treat the preamble of claim 1 of the ¡¬895_patent as a limitation of the claims
in addition brassica argues that the district_court failed to construe the limitations` rich in glucosinolates' appearing in claims 1_and_9 of the ¡¬895_patent and` high_phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential' appearing in claim 1 of the ¡¬567_patent and claims 1_and_16 of the ¡¬505_patent

no litmus test defines when a preamble limits claim scope

u.s.a. inc. 868_f.2d_1251 1257 9_uspq2d_1962 1966 fed.cir.1989
whether to treat a preamble as a limitation is a determination` resolved only on review of the entirety of the patent to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented and intended to encompass by the claim'
id
; catalina_mktg_.
int l v. coolsavings.com inc. 289_f.3d_801 808 62_uspq2d_1781 1785 fed.cir.2002
in general a preamble limits the claimed invention if it recites essential structure or steps or if it is` necessary to give life meaning and vitality' to the claim
catalina mktg. 289 f.3d at 808 62 uspq2d at 1784 quoting pitney bowes inc. v. hewlett-packard co. 182_f.3d_1298 1305 51_uspq2d_1161 1165 fed.cir.1999
clear reliance on the preamble during prosecution to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior_art may indicate that the preamble is a claim_limitation because the preamble is used to define the claimed invention
catalina mktg. 289 f.3d at 808 62 uspq2d at 1785 ; bristol-myers squibb co. v. ben venue labs. inc. 246_f.3d_1368 1375 58_uspq2d_1508 1513 fed.cir.2001

in this case both the specification and prosecution history indicate that the phrase` rich in glucosinolates' helps to define the claimed invention and is therefore a limitation of claim 1 of the ¡¬895_patent
the specification for example states that` this invention relates to the production and consumption of foods which are rich in cancer_chemoprotective_compounds'
¡¬ 895 patent col._1,_ll._18-19
a stated object of the invention is` to provide food_products and food additives that are rich in cancer_chemoprotective_compounds'
id.at col._2,_ll._38-39
the specification therefore indicates that the inventors believed their invention to be making food_products that are rich in chemoprotective compounds or in other words food_products` rich in glucosinolates
`` 1 in addition during reexamination2 of the ¡¬895_patent the patentee argued as follows

claim 1 of the patent for example is directed to` [ a ] method of preparing a *1348 food_product rich in glucosinolates.. and harvesting_sprouts prior to the 2-leaf_stage to form a food_product comprising a plurality of sprouts'
...
although` rich in glucosinolates' is recited in the preamble of the claim the pertinent case law holds that the preamble is given weight if it breathes life and meaning into the claim..
accordingly the cited prior_art does not anticipate the claims because it does not explicitly teach a method of preparing a food_product comprising cruciferous_sprouts that are rich in glucosinolates or contain high_levels of phase 2 inducer_activity
this language shows a clear reliance by the patentee on the preamble to persuade the patent_office that the claimed invention is not anticipated by the prior_art
as such the preamble is a limitation of the claims
see bristol-myers squibb 246 f.3d at 1375 58 uspq2d at 1513
brassica also asks this court to construe the phrases` rich in glucosinolates' and` high_phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential' to require` at least 200,000 units per gram_fresh_weight of phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential at 3-days following incubation under conditions in which cruciferous_seeds germinate and grow'
¡¬895_patent col._7,_ll._47-53

`` [ t ] he words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and accustomed meaning unless it appears from the specification or the file history that they were used differently by the inventor'
carroll touch inc. v. electro mech
sys. inc. 15_f.3d_1573 1577 27_uspq2d_1836 1840 fed.cir.1993
however` limitations appearing in the specification will not be read into claims and.. interpreting what is meant by a word in a claimis not to be confused with adding an extraneous limitation appearing in the specification which is improper
`` intervet am. inc. v. kee-vet labs. inc. 887_f.2d_1050 1053 12_uspq2d_1474 1476 fed.cir.1989
brassicas proposed construction violates this rule by improperly importing limitations from the specification into the claims
true the specification states that` [ s ] uitable sprouts will have at least 200,000 units per gram of fresh weight of phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential following 3-days incubation of seeds under conditions in which the seeds germinate and grow'
¡¬895_patent col._10,_l._66 col._11,_l._2
the specification does not however indicate that the phrases` rich in glucosinolates' or` high in phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential' are limited to these precise conditions
rather the specification uses the term` high' in its ordinary comparative sense to mean` not low'
for example the specification states that` [ t ] he cruciferous_sprouts of the instant_invention have higher phase 2 enzyme-inducer_potential than market stage plants' id.at col._14,_ll._5-7 and the` phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential of such sprouts may be as much as several hundred times higher than that observed in adult market stage vegetables obtained from the same_seeds' id.at col._8,_ll._6-9 ; see also innovad inc. v. microsoft corp. 260_f.3d_1326 1332 59_uspq2d_1676 1680 fed.cir.2001 construing the term` small volume' based in part on the specifications use of the phrase in its general sense to mean` not large'
likewise the term` rich' is not specifically defined or limited by the specification but instead is used in its ordinary relative sense
see e.g. id.at col._11,_ll._15-17` mature brussels sprouts and rapeseed are rich in these undesirable glucosinolates
`` ; col._11,_ll._37-39` seeds as well as sprouts have been found to be extremely rich in inducer_potential
``

brassicas proposed construction is also inconsistent with the language of the dependent claims
claim 19 of the ¡¬567_patent recites` the method according to *big_token__1349_claim_1__big_token wherein said seeds produce cruciferous_sprouts containing at least 200,000 units per gram_fresh_weight of phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential measured after 3-days of growth'
¡¬567_patent col._22,_ll._62-65
brassicas proposed construction would render this claim meaningless
see comark communications inc. v. harris corp. 156_f.3d_1182 1187 48_uspq2d_1001 1005-06 fed.cir.1998 finding a violation of the doctrine of claim differentiation when a proposed construction would render another claim superfluous
we therefore reject brassicas proposed claim construction for the phrases` rich in glucosinolates' and` high in phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential'

ii
having construed the claim_limitations at issue we now compare the claims to the prior_art to determine if the prior_art anticipates those claims
in order to prove that a claim is anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b defendants must present clear and convincing evidence that a single prior_art reference discloses either expressly or inherently each limitation of the claim
minn. mining & mfg co. v. johnson & johnson orthopaedics inc. 976_f.2d_1559 1565 24_uspq2d_1321 1326 fed.cir.1992

brassica argues that the prior_art does not expressly or inherently disclose the claim_limitations of` preparing a food_product rich in glucosinolates' claims 1_and_9 of the ¡¬895_patent or` identifying seeds which produce cruciferous_sprouts.. containing high_phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential' claims 1_and_16 of the ¡¬505_patent claim 1 of the ¡¬567_patent
according to brassica the prior_art merely discusses growing and eating sprouts without mention of any glucosinolates or phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential and without specifying that particular_sprouts having these beneficial characteristics should be assembled into a` food_product
`` 3 moreover brassica argues the prior_art does not inherently disclose these limitations because` at most one following the prior_art would have a possibility or probability of producing a food_product high in phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential' and the` fact that one following the prior_art might have selected seeds meeting the limitations of the claims is not sufficient to establish inherent anticipation'

it is well settled that a prior_art reference may anticipate when the claim_limitations not expressly found in that reference are nonetheless inherent in it
see e.g. atlas_powder co. v. ireco inc. 190_f.3d_1342 51_uspq2d_1943_(fed.cir.1999) ; titanium_metals_corp. v. banner 778_f.2d_775 227_uspq_773_(fed.cir.1985)
`` under the principles of inherency if the prior_art necessarily functions in accordance with or includes the claimed limitations it anticipates'

`` inherency is not necessarily coterminous with the knowledge of those of ordinary_skill in the art
artisans of ordinary_skill may not recognize the inherent_characteristics or functioning of the prior_art'
mehl/biophile 192 f.3d at 1365 52 uspq2d at 1305-06 ; *1350 atlas_powder 190 f.3d at 1347 51 uspq2d at 1946-47

brassica does not claim to have invented a new kind of sprout or a new way of growing or harvesting_sprouts
rather brassica recognized that some sprouts are rich in glucosinolates and high in phase 2 enzyme-inducing activity while other sprouts are not
see ¡¬895_patent col._10,_ll._28-42` sprouts suitable as sources of cancer chemoprotectants are generally cruciferous_sprouts with the exception of cabbage brassica olecracea capitata cress lepidiumsativum mustard sinapis alba and s. niger and radish raphanus sativus sprouts`
but the glucosinolate_content and phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential of sprouts necessarily have existed as long as sprouts themselves which is certainly more than one year before the date of application at issue here
see e.g. karen cross whyte the complete sprouting cookbook 4 1973 noting that in` 2939 b.c. the emperor of china recorded the use of health giving sprouts'
stated differently a sprouts glucosinolate_content and phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential are inherent_characteristics of the sprout
cf
brian r. clement hippocrates health program 8 1989 referring to` [ i ] nherent enzyme inhibitors phytates natural insecticides oxalates etc. present in every seed'
it matters not that those of ordinary_skill heretofore may not have recognized these inherent_characteristics of the sprouts
mehl/biophile 192 f.3d at 1365 52 uspq2d at 1305

titanium_metals_corp. v. banner is particularly instructive in this regard
in that case the claim at issue recited a titanium_base_alloy consisting essentially by weight of about 0.6 % to 0.9 % nickel 0.2 % to 0.4 % molybdenum up to 0.2 % maximum iron balance titanium said alloy being characterized by good_corrosion_resistance in hot_brine_environments
titanium_metals 778 f.2d at 776 227 uspq at 774
the prior_art disclosed a titanium_base_alloy having the recited components of the claim but the prior_art did not disclose that such an alloy was` characterized by good_corrosion_resistance in hot_brine_environments'
we nevertheless held that the claim was anticipated by the prior_art because` it is immaterial on the issue of their novelty what inherent_properties the alloys have or whether these applicants discovered certain inherent_properties'
id.at 782 774_f.2d_483 227 uspq at 779
titanium_metals explained the rationale behind this common sense conclusion the basic provision of title 35 applicable here is ¡± 101 providing in relevant part` whoever invents or discovers any new.. composition of matter or any new.. improvement thereof may obtain a patent therefor subject to the conditions and requirements of this title'
..... [ c ] ounsel never came to grips with the real issues 1 what do the claims cover and 2 is what they cover new ?
under the laws congress wrote they must be considered
congress has not seen fit to permit the patenting of an old alloy known to others through a printed publication by one who has discovered its corrosion resistance or other useful properties or has found out to what extent one can modify the composition of the alloy without losing such properties
id.at 780 782 778_f.2d_775 227 uspq at 777-78
brassica has done nothing more than recognize properties inherent in certain prior_art sprouts just like the corrosion resistance properties inherent to the *1351 prior_art alloy in titanium_metals.4 while brassica may have recognized something quite interesting about those sprouts it simply has not invented anything new

brassica nevertheless argues that its claims are not anticipated because the prior_art does not disclose selecting the particular seeds that will germinate as sprouts rich in glucosinolates and high in phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential as opposed to selecting other kinds of seeds to sprout in order to form a food_product
we disagree
the prior_art teaches sprouting and harvesting the very same_seeds that the patents recognize as producing sprouts rich in glucosinolates and having high_phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential
according to the patents examples of suitable sprouts are
typically from the family cruciferea of the tribe brassiceae and of the subtribe brassicinae
preferably the sprouts are brassica oleracea selected from the group of varieties consisting of acephala kale collards wild cabbage curly kale medullosa marrowstem kale ramosa thousand head kale alboglabra chinese kale botrytis cauliflower sprouting broccoli costata portugese kale gemmifera brussels sprouts gongylodes kohlrabi italica broccoli palmifolia jersey kale sabauda savoy cabbage sabellica collards and selensia borecole among others
¡¬895_patent col._10,_ll._32-42
numerous prior_art_references identify these same sprouts as suitable for eating
see e.g. stephen facciola cornucopia a source book of edible plants 47 1990 listing` brassica oleracea botrytis group cauliflower.. sprouted seeds are eaten' esther munroe sprouts to grow and eat 9-14 1974 identifying` broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage cauliflower collards and kale'
these references therefore meet the claim_limitation of identifying seeds to use in order to have sprouts with the inherent_properties of glucosinolates and high_phase 2 enzyme-inducing activity
despite the patents admissions about the suitability of particular plant species found in these prior_art_references brassica argues that only specific cultivars of these plant species are rich in glucosinolates and high in phase 2 enzyme-inducing activity
thus according to brassica the prior_art fails to meet the` identifying' steps of the claims because it does not specify which cultivars should be sprouted
however all of the appropriate cultivars that are identified in brassicas patent are in the public domain
¡¬895_patent col._10,_ll._43-65
brassica can not credibly maintain that no one has heretofore grown and eaten one of the many suitable cultivars identified by its patents
it is unnecessary for purposes of anticipation for the persons sprouting these particular cultivars to have realized that they were sprouting something rich in glucosinolates and high in phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential
atlas_powder 190 f.3d at 1348 51 uspq2d at 1947` the public remains free to make use or sell prior_art compositions or processes regardless of whether or not they understand their complete makeup of the underlying scientific principles which allow them to operate
``

the prior_art also discloses the remaining limitations of the claims
the munroe *1352 reference for example recommends that sprouts be harvested between` 3_to_5 days for a sprouted length of 1/big_token__2_to_1__big_token inch'
munroe at 9
photographs of these sprouts show that they have not yet reached the two-leaf_stage of development
id.at 10-13
thus this reference discloses the claim_limitations of germinating the appropriate cruciferous_seeds and harvesting the resulting sprouts prior to the 2-leaf_stage
see ¡¬895_patent claims 1_and_9 ; ¡¬567_patent claims 1_and_2 ; ¡¬505_patent claims 1_and_16
munroe also discloses that these particular_sprouts can be used in food_products such as` soups salads and main dishes' id.at p. 14 thereby meeting the claim_limitation of forming a food_product comprising a plurality of the sprouts895_patent claims 1_and_9 ; ¡¬567_patent claims 1_and_8 ; ¡¬505_patent claims 1_and_16 and the claim_limitation of administering eating the food_product505_patent claims 1_and_16
the munroe reference therefore discloses each and every limitation of these claims of the patents
see also meyerowitz growing vegetables indoors 1990

in summary the prior_art inherently contains the claim_limitations that brassica relies upon to distinguish its claims from the prior_art
while brassica may have recognized something about sprouts that was not known before brassicas claims do not describe a new method

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts summary_judgment that the claims at issue are anticipated by the prior_art
the prior_art indisputably includes growing harvesting and eating particular_sprouts which brassica has recognized as being rich in glucosinolates and high in phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential
but the glucosinolate_content and phase 2 enzyme-inducing potential of these sprouts are inherent_properties of the sprouts put there by nature not by brassica
brassica simply has not claimed anything that is new and its claims are therefore invalid
