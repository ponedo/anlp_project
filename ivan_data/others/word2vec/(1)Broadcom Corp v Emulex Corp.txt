opinion
rader chief_judge
after a trial and post-trial motions the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california determined that emulex corporation emulex infringed broadcom corporations broadcom u.s. patent no._7058,150 the ¡¬150_patent
on appeal the only issues remaining relate to the ¡¬150_patent and the district_courts grant of a permanent_injunction and modifications to that permanent_injunction
second amended notice of appeal broadcom_corp. v. emulex_corp. no._2012-1309 fed.cir
august 10 2012 no._43
upon review of the record this court affirms the district_courts finding that emulex infringed the ¡¬150_patent
similarly this court affirms the district_courts determination that the ¡¬150_patent would not have been obvious at the time of invention and hence invalid
finally because the district_court properly exercised its discretion in granting a permanent_injunction with a well-crafted sunset_period this court also affirms that determination

i
this case concerns digital communication systems with data transceivers capable of receiving multiple analog high-speed serial_data_signals
¡¬ 150 patent abstract col. 2 ll.17-26
once received the analog data_signal needs to be converted into a digital signal through a process called` sampling'
sampling is the process of measuring the amplitude of the analog_signal at precisely timed intervals in order to extract the data carried in the analog_signal
to do so the receiver needs a way to discern the proper rate at which to sample the analog_signal and needs a means for generating a sampling signal having the appropriate frequency
in addition when data is sent through cables over long distances the incoming signal frequency can vary over time
to compensate for such variances receiver circuits adjust the sampling signal to match the frequency and phase of the incoming_data_signal
circuits for aligning and sampling data in this manner are known as clock/data recovery cdr circuits

the ¡¬150_patent discusses that communication_devices with transceivers for transmitting and receiving data_signals were known in the art
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._18 -25
and integrating transceiver_circuits on an integrated circuit ic chip to reduce size and power dissipation of the transceiver was also known in the art
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._26 -28
the circuits typically operate in accordance with timing signals such as sampling signals generated by oscillators
*1329 ¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._26 -41
because there are multiple transceiver_circuits on an ic_chip there are also multiple_oscillators on a common ic_chip
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._26 -41
however the presence of multiple_oscillators on one ic_chip can cause one oscillator to deleteriously influence the operation of another oscillator
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._37 -47
thus the need to integrate transceiver_circuits on an ic_chip and the related need to reduce the number of oscillators on the ic_chip were long felt by those of skill in the art
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._42 -47

to reliably process a data_signal a receiver needs to match its operating characteristics with the characteristics of the data_signal
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._48 -50
to do so it was known in the art to employ a receiver that uses a sampling signal to sample the data_signal at sample times to produce optimal data_recovery and thus minimize errors
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._48 -55
such timing control includes control of the phase and frequency of a sampling signal used to sample the received data_signal
¡¬150_patent_col. 1_ll._59 -61

sampling of high data rate signals also presented challenges
¡¬150_patent_col. 2_ll._7 -9
in prior_art systems as the received data_signal rate increased into the multigigabit-per-second range the difficulty in effectively controlling sampling processes in the receiver correspondingly increased
¡¬ 150 patent col. 1_ll._62 -66
at lower rates the sampling proceeds by making multiple copies of the same high-speed signal and distributing those copies to several sampling circuits operating in parallel
¡¬150_patent_col. 29_l._65 -col. 30_l._6

the ¡¬150_patent solves the problems in the prior_art by using a phase_interpolator to perform high speed sampling of a signal using a technique known as clock and data_recovery
specifically the ¡¬150_patent addresses the sampling problem at high data rates by using four parallel_data_paths each operating at a quarter of the rate of the incoming_data_signal
¡¬150_patent_col. 31_ll._10 -37
further to solve the problems related to the presence of multiple_oscillators on an ic_chip the ¡¬150_patent eliminates the need for multiple_oscillators by` advantageously' using a single master oscillator` in a multiple receiver' environment on an ic_chip
¡¬150_patent_col. 3_ll._22 -40

the invention thus relies on a single master oscillator because the phase_interpolator not the oscillator tunes the phase and frequency of the sampling signal
¡¬150_patent_col. 3_ll._22 -25
instead of changing the oscillator frequency the ¡¬150_patent discloses adjusting the phase of the sampling signal forward or backward so that the sampling rate i.e. the number of rising edges per unit time matches the data rate
¡¬150_patent_col. 23_ll._15 -41
for a change in phase to cause the same ultimate result as a change in frequency the phase must be continually` rotated' at a specific rate-otherwise the sampling signal will not keep up with the desired sampling frequency
¡¬150_patent_col. 23_ll._17 -55

claim 8 the only claim at issue recites

8
a communication device configured to receive multiple serial data signals comprising a master timing generator adapted to generate a master timing signal ; multiple receive-lanes each configured to receive an associated one of the multiple_serial_data_signals each receive-lane including
a phase_interpolator adapted to produce a sampling signal having an interpolated_phase and
a data_path adapted to sample and quantize the associated serial_data_signal *1330 in accordance with the sampling signal ; and
an interpolator_control_module coupled to each receive-lane the interpolator_control_module being adapted to cause the phase_interpolator in each receive-lane to rotate the interpolated_phase of the sampling signal in the receive-lane at a rate corresponding to a frequency_offset between the sampling signal and the serial_data_signal associated with the receive-lane so as to reduce the frequency_offset between the sampling signal and the serial_data_signal
¡¬150_patent_col. 38_l._53 -col. 39_l._5
thus claim 8 recites a communication_device with` multiple receive-lanes each configured to receive an associated one of the multiple_serial_data_signals'
¡¬150_patent_claim 8
each receiving lane has a data_path-a path for the analog_signal to move through the circuit so that it may be sampled and turned into digital data-and a phase_interpolator to adjust the sampling signal to match the incoming data in the data_path
¡¬150_patent_claim 8
claim 8 also recites an interpolator_control_module icm -a mechanism that varies outputs of the phase_interpolators in order to achieve the desired rate of phase rotation
¡¬150_patent_claim 8
further the icm rotates the phase of the sampling signal at a rate that corresponds to the difference in frequency between the sampling signal and the data_signal-the frequency_offset
¡¬150_patent_claim 8

on appeal the relevant prior_art is european patent no
ep0909035 the pickering reference pickering
j.a

pickering teaches` an apparatus for producing an oscillating signal' i.e. a clock and` devices for synchronising an output signal with an input signal'
j.a
218
pickering also discloses` recover [ ing ] a corresponding clock signal at the receiver in order to demodulate the received signal'
j.a
218
the record shows that pickering discloses each limitation of claim 8 except for a` data_path' -also referred to as a` receiving path'
see j.a
245 ; appellants br

in other_words pickering teaches recovering the clock but not the data ; in contrast the ¡¬150_patent teaches recovering both the clock and the data

broadcom filed suit in the central_district of california in september 2009 asserting infringement of ten patents
broadcom then amended the complaint to add an eleventh patent-the ¡¬150_patent and later a twelfth patent was added through consolidation of lawsuits
six patents including the ¡¬150_patent remained in the case at the time of a fourteen-day jury_trial which was held from september 20 2011-october 12 2011
at the close of evidence broadcom moved for jmol on the issue of infringement of the ¡¬150_patent ; emulex similarly moved for judgment as a matter of law jmol on the issue of non-infringement
j.a
33
the district_court granted broadcoms motion and ruled as a matter of law that emulex infringes the ¡¬150_patent
j.a
32 35 ; see j.a
1179
the jury subsequently found that emulex had not shown the invention of the patent would have been obvious that broadcom should receive $ 387,922 in damages for the infringement and that emulexs infringement was not willful
j.a
1178-81

at a post-trial hearing the district_court denied emulexs renewed motion for jmol on the issue of infringement which turned on whether the accused products` reduced the offset between the sampling signal and the data_signal all of the time or only some of the time'
j.a
35
the district_court found that emulexs expert dr._nikolic had conceded that the accused device` reduced the offset at least some of *1331 the time'
j.a
35
the district_court also determined that broadcom presented sufficient evidence that the accused device met all other claim limitations
j.a
36
the district_court also rejected emulexs motion for reconsideration of jmol of infringement based on emulexs challenge of the` at a rate corresponding to' limitation which was raised for the first time during oral argument
j.a
37-39
accordingly because` part-time infringement.. is sufficient to establish infringement' the district_court denied emulexs motion and sustained its earlier conclusion that emulex infringed claim 8 of the ¡¬150_patent
j.a
35 39

after trial both parties moved for jmol on the issue of obviousness of the ¡¬ 150 patent
j.a
235
the jury_trial produced factual_findings on obviousness as well as the jurys verdict that the ¡¬150_patent would not have been obvious at the time of invention
j.a
235 243 ; see j.a
1179-81
specifically the jury found that 1 the claimed invention was not independently invented by others in the same time frame ; 2 the products incorporating the claimed invention experienced commercial_success ; 3 the claimed invention met a long-felt need for a smaller more efficient cdr circuit ; and 4 the invention occurred after unsuccessful attempts by others to find the novel solution
j.a
238-39 243-44 1179-81
the jury also found copying and unexpected results but the district_court held that the record did not support these findings with substantial_evidence
j.a
244
finally the jury concluded that the level of ordinary_skill was` [ a ] n electrical_engineer with at least a bachelors degree in electrical_engineering and several_years of post-graduate experience with cdr circuits implemented in complementary metaloxide-semiconductor cmos integrated circuit devices or the equivalent'
j.a
243 1179

though emulex challenged some of the jurys factual_findings on nonobviousness the primary dispute was over the teachings of pickering
j.a
243-45
as noted earlier the record shows that pickering teaches each limitation of claim 8 except for a` data_path'
see j.a
245
by contrast the ¡¬150_patent_claims recovering both the clock and the data
j.a
748-749
and the district_court found that pickering addressed a different_problem than the ¡¬150_patent
j.a
247-48
emulex argued that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been able to adapt pickering to recover data in the same fashion as the ¡¬150_patent
j.a
247
the district_court however determined that emulex had not proved this invalidity theory by clear and convincing_evidence
j.a
247
thus the district_court held that claim 8 would not have been obvious at the time of invention
j.a
248

the district_court also made several factual_findings leading up to the entry of an injunction on april_3,_2012 against emulex
j.a
1-9
the district_court applied the four-factor_test in ebay inc. v. mercexchange llc 547_u.s._388 391 126_s.ct._1837 164_l.ed.2d_641_(2006)
first the district_court concluded that broadcom suffered irreparable_harm and was likely to continue to do so because of evidence that emulex achieved design_wins and market_share gains at broadcoms expense
j.a
16-20
second the district_court concluded that money_damages would be inadequate to compensate broadcom because of evidence that emulexs design_wins caused unquantifiable secondary benefits to emulex
j.a
20
third the district_court found that the balance of hardships favors an injunction because emulexs sales of infringing products amounted to only a small portion of its revenues
j.a
20-22
fourth the district_court concluded that to balance the public_interest and equitable factors the *1332 permanent_injunction should include a sunset_period to protect certain of emulexs customers from supply disruptions
j.a
22-29

the district_court determined that an eighteen-month_sunset_period starting on october 12 2011 was reasonable
j.a
26-27
the district_court made allowances for` the needs of emulex customers'
j.a
26-27
specifically emulex was allowed to sell infringing products to customers who had` qualified an infringing product' in a specific device and` placed a firm order for production quantities' of the infringing product prior to the start of the sunset_period
j.a
27
and emulex was permitted to make sales` for the specific_customer_device s for which the infringing product has been qualified' prior to the start of the sunset_period
j.a
27
finally the district_court permitted sales to meet` the emergency needs of an end user affecting health of the public.. public safety.. and governmental agencies engaged in national defense'
j.a
5888-89

emulex appeals the district_courts grant of jmol that emulex infringed the ¡¬ 150 patent and that the ¡¬150_patent was not invalid as obvious
emulex also appeals the district_courts grant of a permanent_injunction
this court has jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡±¡± 1292 a 1 c 1 and 1295

iii
rule 50 a 1 permits a grant of jmol` [ i ] f a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury_trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue'

this court reviews the grant or denial of a motion for jmol under the law of the regional circuit-here the united_states_court of appeals for the ninth_circuit
see clearvalue inc. v. pearl river polymers inc. 668_f.3d_1340 1343 fed.cir.2012
in the ninth_circuit a district_courts grant of jmol receives no deference

at trial the district_court granted broadcoms motion for jmol that emulex infringed the ¡¬150_patent
j.a
33 the district_court used the term directed verdict instead of jmol
then at a post-trial hearing the district_court denied emulexs renewed motion for jmol of noninfringement
j.a
35

the issue of infringement turns on the following language of claim 8 the interpolator_control_module being adapted to cause the phase_interpolator in each receive-lane to rotate the interpolated_phase of the sampling signal in the receive-lane at a rate corresponding to a frequency_offset between the sampling signal and the serial_data_signal associated with the receive-lane so as to reduce the frequency_offset between the sampling signal and the serial_data_signal
¡¬150_patent_claim 8 emphases added

the first infringement question is whether the` rate' in emulexs half-rate_architecture` correspond [ s ] to a frequency_offset' as required by claim 8
the accused devices` half-rate' architecture uses two parallel_data_paths that take turns sampling the same data_signal
j.a
638
by using two data_paths each data_path only *1333 needs to sample at half the frequency of the incoming_data_signal
j.a
638
emulex argues that` corresponding to' in claim 8 limits it to full_rate_architecture and would not cover half-rate_architecture
appellants br
32

the record especially the intrinsic evidence of the patents meaning does not support emulexs argument
the claim language itself does not necessitate that` corresponding to' limits claim 8 to full_rate_architecture
indeed the claim does not use language of equation but of correspondence a much broader concept
moreover the record does not contain evidence that the patentee acted as his own lexicographer to define` corresponding to' as` equal to'

the specification even more definitively addresses this issue
the specification states that the` sampling frequency [ ] and serial_data_signal frequency [ ] need to be related to one another but not necessarily equal to one another'
¡¬150_patent_col. 26_ll._4 -13 emphases added
also the specification teaches as one example a quarterrate_architecture
¡¬150_patent_col. 31_ll._19 -41
consequently limiting claim 8 to full_rate_architecture as suggested by emulex would improperly exclude a disclosed embodiment i.e. the quarter-rate_architecture
this court has clarified that an interpretation which` excludes a [ disclosed ] embodiment from the scope of the claim is rarely if ever correct'
accent pkg. inc. v. leggett & platt inc. 707_f.3d_1318 1326 fed.cir.2013 ; see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1312-13 fed.cir.2005 en banc
thus the specification shows that the` corresponding to' claim term does not limit the invention to full_rate_architecture

thus because emulexs argument rests on the incorrect notion that the` corresponding to' language limits claim 8 to full_rate_architecture this court confirms the district_courts ruling that the record shows that emulex meets this limitation by employing half-rate_architecture in its accused products
see j.a
39

emulex also contests the sufficiency of evidence to support the trial_courts grant of jmol of infringement based on the` at a rate.. so as to reduce' limitation of claim 8
appellants br
30
in the first_place this court notes that emulex did not specifically argue at trial that it did not practice the` at a rate' limitation
rather emulexs references at trial to` at a rate' were limited to blanket statements by emulexs expert about large portions of the claim or general explanations about reasons that certain accused products did not practice claim 8
see j.a
602-604
further emulex elected not to crossexamine broadcoms expert on this issue
see generally j.a
496-501

at trial the district_court found that at bottom infringement turned on whether the accused products` reduced the offset between the sampling signal and the data_signal all of the time or only some of the time'
j.a
35
importantly the district_court found that emulexs expert dr._nikolic conceded that the accused device` reduced the offset at least some of the time'
j.a
640 ; see oral argument at 1:19-1:48 broadcom_corp. v. emulex_corp. no._2012-1309 available at http // www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/12-1309/all
it is well settled that an accused device that` sometimes but not always embodies a claim [ ] nonetheless infringes'
bell commc'ns research inc. v. vitalink commc'ns corp. 55_f.3d_615 622-23 fed.cir.1995
accordingly this court affirms the district_courts grant of jmol that emulexs accused products infringed the ¡¬150_patent and denial of emulexs jmol of noninfringement

*1334 iv
obviousness is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact
an analysis of obviousness must be based on several factual inquiries 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art at the time the invention was made ; and 4 objective evidence of nonobviousness if any
in re kubin 561_f.3d_1351 1355 fed.cir.2009 ; see also graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
based on the underlying fact findings whether a claimed invention would have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a is a question of law reviewed de novo
power-one inc. v. artesyn techs. inc. 599_f.3d_1343 1351 fed.cir.2010
underlying factual_findings by the judge are reviewed for clear_error
id
factual findings by the jury receive substantial_evidence review
w. union co. v. moneygram payment sys. inc. 626_f.3d_1361 1369 fed.cir.2010
because the ¡¬150_patent is presumed valid to prevail on its motion for jmol emulex needed to prove that the ¡¬150_patent would have been obvious at the time of invention by clear and convincing_evidence
power-one 599 f.3d at 1351
the obviousness_analysis here asks whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention-an electrical_engineer with at least a bachelors degree and several_years of cdr experience-would have had a reason to modify pickering to include a` data_path'
pickering teaches recovering clock signals and phase synchronization
j.a
245
however pickering neither teaches a data_path nor teaches adjusting the phase for data_recovery
based on the evidence presented at trial the district_court concluded that pickering and the ¡¬150_patent addressed two different_problems-clock_recovery versus clock and data_recovery respectively
j.a
245
while a prior_art reference may support any finding apparent to a person of ordinary_skill in the art prior_art_references that address different_problems may not depending on the art and circumstances support an inference that the skilled_artisan would consult both of them simultaneously
see kinetic concepts inc. v. smith & nephew inc. 688_f.3d_1342 1366 fed.cir.2012 finding invention nonobvious when none of the` reference [ s ] relate to the [ problem ] described in the patents' and no evidence was proffered` indicating why a person having ordinary_skill in the art would combine the references'

specifically at trial the expert_testimony indicated that there was no` motive or reason [ for pickering ] to seek a data_path in order to broaden its function'
j.a
751
pickerings system was described as a` self-contained' system
j.a
751
its task and purpose was to recover the clock data and to phase synchronize the signal-pickerings system accomplished its objective and provided no suggestion to broaden that objective
j.a
751

in addition to solving a different_problem than the ¡¬150_patent pickering does not address the ¡¬150_patents critical` data_path' i.e. the data_recovery function
as the district_court found the record does not support emulexs contention that pickering implicitly requires a data_path
pickerings device is designed to match transition points or cross-over points on a waveform
at the cross-over points there is no data to recover so pickering can not inherently require recovering data
j.a
245-46
moreover contrary to emulexs suggestion pickerings figure 16 shows only clock_recovery not data_recovery
j.a
246
further pickering does not teach data outputs or recovered data

*1335 even assuming that a person of ordinary_skill might have some motivation to add a data_path to pickering the record does not show any reasonable_expectation that this significant change would be successful
an invention is not obvious just` because all of the elements that comprise the invention were known in the prior_art ;' rather a finding of obviousness at the time of invention requires a` plausible rational [ sic ] as to why the prior_art_references would have worked together'
power-one 599 f.3d at 1351 ; amgen inc. v. f. hoffman-la roche ltd. 580_f.3d_1340 1362 fed.cir.2009` an obviousness determination requires that a skilled_artisan would have perceived a reasonable_expectation of success in making the invention in light of the prior_art`
indeed expert_testimony indicated that the proposed combination of pickering with a data_path would not have resulted in the invention of the ¡¬150_patents claim 8 and would not have worked for its intended purpose
broadcoms expert dr. stojanovic testified that combining pickering with a data_path function would result in an` unfunctional circuit'
j.a
749-51
the combination of pickering with a data_path would have caused sampling in undefined zones resulting in undefined values
j.a
750-51
in other_words adding data_recovery functionality to pickering would have defeated the ability to recover data
j.a
750-51

further the record contains evidence of objective_indicia of nonobviousness
objective indicia of nonobviousness are` not just a cumulative or confirmatory part of the obviousness calculus but constitute independent evidence of nonobviousness.. [ and ] enable the court to avert the trap of hindsight'
leo pharm prods. ltd. v. rea 726_f.3d_1346 1358 fed.cir.2013 internal citations and quotation marks omitted
here the district_court averted the trap of hindsight by considering the evidence of the objective_indicia as part of the obviousness_analysis and not just as an afterthought

substantial evidence supports the jurys finding of commercial_success
the products embodying the ¡¬150_patent enjoyed acknowledged commercial_success
but more important the record contains unrebutted testimony establishing a nexus between the claimed technological_advance of claim 8 and the success of the products
j.a
243
in fact broadcom continues to claim technological_advance in products even eleven years after this initial invention
j.a
477
further the technological_advance claimed in the ¡¬150_patents claim 8 was critical in solving the demand for a chip that operates reliably at low cost and higher throughput
j.a

the jurys finding of long-felt but unsolved_need is also supported by substantial_evidence
the testimony reflected that others had tried and failed to develop a clock and data_recovery circuit for use in a multi-lane product
one of the biggest obstacles identified by the expert_testimony was noise-coupling issues
j.a

even broadcoms own attempts and resultant failures support the jurys findings

taken in sum the district_court found that the objective_indicia of nonobviousness` strongly support [ ed ]' a conclusion that the claimed invention would not have been obvious at the time of invention

this court agrees and affirms the district_courts denial of emulexs jmol regarding the validity of the ¡¬150_patent on the basis of obviousness

v. this court reviews a decision to grant or deny an injunction for an abuse *1336 of discretion
innogenetics n.v. v. abbott labs. 512_f.3d_1363 1379 fed.cir.2008
similarly the scope of an injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion
streck inc. v. research & diagnostic sys. inc. 665_f.3d_1269 1293 fed.cir.2012
an abuse of discretion occurs when a district_court exercises its discretion` based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual_findings' or commits` a clear_error of judgment in weighing relevant factors'
innogenetics 512 f.3d at 1379

before assessing irreparable_harm and public_interest the district_court reviewed the characteristics of the market_place
the district_court found that emulex and broadcom competed in a market characterized by` design win' scenarios
j.a
13
their customers were original equipment manufacturers oems -dell hp ibm cisco-who integrated various_component_parts into finished products like servers for data centers
j.a
13
oems hold competitions to determine which supplier will provide a given chip or component for each generation of a product
these design competitions often occur well in advance because integrating various_component_parts together into the oems final_product can take extensive planning and modification
once an oem designs a suppliers component_part into the oems final_product it is very difficult to alter the design of the oem_product
the district_court noted that` [ in ] this kind of market the exclusion has an effect on firms even if they do not have an immediately available product'
j.a
13
the oem essentially commits itself to a single supplier until the next design cycle

the district_court further found that suppliers who prevail in design-win competitions enjoy two benefits beyond merely making sales
first a design-win effectively locks the oem into using the winners component_part and thus temporarily immunizes the winner from competition
j.a
14
second winners enjoy an` incumbency_effect' making them more likely to win subsequent design competitions because the oems familiarity with the winning supplier creates goodwill
j.a
14

the district_court then analyzed the ebay factors through the lens of these market conditions
first the district_court found that the parties were direct_competitors in the relevant product market
j.a
14
the district_court noted that emulex alleged as much in a related antitrust lawsuit and that emulexs senior executives had admitted competition at trial
j.a
14

the record showed conclusively that broadcom had lost market_share to emulex
j.a
17
the trial_court also noted that requiring a` precise product-by-product replacement is too narrow and ignores th [ e ] true scope of competition in the market_place'
j.a
17
finally the district_court emphasized that broadcom had never licensed the ¡¬150_patent individually ; and broadcom only licensed the ¡¬150_patent where some pressing reason to do so existed such as avoiding litigation by completing a cross-licensing deal
j.a
18-19

in light of these findings the district_court concluded that broadcom received an irreparable_harm from the infringement
the district_court also determined that money_damages were inadequate to compensate broadcom largely due to incumbency_effects from the design-win market conditions
j.a
20
accordingly the district_court entered an injunction but provided an eighteen-month_sunset_period ending in april 2013 for certain existing accused products including be2 and be3
j.a
24-28
emulex had already` won' these products so immediately enjoining their sale would have penalized the oems and disrupted the supply of servers with no corresponding benefit to broadcom
j.a
27-28

*1337 relying primarily on apple inc. v. samsung electronics co. 678_f.3d_1314_(fed.cir.2012) emulex argues that the district_court abused its discretion in granting the injunction
emulex argues a lack of irreparable_harm because there was no link between emulexs and broadcoms market_share changes and there was no causal_nexus` show [ ing ] that the infringement caused harm in the first_place'
appellants reply br
28 quoting apple 678 f.3d at 1324
specifically emulex contends that broadcom has shown no evidence of demand for the features claimed in the ¡¬150_patent and the patented_feature is only a` small' component of the infringing products
id.at 28-29

in apple the district_court found that there was considerable evidence that the patented_feature was not a determinative factor in sales and that the alleged infringement` at most' caused an` insignificant amount of lost sales'
apple 678 f.3d at 1324
consequently in those specific circumstances this court affirmed the district_court and agreed that a showing of a causal_nexus between infringement and the alleged harm was required to show irreparable_harm it is necessary to show that the infringement caused harm in the first_place
sales lost to an infringing product can not irreparably harm a patentee if consumers buy that product for reasons other than the patented_feature
if the patented_feature does not drive the demand for the product sales would be lost even if the offending feature were absent from the accused product
id

however contrary to emulexs assertions the evidence here shows that the infringement did cause the harm
emulex and broadcom were competitors in a` design_wins' market which is fundamentally different from the market in apple
in a design_wins market the sales are` design_wins' not a steady flow of discrete product sales as in apple
further this market has a limited set of customers e.g. the four` tier one' oems
j.a
2436
and once a supplier is chosen to meet the needs of a new product line the suppliers component is essentially designed into the oem_product for its life cycle
j.a
2438-39
finally in a design_wins market there is an incumbency_effect which enhances a winning suppliers ability to successfully compete in successive design competitions
j.a
2439-40
all of these characteristics contrast the market in apple where there were discrete sales to numerous consumers

because of these market characteristics the district_court properly concluded that broadcoms` exclusion from a fair_opportunity to compete for design_wins constitutes irreparable_harm'
j.a
16
the evidence showed that broadcom lost market_share as a result of emulexs competition-a clear measure of competition and harm
j.a
2625-26
moreover the incumbency_effect compounded these ramifications because broadcom and emulex competed for design_wins from a limited number of tier one oems
j.a
2436 2590
further the undisputed evidence at trial linked the claimed invention of the ¡¬150_patent to the success of the products incorporating it
j.a
752
as direct_competitors in a limited market broadcoms harm was clearly linked to emulexs infringement of broadcoms patent property_rights
douglas_dynamics llc v. buyers_prods co. 717_f.3d_1336 1345 fed.cir.2013` where two companies are in competition against one another the patentee suffers the harm-often irreparable-of being forced to compete against products that incorporate and infringe its own patented inventions'

furthermore emulex is more than just a likely infringer as was the accused infringer *1338 in apple-emulex is an adjudicated infringer
see apple 678 f.3d at 1323 citing winter v. natural res
def
council inc. 555_u.s._7 20 129_s.ct._365 172_l.ed.2d_249_(2008)` a plaintiff seeking a preliminary_injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits that he is likely to suffer irreparable_harm..'
broadcom has shown-not that it is likely to succeed on the merits and likely to suffer irreparable_harm-but that it in fact has succeeded on the merits and has suffered irreparable_harm
thus the balancing in apple was done in the context of a preliminary_injunction not a permanent_injunction
in this case the district_court properly acknowledged the import of an adjudicated harm and broadcoms entitlement to a permanent_injunction
j.a
32 35

the courts have a long history of remedying trespass on property_rights-including patent rights-by removing the trespasser
see e.g. presidio components inc. v. am
tech
ceramics corp. 702_f.3d_1351 1362 fed.cir.2012
this history of removal stems from a constitutional and statutory grant to exclude others from ones property
u.s. const
art
i ¡± 8 cl
8` by securing for limited times to.. inventors the exclusive right to their respective.. discoveries' emphasis added ; 35 u.s.c.¡± 154 a 1` every patent shall contain.. a grant to the patentee.. of the right to exclude others from making using offering for sale or selling the invention..' emphasis added

however in the interest of equity and with an eye towards protecting the public_interest the decision to grant or deny a permanent_injunction remains within the equitable discretion of the district_courts
presidio 702 f.3d at 1362
equity dictates a four-factor_test that a district_court uses when removing a trespasser from infringed intellectual property
id
( citing ebay 547 u.s. at 391 126_s.ct._1837
and the analysis by the district_court proceeds under the` long tradition of equity practice' granting` injunctive relief upon a finding of infringement in the vast majority of patent cases'
ebay 547 u.s. at 395 126_s.ct._1837 roberts c.j. concurring
patent property_rights are especially difficult to protect with solely monetary relief because` a calculating infringer may thus decide to risk a delayed payment to obtain use of valuable property' without the owners permission
presidio 702 f.3d at 1362-1363

to protect broadcoms property_rights the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting a permanent_injunction
the district_court determined that broadcom and emulex were competitors and that broadcom lost market_share while emulex gained it-thus broadcom established irreparable_harm
see douglas_dynamics llc v. buyers_prods co. 717_f.3d_1336 1345 fed.cir.2013
the district_court also determined that monetary damages were insufficient that the balance of hardships tipped in broadcoms favor and that the public_interest was served by a tailored injunction
j.a
22
thus this court affirms the district_courts analysis of the factors and exercise of its discretion in granting a permanent_injunction

and in exercising its discretion for equitable remedies the district_court formed a well-crafted sunset_period
the terms of the sunset_period permit continued sales for any combination of` specific_customer_device' and infringing products already on the market as of october 12 2011
j.a
27
the district_court selected the october date because by then` a reasonably prudent firm accused of infringement would have either ceased infringement and/or begun design-around efforts'
j.a
27

*1339 further the district_courts selection of an eighteen month_sunset_period was not an abuse of discretion
the eighteen months allowed for time to remove the infringing product from the market without causing significant downstream disturbance for oems and consumers
and the eighteen-month period is a compromise between the wide range of time estimates in the record relating to the design process and product qualification
j.a
25 30 month product redesign period ; j.a
26 14-16 month product development period ; j.a
27 4-6 month qualification period

the` district_courts are in the best position to fashion an injunction tailored to prevent or remedy infringement'
edwards lifesciences ag v. corevalve inc. 699_f.3d_1305 1315 fed.cir.2012 quoting tivo inc. v. echostar corp. 646_f.3d_869 890_n._9_(fed.cir.2011) en banc
the district_court did just that-it tailored a permanent_injunction to meet unique market concerns with a well-crafted sunset_period
this court finds no abuse of discretion ; in fact this is an exemplary exercise of discretion in crafting a tailored equitable remedy
therefore this court affirms the district_courts grant of a permanent_injunction with the sunset_period

vi
for the foregoing reasons this court affirms the district_courts finding that the ¡¬150_patent was infringed and nonobvious and the grant of a permanent_injunction with a sunset_period

affirmed
