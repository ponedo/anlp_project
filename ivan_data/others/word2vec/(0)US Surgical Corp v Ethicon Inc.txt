rule 36 judgment of affirmance without opinion.- the court may enter a judgment of affirmance without opinion citing this rule when it determines that any of the following circumstances exist a the judgment decision or order of the trial_court appealed from is based on findings that are not clearly erroneous ; b the evidence in support of a jury_verdict is sufficient ; c summary_judgment directed verdict or judgment on the pleadings is supported by the record ; d the decision of an administrative agency warrants affirmance under the standard of review in the statute authorizing the petition for review ; or
( e a judgment or decision has been entered without an error of law ; and an opinion would have no precedential_value
appeals whose judgments are entered under rule 36 receive the full consideration of the court and are no less carefully decided than the cases in which we issue full opinions
the rule permits the court to dispense with issuing an opinion that would have no precedential_value when the circumstances of the rule exist

*1557 the u.s._surgical inventions
the inventions claimed in the420_patent and its continuation-in-part the057_patent are for a surgical_instrument for ligating blood_vessels and other_tissues during endoscopic_surgery by applying multiple ligating clips in sequence

endoscopic_surgery is a procedure whereby instead of opening the abdomen or other body_cavity by incision to provide open access to the surgical_site the surgery is performed by inserting the surgical_instruments into the body through small tubes called trocars
the small size of the incisions that accommodate the trocars results in less tissue damage less pain and faster healing than for traditional open_surgery
in performing endoscopic_surgery the body_cavity is inflated with a gas called an insufflating gas to provide working space
for most procedures today a miniature_video_camera is used to televise the surgical_site the enlarged video image appearing upon an external screen and guiding the surgeon or surgical team in manipulating the instruments through the trocars

endoscopic_surgery was in somewhat limited use for many years having been used mostly for the ligation of fallopian_tubes the surgeon viewing the site through an eyepiece
endoscopic procedures experienced rapid_expansion after about 1989 particularly for gallbladder removal
witnesses disputed at trial whether the expansion was due to the development of the miniature_video_camera or the development of u.s._surgicals endoscopic_multiple_clip_applier

during both endoscopic and open_surgery blood_vessels may be closed and tissues clamped using small` u' shaped clamps called ligating clips
ligating clips are applied by an instrument that positions the clip about the tissue or vessel to be secured and then compresses the clip
when initially developed ligating clip instruments were capable of being loaded with only one clip at a time and required reloading between each application
then u.s._surgical developed a ligating clip_applier for open surgical use that applied multiple_clips in succession without reloading the instrument
this instrument having the brand name` premium_surgiclip' is the subject of united_states_patent_no._5030,226 the226_patent
the premium_surgiclip and the226_patent are prior_art to the420 and057_patent s in suit and were the subject of extensive_testimony at trial

at trial witnesses explained the subsequent development of the instrument of the patents in suit a ligating clip_applier for endoscopic_use that applies multiple_clips in succession without withdrawing and reloading the instrument
u.s._surgicals instrument having the brand name endoclip was the first multiple_clip_applier for endoscopic_use
the instrument is depicted in the420_patent as follows

?
*1558 the instrument is depicted in the057_patent with a different handle as follows

?
-- -- - it is seen that these instruments have an elongated shank that holds the ligating clips and is shaped for endoscopic_use through a trocar
after insertion into the body_cavity a clip is pushed into position in the jaws using controls on the handle and the clip is applied to the tissue to be ligated by closing the jaws using controls on the handle
the jaws are then opened and the next_clip is pushed into position
thus successive clips may be applied without withdrawing the instrument from within the body

claim 1 of the420_patent is directed to the combination of the trocar and the clip_applier each component having defined limitations
claim 1 is the only420_patent claim in suit 1
in combination a a trocar having a cannula and valve_means for sealing said cannula said cannula being adapted for entry into a body_cavity ; b an endoscopic clip_applier having i a frame ; ii an endoscopic_portion defining a longitudinal axis and extending distally from said frame said endoscopic_portion being insertable into said cannula through said valve_means in sealing engagement therewith said endoscopic_portion further including a plurality of surgical_clips disposed in an array and clip closing means for sequentially closing said surgical_clips ; and
iii seal means associated and adapted to cooperate with at least one of said endoscopic_portion and said frame to obstruct passage of gaseous media from the body_cavity
claim 1 the broadest claim of the057_patent also describes the endoscopic apparatus as comprising several elements
the claim_elements are defined in terms of their function as provided in 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 1
an apparatus for endoscopic_application of surgical_clips to body_tissue which comprises a frame_means ; b endoscopic_means connected to said frame_means of generally elongated configuration and extending distally from said frame_means and including i means for storing a plurality of surgical_clips ; ii means for individually advancing said clips to the distal_portion of said endoscopic_means for positioning adjacent the body_tissue to be clipped ; iii means for at least partially closing said clip at least sufficient to grip the body_tissue after the clip has been advanced distally to said distal_portion of said endoscopic_means ; and
iv gaseous_sealing_means
claim 2 of the057_patent specifies the use of silicon_grease as the gaseous_sealing_means of clause iv and claim 7 is directed to a disposable device as in claim 1

ethicons defense that the claims are invalid for obviousness was based on the ground that u.s._surgical had merely adapted to endoscopic_use its own prior_art_multiple_clip_applier the premium_surgiclip of the226_patent by known and routine_adaptation
*1559 thus ethicon presented evidence and argument that u.s._surgical had simply elongated the body of its prior_art_multiple_clip_applier so that it could be used through a trocar with a sealing_means to prevent escape of the insufflating gas through the trocar
ethicon adduced extensive evidence that such adaptation was well known to persons of ordinary_skill in the field of endoscopic_instruments
u.s._surgical countered with evidence and argument to the contrary

the jury held by special verdicts that the claims in suit were invalid for obviousness
on appellate review we determine whether on correct instructions of law there was substantial_evidence whereby a reasonable_jury could have reached the verdict reached by this jury
see litton sys. inc. v. honeywell inc. 87_f.3d_1559 1566 39_uspq2d_1321 1324 fed.cir.1996` substantial_evidence describes that minimum quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief
`` ; festo corp. v. shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki co. 72_f.3d_857 862 37_uspq2d_1161 1163 fed.cir.1995` substantial_evidence is such relevant evidence on the record as a whole as could be accepted by a reasonable mind as adequate to support the verdict'
conflicting evidence and argument must be viewed as resolved favorably to the party in whose favor the jury found
the reviewing court must give appropriate deference to the jurys choices in weighing the evidence in deciding between opposing positions and in drawing factual inferences
richardson v. suzuki motor co. 868_f.2d_1226 9_uspq2d_1913_(fed.cir.1989)`the appellate courts function is exhausted when that evidentiary basis [ of the jurys verdict ] becomes apparent it being immaterial that the court might draw a contrary inference or feel that another conclusion is more reasonable

the prior art
as we have remarked ethicons position was that u.s._surgical had simply elongated its prior_art multiple ligating instrument so that it could be inserted through a trocar and used known endoscopic sealing mechanisms to inhibit escape of the insufflating gas through the trocar
expert witnesses testified that these modifications were well known to persons of ordinary_skill in the art of endoscopic_instruments
the witnesses presented several prior_art patents and exhibited many actual instruments all having the common endoscopic characteristics of an elongated_body and sealable engagement with the trocar

the district_court mentioned in the opinion accompanying the denial of post-trial motions that u.s._surgicals technical_expert testified that there were approximately forty different prior_art_multiple_clip_appliers for conventional open_surgery
he testified that at least four of them-the premium_surgiclip of the226_patent and the multiple_clip_appliers shown in the montgomery patent the peters patent and the lachakar patent-embodied all of the elements of the420/'057 claims except for the elongated_body and sealing_means
he testified that an elongated_body and sealing_means are characteristics of all endoscopic surgical_instruments
in evidence were a variety of actual instruments for endoscopic_surgery all having these characteristics
these endoscopic_instruments included graspers scissors dissectors and single_clip_appliers
all had an elongated_body and were adapted for sealing engagement with the trocar

also in evidence were references describing prior endoscopic devices for the application of multiple_fasteners other than ligating clips
u.s. patent no._3870,048 to yoon showed an applier for multiple elastic rings for ligating fallopian_tubes stating that` [ i ] t is possible to load suture ring clips within the applicator in end-to-end series fashion..
this permits a number of clips to be applied during a procedure without the need of having to withdraw the applicator from the surgical_field in order to load another clip into the applicator'
u.s. patent no._4226,239 to polk also showed an instrument for endoscopic_application of multiple ligating rings
the prior_art also included at least one endoscopic *1560 multiple staple applier patent no._4944,443 to oddsen
all of the endoscopic_instruments for applying multiple_fasteners had the common_characteristics of elongation for use through a trocar and most were sealed against escape of the gas through the trocar
several references showed the use of silicon_grease as specified in claim 2 of the057_patent or valves as specified in claim 1 of the420_patent to maintain the seal

the testimony of u.s._surgicals technical_expert that the elongated_body and the seal are common_characteristics of endoscopic_instruments was described by ethicon as a concession of great weight
this evidence was stressed at trial as ethicon pressed its argument that u.s._surgical had simply adapted its226_patent multiple_clip_applier for endoscopic_use and that it was obvious to do so pointing to many other instruments that had been adapted in the same way
u.s._surgical points out that this same expert and several other expert witnesses testified about the difficulties of designing the420/057 endoscopic_multiple_clip_applier and the time and cost involved
we take note of the conflicting testimony and the opposing expert opinions of witnesses for these parties and of the lengthy explorations by these witnesses of this technology and the development and characteristics of these surgical_instruments

in comparing the420/'057 instruments with the prior_art instruments ethicons patent expert testified that the prior_art226_patent was the closest prior_art and that the relevant elements of the structure of the226_patent` were adopted into the subject_matter of the057 and420_patent applications'
ethicons technical_expert pointed out to the jury all of the similarities of the structure and mechanisms between the device of the226_patent and the420/big_token__'057_patent__big_token_s. he pointed to the jaws to hold the clip the pusher for advancing a stored clip to the jaws the grooves in the face of the jaws to receive the clip and the mechanism for closing the clip about the tissue to be ligated
the drawings of the jaws in the226_patent and in the420/big_token__'057_patent__big_token_s show this similarity

?
-- -- - witnesses testified that the operation of the226 instrument and the420/ 057 patents was essentially the same
it was explained that in both the226 and the420/'057 instruments the jaw blade clip_carrier and pusher_bar are all enclosed in a channel_assembly from which the jaws protrude at the end
in the226_patent the applicator is described in the abstract as the surgical clip applicator has a pusher_bar which positions the foremost_clip from a clip_carrier into a ready-to-fire position between the jaws prior to squeezing of the handles together
when the applicator is fired the previously positioned surgical clip can be crimped about a vessel and when the jaws are released a new clip is placed between the jaws for the next firing
a channel_assembly moves over the jaws to close the jaws while the pusher_bar is retracted into the clip_carrier for delivering the foremost_clip from the carrier upon release of the handles
referring to fig._4 of the226_patent it was explained at trial that the pusher_bar 35 moves a clip 33 into the channels in the *1561 faces of the jaws 25
when a clip is in the jaws and the handles are closed the external_channel 38 moves forward over the beveled portion of the jaws which by virtue of their beveled shape are squeezed together by the external_channel thus closing the clip
at the same time the pusher_bar moves back to engage the next_clip in line
when the handle is released the channel withdraws the jaws open and release the clipped tissue and the pusher_bar moves forward positioning the next_clip into the jaws
the operating components are shown in the patent as follows

?
-- -- - in the226_patent the clip_carrier is described as` an elongated channel having a pair of side walls or rails between which the clips are slidably guided a pusher which slides between the rails and a spring for biasing the pusher in the forward direction'
col. 4 lines 45-54
the corresponding assembly shown in fig._18 of the420_patent was the subject of comparative testimony

*1562. ?
-- -- - it was explained that the pusher_bar 143 moves a ligating clip 138 into the channels in the faces of the jaws 135-b
when a clip is in the jaws and the handles are closed the external_channel 133 moves forward over the beveled portion of the jaws squeezing them together and closing the clip

to counter this evidence of similarity u.s._surgical witnesses testified that the420/'057 instrument was not a routine_adaptation of a prior instrument and stressed the long development time and engineering difficulties involved in the conversion of the226 device to endoscopic_use
ethicon challenged these arguments and their factual basis on cross-examination and elicited testimony that the development time related primarily to unclaimed features of the handle

there was testimony about the seal and how it was achieved
in its infringement case u.s._surgical argued that` valve_means' in the420_patent included any known means for sealing the clip_applier in the trocar including valves and gaskets
u.s._surgical argued at trial as stated in its proposed jury_instruction construing this term for infringement purposes the structure for performing this [ valve_means ] function includes all such_structures contained in trocars known in the art at the time the420_patent application was filed
u.s._surgical presented testimony to this effect at trial thus providing substantial basis for the jury to find that the` valve_means' of the420_patent was known in the prior_art
u.s._surgical does not now dispute that the` valve_means' of its420_patent is found in prior_art endoscopic_instruments

in the course of the extensive explanation and comparisons at trial of the prior_art_devices and the420/'057 devices there was no dispute concerning the content of the references or the structures that they described
there was no dispute concerning the structures described in the420/big_token__'057_patent__big_token_s or concerning the meaning of technical_terms or words of art as used in the prior_art or in the patents in suit
the jury was instructed that the technical_terms had their plain_meaning as the district_court mentioned in its opinion on the post-trial motions
u.s._surgical did not proffer a particular` construction' of technical_terms in order to distinguish the claimed inventions from prior_art_devices
neither party departed from the plain_meaning of the words that were used in the claims and in the specifications and in the prior_art
although u.s._surgical has raised on this appeal the issue of` claim_construction' as we shall discuss post there *1563 was no argument at trial as to the meaning of technical_terms or words of art insofar as they concern the determination of obviousness

there was opinion evidence on both sides of the question of obviousness
we turn to the objective_factors for as the district_court instructed the jury such evidence must be considered in the determination of obviousness

objective factors
objective factors assist in understanding how the invention was viewed in its field of endeavor and provide an important practical guide to the decisionmaker
it was explained to the jury that the context in which the invention arose and its reception in the marketplace are indicia of unobviousness and must be considered

witnesses for u.s._surgical testified that the endoclip a commercial embodiment of the420/big_token__'057_patent__big_token_s had revolutionized endoscopic_surgery and made endoscopic gall bladder removal possible
its commercial_success was emphasized and it was stressed that the endoclip was the first and for some years the only endoscopic_multiple_clip_applier on the market
u.s._surgical pointed out that the most relevant prior_art viz
single_clip_appliers for endoscopic_surgery and multiple_clip_appliers for open_surgery had existed for more than a decade before u.s._surgical produced the endoclip for endoscopic_surgery
u.s._surgical presented evidence of the rapid acceptance and adoption of new endoscopic procedures based on its new multiple_clip_applier

witnesses for ethicon testified that the growth of endoscopic_surgery was due to the miniature_video_camera not the multiple_clip_applier
they testified that before a tiny camera was available to televise images of the abdominal cavity whereby a team of surgeons could operate with a common view of the surgical_field endoscopic_surgery was largely limited to ligation of fallopian_tubes a simple procedure performed by a surgeon peering through an eyepiece
according to ethicon u.s._surgicals endoclip was developed for and had its only use for tubal ligation and its later commercial growth was due to the sheer luck of being on the market when endoscopic_surgery underwent its rapid_expansion upon the capability of televising from inside the body

thus u.s._surgical characterized its420/'057 multiple_clip_applier as a pioneering advance in the field of endoscopic_surgery while ethicon described the420/'057 instrument as an obvious adaptation of a prior_art_multiple_clip_applier whose commercial_success was due to unrelated factors
these conflicting arguments were fully presented at trial
witnesses including surgeons supported both sides
the jury was presented with questions of credibility and weight as well as factual disputes as the jury decided whether the inventions of the claims in suit would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention at the time the invention was made
although there were indeed questions of credibility and weight of evidence the jury was not required to choose between alternative meanings of technical_terms or words of art or decide the scope of the claims in deciding the question of obviousness
the factual_findings of the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention the level of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention and the objective considerations did not require` construction' of these claims as set forth in the markman_decisions of the federal_circuit and the supreme_court

in reviewing the jury_verdict of obviousness we review whether the jury was correctly instructed on the law and whether there was substantial_evidence whereby a reasonable_jury could have reached its verdict upon application of the correct law to the facts railroad dynamics inc. v. a. stucki co. 727_f.2d_1506 1512 220_uspq_929 935-36 fed.cir

thus we turn to the law as presented at trial and as instructed by the trial_judge

*1564 the jury instructions
jury instructions are reviewed for correctness with due attention to their clarity objectivity and adequacy taken as a whole
see brooktree corp. v. advanced micro devices inc. 977_f.2d_1555 1570 24_uspq2d_1401 1411 fed.cir.1992` the correctness of a jury_instruction.. is reviewed on appeal to determine whether on the whole the jury_instructions were adequate to ensure that the jury fully understood the legal issues for each element of the case

`` quoting carvel corp. v. diversified management group inc. 930_f.2d_228 232 2d cir.1991

the jury was correctly instructed on the presumption of validity and that ethicon bore the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
the jury was correctly instructed that in determining whether the inventions of the420 and057_patent s were invalid based on obviousness it was necessary to consider the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention the level of ordinary_skill in the art and the objective criteria of unobviousness
the court correctly explained the graham_factors
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459_(1966)
for example in determining the level of ordinary_skill in the art the jury was instructed to consider evidence submitted by the parties to show one the educational level of active workers in the field ; two the types of problems encountered in the art ; three the nature of the prior_art solutions to those problems ; four the activities of others ; five the rapidity with which innovations are made in the art ; and six the sophistication of the technology involved

the jury_instructions included explanation of the principles to be applied in determining obviousness when the invention is a combination of prior_art components
the court instructed that the prior_art must show not only all of the elements of the claimed combination but must contain some` teaching suggestion or incentive' to a person of ordinary_skill to combine the known elements in the way that u.s._surgical combined them in order to prove obviousness the defendants must prove again by clear and convincing_evidence that one of ordinary_skill in the art would have found in the prior_art_references some teaching suggestion or incentive to combine the prior_art_references in the way that u.s._surgical did in its invention
the jury_instructions stressed that the prior_art to be invalidating must sufficiently teach or direct a person of ordinary_skill how to obtain the result reached by the patentee additionally if you do find a teaching in the prior_art that would motivate one of ordinary_skill in the prior_art to make the clip_applier claimed in the057 and420_patent s you must also determine whether there was sufficient teaching or direction in the prior_art of how to obtain or build the claimed clip_applier such that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have a reasonable likelihood of success in making the invention
in other words in order to find obviousness you must find not only that the prior_art would teach one of ordinary_skill to try the combination of known elements but also that the prior_art would sufficiently teach or direct one of ordinary_skill how to obtain the desired result
the jury was instructed that in determining obviousness it was to consider the claim as a whole and that it did not suffice if the individual_elements of the invention were known in the prior_art the reason you must consider the claim as a whole is because there is no dispute that u.s._surgicals invention is comprised of individual_elements which were known in the prior_art
the fact that u.s._surgicals inventions incorporate or combine elements already known in the prior_art does *1565 not render its patents invalid
patents can be granted on devices that contain a combination of various elements that are well known in the prior_art
u.s._surgicals claim is that it invented the combination of those elements for the first time in the endoscopic_multiple_clip_applier claimed in the patents in suit
the instructions on the law of obviousness occupied eight pages of trial transcript
they were correct in law thorough and clearly stated
u.s._surgical now argues that other instructions that it requested should also have been given and that their omission requires a new_trial
the district_court explained its denial of these requests in its opinion on the post-trial motions

u.s._surgical had requested that the court read to the jury the sentence of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a that states` patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made' accompanied by the instruction that the jury should give no weight to ethicons evidence of` how long or short a time it took to make [ the invention ]' and` how obvious u.s._surgicals invention may have seemed to u.s._surgicals own inventors'
the court denied the request
we do not discern reversible_error in this denial for the rejected instruction was encompassed in the instructions that were given was the subject of expert testimony and was included in the argument
the court did not commit error in denying an instruction that gave weight to one of the several aspects that were before the jury and was reasonably viewed as cumulative in the context of the instructions that were given

u.s._surgical also requested an instruction that the226_patent was cumulative prior_art and thus did not have to be cited to the patent examiner
in its pre-trial consideration of the issue of inequitable_conduct the court through a special master had concluded that the226_patent was cumulative in the circumstances and on the law that then applied in the examination of patents
whatever the relevance of this point to the issue of inequitable_conduct which had been decided in favor of u.s._surgical the226_patent was correctly treated as prior_art in this litigation
the denial of this instruction is not grounds for a new_trial

u.s._surgical also requested the instruction that even if the jury found the absence of the secondary consideration of long-felt need that was` in no way suggestive of obviousness or invalidity'
the instruction that was given on the secondary_considerations was in making these three determinations [ the graham_factors ] you must also consider other surrounding circumstances which are called secondary_considerations
these include one whether the alleged invention was commercially successful ; two whether the alleged invention satisfied a long-felt need in the art ; three whether others were unsuccessful in making the alleged invention ; four whether the alleged invention was copied by others in the art ; five whether the alleged invention received praise from others in the art ; six whether the alleged invention departed from other_principles of the art
in order to determine that secondary_considerations such as commercial_success are evidence of non-obviousness there must be a causal connection between the patented features of the invention and the commercial_success of the device
if commercial_success is attributable to the patented features then it is evidence of non-obviousness
u.s._surgicals requested instruction concerning long-felt need related to the weight to be given to a fact whose existence and significance was disputed at trial
the issue of the objective_factors was complex and hard-fought at trial leaving areas of dispute weight and perhaps credibility
we discern no error in the courts refusal to comment on a specific aspect having instructed the jury on all aspects

u.s._surgical also requested the instruction that prior_art that teaches away from the patented invention is evidence of nonobviousness
that subject was comprehended in the above-quoted instruction that *1566 the jury should consider` six whether the alleged invention departed from other_principles of the art' an argument whose substance had been debated at trial
the refusal of this instruction in light of the full instructions that were given is not grounds for a new_trial

u.s._surgical also states that the district_court should have given a curative instruction to counter ethicons suggestion that the patents in suit improperly hindered competition
the record shows ethicons persistent and improper innuendos
however u.s._surgical reasonably countered this aspect with evidence and argument concerning the purpose of the patent system
review of the record leads us to conclude as apparently did the district_court that this tactic did not prejudice the outcome
see city of new york v. pullman inc. 662_f.2d_910 917 2d cir.1981` the district_court is not obliged to charge every contention made by the parties at trial as long as the charge itself taken as a whole is fundamentally fair'
( citations omitted cert
denied 454_u.s._1164 102_s.ct._1038 71_l.ed.2d_320_(1982)
the denial of these instructions and others offered by both sides was not a miscarriage of justice and does not establish reversible_error or grounds for a new_trial

u.s._surgical also argued that its requested instructions construing the claims should have been given and that the absence of` claim_construction' by the district_court required a new_trial
in accordance with the courts remand for further_consideration in light of markman we have again reviewed the requested instructions to determine whether any instructions that were improperly refused could reasonably have prejudiced the jurys verdict of invalidity

in evaluating the refused instructions we look first at the instructions on claim_construction that were given
the issue was interpretation of these means-plus-function_claims and their application to find if there was infringement by the ethicon_devices
the district_court instructed the jury how to interpret means-plus-function_claim_elements and how to apply these claim_elements to the accused devices as follows now in interpreting the means plus function_claim_elements you must determine the following one what function is called for by the claim_element and
two what structure or means is described in the patent_specifications for performing the stated_function
a means plus function claim is only infringed if one the function of the accused device is identical to the function disclosed in the claim_element of the patent ; and
two the structure which performs that function in the accused device is the same as or the equivalent of the structure described in the patent_specifications
the second of these two steps requires you to determine whether the accused device includes the same structure as described in the patent or its equivalent
you may determine that a structure in the ethicon device is equivalent if you determine that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would consider the structure found in the accused device an insubstantial change from the structure disclosed in the patent_specification
this aspect did not concern or determine validity in this case
however u.s._surgical_states that markman requires the trial_judge to perform the first portion of this instruction that is to determine the function and the structure or means that performs the function and to give a detailed technical analysis for the infringement portion of the instruction ; and that failure to do so fatally flawed the trial

for example u.s._surgical requested instructions for the first element of claim 1 of the057_patent starting with the following proposed claim_construction clause i of claim_element 1b reads` means for storing a plurality of surgical_clips'
this is a means-plus-function_claim_element
the stated_function as i interpret it is to store a plurality of surgical_clips
we observe that this part of the proposed claim_construction merely repeats the words of the claim
the requested instruction then *1567 told the jury what structure was described in the patent_specification for performing this function the structure or means disclosed in the patent_specification for performing this function is a clip_track which holds an array of surgical_clips and a spring to bias the clips toward the distal or far_end of the instrument
this information from the specification resolved no dispute for there was none
next the requested instruction told the jury how to find infringement the same_instruction as in the general jury_instruction that was actually given quoted supra but now drawn specifically to this claim_element in order to find that this claim_element of the057_patent has been met you must first find that defendants accused devices perform the function of storing a plurality of clips
then you must find that the defendants accused devices have a clip_track which holds an array of surgical_clips and a spring to bias the clips toward the distal or far_end of the instrument or equivalent_structure which performs this function
this text again repeated the function in the same words as in the claim and repeated the undisputed description in the specification
the requested instruction then stated that if the accused devices perform this function using the described means or an equivalent means there is infringement
that is the same_instruction as in the general instruction that was actually given but made specific to this claim_element
we doubt that markman requires the trial_judge to instruct as to an undisputed` claim_construction' for every term by simply parroting the words of the claim and then repeating the rule concerning infringement of means-plus-function_claims
markman explicitly recognized that the application of the claim to the accused device was for the jury
indeed ethicon objected to this instruction as an improper attempt to direct the jury findings of infringement

similar instructions were proffered for the other claim_elements
another rejected instruction started with a similar repetition of the words of the claim as` interpreted' by the judge and an undisputed restatement of what these words mean the final clause of claim_element b ii calls for` clip closing means for sequentially closing said surgical_clips'
this is a means-plus-function_claim_element
the stated_function of this particular means-plus-function_claim_element is` sequentially closing said surgical_clips'
i interpret this to mean the closing of surgical_clips one at a time and one after the other
in the infringement trial the issue was not the definition of` sequentially' but the equivalency of the means that was described in the specification with the means that was used in the accused device and issues concerning the clip advancing means
these aspects do not relate to obviousness but to infringement
the additional text of this proposed instruction was objected to on its merits by ethicon as an incorrect application of the law of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6
however this aspect raised no disputed issues with respect to the determination of obviousness in view of the prior_art
the dispute concerning the requested instructions related not to the prior_art but to the accused ethicon_devices

following is another claim_element whose proffered` interpretation' was to repeat the words of the claim claim element a calls for a trocar having a cannula with valve_means for sealing the cannula
the claim_element` valve_means for sealing said cannula' is a means-plus-function_claim_element
the stated_function as i interpret it is to seal the cannula
there were infringement disputes concerning the valve_means and there was much debate at trial concerning the scope of this claim_element as applied to ethicons devices
u.s._surgical requested the instruction that the` valve_means' includes and is infringed by all prior_art valves and gaskets and any other known structures for sealing the cannula the structure for performing this function includes all such_structures contained in trocars known in the art at the time the420_patent application was filed
such trocars contain structures both to seal the cannula when no instrument is in *1568 the cannula such as a flapper-type valve and structures which form a seal between the instrument and the cannula when an instrument is inserted in the cannula such as a gasket
the flapper valve may engage the gasket as in the u.s._surgical surgiport trocar or be separate from the gasket as in reusable instruments that were known at the time the420_patent application was filed
therefore if you find that the ethicon endopath trocar is a trocar having the same or equivalent_structure to the structures i have just described then the accused devices satisfy claim_element a of claim 1 of the420_patent
we referred supra to this requested instruction for it makes clear that validity of the u.s._surgical patents was not grounded on asserted unobviousness of the valve_means and that a reasonable_jury could have so found
the district_court had left to the jury the issue of breadth of the valve_means as it affected infringement for ethicon had vigorously objected to this instruction as prejudging the finding of infringement
in his post-trial opinion the district judge expressed the view that the jury had accepted u.s._surgicals construction of the valve_means since it found infringement of the420_patent claim
we do not reach the issue of infringement
however whether the valve_means was construed as broadly as u.s._surgical requested or quite narrowly as ethicon had argued the variety of valve structures shown in the prior_art was in accordance with the jurys finding of obviousness in light of the prior_art

the markman_decisions do not hold that the trial_judge must repeat or restate every claim term in order to comply with the ruling that claim_construction is for the court
claim construction is a matter of resolution of disputed meanings and technical scope to clarify and when necessary to explain what the patentee covered by the claims for use in the determination of infringement
it is not an obligatory exercise in redundancy
although claim_construction may occasionally be necessary in obviousness determinations when the meaning or scope of technical_terms and words of art is unclear and in dispute and requires resolution in order to determine obviousness in this case none of these rejected instructions was directed to or has been shown reasonably to affect the determination of obviousness

grounds for a new_trial have not been shown
see santa_maria v. metro-north commuter r.r. 81_f.3d_265 273 2d cir.1996` a new_trial must be granted if the court determines thatthe verdict is against the weight of the evidence that the damages are excessive or that for other reasons the trial was not fair to the party moving
`` quoting montgomery ward & co. v. duncan 311_u.s._243 251 61_s.ct._189 194 85_l.ed._147_(1940) ; shatterproof glass corp. v. libbey-owens ford co. 758_f.2d_613 626 225_uspq_634 643 fed.cir.1985` if prejudicial_error occurred or if the verdict is against the clear_weight of the evidence as an alternative to judgment n.o.v
a new_trial may be granted in the discretion of the trial_judge'
( citing fairmount glass works v. cub fork coal co. 287_u.s._474 53_s.ct._252 77_l.ed._439_(1933)

we have not been shown prejudicial_error in the jury_instructions or that the verdict of obviousness is against the clear_weight of the evidence or that substantial justice requires that the trial be voided

the dictionary
during its deliberations the jury requested a dictionary and over the objections of both parties was provided one by the court
u.s._surgical_states this is reversible_error while ethicon states that any error was harmless

u.s._surgical proposes that the jury might have used the dictionary to look up definitions on which it had been instructed by the court or that had been explained by witnesses such as` presumption' or` obviousness'
the jury was instructed as the parties agreed to consider the ordinary_meaning of the language used in the claims
u.s._surgical does not mention any terms that were used outside of their ordinary_meaning
the district_court pointed out in its post-trial opinion that the instruction to consider the ordinary_meaning and the general assumption that definitions in a standard dictionary are common knowledge with which the jury *1569 is charged support the provision of the dictionary

it is generally agreed that the provision of a dictionary to a jury although not favored is not grounds for a new_trial
see wernsing v. general motors corp. 298_md._406 470_a.2d_802 806 1984` it appears to be the near universal consensus that a new_trial is not awarded simply because a dictionary was before the jury'
( citing cases
u.s._surgical offered no specifics as to words whose dictionary definitions may have adversely affected the verdict of obviousness
instead u.s._surgical seeks a presumption of prejudice and an automatic_new_trial

both sides cite united states v. weiss 752_f.2d_777_(2d_cir.1985) as stating the controlling law in the second_circuit and each side argues that weiss supports its position
in weiss a criminal defendant was convicted of mail fraud perjury and rico violations and the jury obtained accounting books without the judges knowledge or consent
although the second_circuit stated that` extra-record information that comes to the attention of a juror is presumptively prejudicial' 752 f.2d at 782-83 the court held that the trial_judges determination that the information had not prejudiced the defendant was not an abuse of discretion and sustained the conviction

u.s._surgical argues that the practice of permitting the jury to have a dictionary would undermine the patentees right to be its own lexicographer and thus constitutes reversible_error
however u.s._surgical does not direct us to any actual or reasonably possible prejudice or any suggestion that the jury disregarded the courts instructions on the law of obviousness or the plain_meaning of the terms used in the claims and the prior_art
instead u.s._surgical argues that it was ethicons burden to establish that the jury did not misuse the dictionary and that since that burden can not be met a new_trial is required
however the holding in weiss was not for an automatic_new_trial
weiss did not divest the trial_judge of authority to decide whether the error in that case viewed as juror misconduct was in fact prejudicial

the district_court did not commit prejudicial_error by providing the dictionary
a new_trial on this ground is not warranted

the post-trial motions
upon post-trial motions the district_court in a 34-page opinion discussed validity and infringement
with respect to validity the court discussed the positions of the parties on the teachings of the prior_art the differences between the prior_art and the patented inventions and how the inventions as a whole would have been viewed by a person of ordinary_skill in that art

the district_court summarized the evidence that the prior_art would have suggested the combination claimed in the420_patent
the court referred to ethicons position that u.s._surgical had adapted its own multiple_clip_applier to endoscopic_use and the testimony that the only significant difference from the prior_art_multiple_clip_applier was the elongation of the shaft and the seal and that these were common to all endoscopic_instruments

the district_court explained its conclusion that there was substantial_evidence in support of the jury_verdict of obviousness of the claims in suit
the court also explained its conclusion that the requirements of a new_trial had not been met that the verdict was not against the weight of evidence that there was not a miscarriage of justice or prejudicial_error during trial or a seriously erroneous result

the motion upon remand
following the remand from the supreme_court to the federal_circuit u.s._surgical moved this court to vacate the district_courts judgment and order a new_trial on the ground that since the district_court had not construed the claims as required by markman either before or after the jury rendered its verdicts there is nothing for the federal_circuit to review on appeal
u.s._surgical_states that it is entitled to a new_trial of all issues of validity and infringement except for the verdicts in its favor infringement of the420_patent and that there was not inequitable_conduct for which ethicon did not petition for certiorari

*1570 ethicon opposing the motion points out that the district_court in its opinion on the post-trial motions discussed the claim_construction that the jury necessarily adopted on the two aspects of claim_scope that were in genuine dispute as applied to the ethicon_devices
ethicon points out that the district_court stated that it agreed with the jurys necessary constructions with respect to the valve_means and the clip advancing means and that the court explained its reasons for sustaining the verdicts based on those constructions
ethicon points out that under markman this court undertakes to perform any necessary claim_construction de novo
ethicon also points out that no disputed claim_construction was material to the determination of obviousness

concerning u.s._surgicals proposed instructions on claim_construction as we have discussed whatever their applicability to the issues of infringement their omission did not prejudice the issue of obviousness
markman did not hold that the trial_judge must always parse the claims for the jury whether or not there is an issue in material dispute as to the meaning or scope of the claims
neither this court nor the supreme_court held that the trial_judge must conduct such a rote exercise on pain of having to retry the case

ethicon had objected to the substance of u.s._surgicals proposed instructions as well as asserting that they were unnecessary
we need not resolve this issue for u.s._surgical has not shown that there are unclear or ambiguous technical_terms or words of art or related aspects of claim_scope whose` construction' as requested by u.s._surgical would negate the verdicts of obviousness
the jury was instructed without objection that the language of the claims was to have its plain_meaning
there was no dispute as to the meaning of technical_terms or words of art as used in either the prior_art or the claims
the difference between the prior_art and the claimed invention is a question of fact graham 383 u.s. at 17 86 s.ct.at 693-94 15 l.ed.2d at 556 148 uspq at 467 and was not overruled by the courts markman decision

u.s._surgical argues that if the district_court had construed the claims for the jury the jury could not have reasonably accepted ethicons argument that u.s._surgical had simply made known endoscopic adjustments in its prior_art_multiple_clip_applier
this went to the ultimate question of obviousness which was decided by the jury upon finding and weighing and evaluating the factual evidence of the graham_factors
u.s._surgical does not explain how any reasonable claim_construction that it requested would have deprived the verdict of obviousness of its support
further markman does not authorize the trial_judge to remove from the jury the factual_findings required by graham

on careful consideration of the substance of the instructions on claim_construction that the district_court declined to give and the instructions on the issue of obviousness all in light of the particular issues in this case concerning the prior_art the claimed invention and the courts discussion in markman we conclude that the omission of the requested instructions did not prejudice the determination of obviousness
the criteria for grant of a new_trial have not been met
see santa_maria 81 f.3d at 273 ; shatterproof glass 758 f.2d at 626 225 uspq at 643 new_trial appropriate when there was prejudicial_error or when verdict against weight of the evidence

conclusion
on review of the proceedings at trial we conclude that there was substantial_evidence from which a reasonable_jury could have held that the claimed subject_matter would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in this field at the time the invention was made
the judgment of invalidity is affirmed

the case was vigorously litigated with extensive_testimony physical exhibits and argument
we have been directed to no unfairness or incompleteness or prejudice in the jury_instructions with respect to obviousness
a new_trial was properly denied
