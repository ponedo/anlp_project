* opinion
*1348 prost chief_judge
this appeal arises from consolidated hatch-waxman proceedings involving the reformulated version of the pain reliever oxycontinthe_r
the appellants purdue_pharma_l.p. the p.f
laboratories inc. purdue_pharmaceuticals_l.p. and rhodes_technologies collectively` purdue' and grunenthal gmbh` grunenthal' asserted a number of claims from multiple different patents against the appellees amneal_pharmaceuticals llc` amneal' epic_pharma llc` epic' mylan_pharmaceuticals_inc. and mylan_inc. collectively` mylan' and teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc.` teva' all of whom have filed abbreviated new drug applications` andas' seeking to sell generic_versions of oxycontinthe_r
the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york held a three-week_bench_trial in the case against teva following which it held all of the asserted patent claims invalid
in re oxycontin antitrust litig. 994_f.supp.2d_367 377 s.d.n.y.2014` district_court_decision`
the court then entered orders of dismissal in the three remaining cases against amneal epic and mylan based on collateral_estoppel
purdue and grunenthal appeal the final_judgment in the teva action and purdue also appeals the orders of dismissal in the three other_cases
for the reasons stated below we affirm the district_courts rulings

background
oxycodone hydrochloride-the active_pharmaceutical_ingredient` api' in oxycontinthe_r-is an opioid analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain
this consolidated appeal concerns four patents associated with the reformulated version of oxycontinthe_r u.s._patent_no._7674,799` ¡¬799_patent` u.s._patent_no._7674,800` ¡¬800_patent` u.s._patent_no._7683,072` ¡¬072_patent` collectively` the low-abuk_patents' and u.s. patent no._8114,383 patent` ¡¬383_patent`

i
the low-abuk_patents
the low-abuk_patents recite an improved formulation of oxycodone_hydrochloride
those patents describe an oxycodone_salt with extremely low levels of a particular impurity 14-hydroxycodeinone` 14-hydroxy' which belongs to a class of potentially dangerous compounds known as alpha beta unsaturated ketones` abuks'
the prior_art method of synthesizing oxycodone_hydrochloride involved three steps first thebaine a derivative of the opium poppy was oxidized to form 14-hydroxy ; second the 14-hydroxy was converted to oxycodone_free_base through hydrogenation ; and third the oxycodone_free_base was reacted with hydrochloric acid to form oxycodone_hydrochloride
the end_product created by that process however contained high levels of 14-hydroxy on the order of 1500 parts per million` ppm'

in january 2004 the u.s. food and drug administration` fda' became concerned that 14-hydroxy was potentially toxic and thus mandated that oxycodone_hydrochloride manufacturers either provide evidence that the 14-hydroxy_levels in their formulations were safe or reduce the amount of 14-hydroxy to less than 10 ppm
even before the fdas mandate however rhodes_technologies-a subsidiary of purdue-had begun researching methods to reduce 14-hydroxy_levels in its oxycodone_api
the scientists initially hypothesized that the 14-hydroxy present in the final salt was leftover 14-hydroxy that had not been hydrogenated in the second step
thus they extended the hydrogenation reaction to completion confirming that every molecule of 14-hydroxy converted to oxycodone_free_base at step two
but the scientists found that after step three-transforming the oxycodone_free_base into oxycodone_hydrochloride-the 14-hydroxy had returned

*1349 the scientists thus shifted their focus to step three
it was well known in the art that an impurity 8,14-dihydroxy-7 8-dihydrocodeinone` 8,14-dihydroxy' was produced as a byproduct of the oxidation of thebaine step one
more specifically it was known that a particular_isomer of 8,14-dihydroxy was formed 8£] 14-dihydroxy-7 8-dihydrocodeinone` 8£]'
scientists did not know with certainty however whether 8£\,14-dihydroxy-7 8-dihydrocodeinone` 8£\' -a diastereomer of 8£\-was also produced during the oxidation step
purdue scientists had previously noted the potential existence of 8£\ but no scientific literature discussed that particular_isomer
through experimentation the scientists determined that 8£\ was indeed being produced at step one and in fact was transforming into 14-hydroxy during the acid-catalyzed dehydration at step three
to remove the 14-hydroxy from the oxycodone_api the scientists added another hydrogenation_step at the end of step three to convert the remaining 14-hydroxy into oxycodone_free_base
by june 2003 rhodess laboratory could routinely produce oxycodone_api with 14-hydroxy_levels less than 10 ppm using the double-hydrogenation_process
purdue and rhodes thus sought approval from the fda and patent protection for their low-abuk_oxycodone_product

the low-abuk_patents continue from application no._11 /391,897 known as the` chapman_application'
the claims of the chapman_application have previously been before us ; we authored a non-precedential decision affirming the board of patent appeals and interferences determination that the chapman_claims were obvious
chapman v. casner 315_fed.appx._294 295 fed.cir.2009 rader cj. dissenting
in that case the board declared an interference between the chapman_application and u.s._patent_no._7153,966` casner'
the relevant claims in the chapman_application related to a method for making oxycodone_api using a hydrogenation_step to remove 14-hydroxy but they did not require that some of the remaining 14-hydroxy be derived from the 8£\ isomer
id
the board compared chapmans claims to the prior_art and concluded that they were obvious
chapman appealed directly to us and we agreed with the board
we reasoned that because the claims did not specify the source of the 14-hydroxy any prior_art_reference that disclosed conditions under which either 8£\ or 8£] converted to 14-hydroxy would render the claim obvious
id.at 297
we further noted that the prior_art_references did just that-they disclosed the conversion of 8£] to 14-hydroxy under certain conditions
id
thus we affirmed the boards decision to reject the chapman_claims as obvious
id.at 297-98

purdue eventually amended the chapman_claims to include the claims now on appeal
unlike the claims in the chapman_application the claims at issue here are product_claims instead of process_claims and they explicitly recite 8£\ as the source of at least a portion of the minimal amounts of 14-hydroxy remaining in the oxycodone_api
in 2010 the u.s. patent and trademark office allowed the claims and issued the low-abuk_patents

ii
the ¡¬383_patent
the ¡¬383_patent covers abuse-resistant_formulations
original_oxycontinthe_r was a popular opioid analgesic which delivered a large dose of oxycodone over a twelve-hour period
in the early 2000s however reports of widespread abuse of original_oxycontinthe_r emerged and the problem began to garner significant public attention
original_oxycontinthe_r was susceptible to tampering because abusers could crush the tablets easily into powder which could then be swallowed snorted or injected for an instant opioid` high'
in 2001 purdue and the fda changed the label of original *1350 oxycontinthe_r to warn doctors about the potential for abusers to tamper with the dosage_form

purdue thus investigated ways to reformulate oxycontinthe_r to deter abuse
purdue initially considered among other ideas creating a tablet that would be difficult to crush and difficult to inject but those efforts were unsuccessful
in 2003 purdue became aware of technology developed by grunenthal that made tablets extremely hard in order to prevent crushing and formed a gel upon dissolution in water in order to prevent injecting

grunenthal first began to research abuse resistant properties for its opioid product tapentadol
in october 2002 johnson & johnson proposed a joint venture with grunenthal using johnson & johnsons osmotically controlled-release oral delivery system` oros' to deter abuse
the oros technology consists of a tablet with an outer_shell that limits the flow of the api from an inner core through the use of a` push compartment' in the tablet
the hard outer_shell is composed of high molecular weight polyethylene oxide` peo' and the` push compartment' expands to force the api through a hole in the outer_shell
but the tablet could still be easily crushed with a mortar and pestle so it was not a workable solution
dr. johannes bartholomaeus who was the head of pharmaceutical development for grunenthal at the time tried to strengthen tapentadols dosage_form by making the entire tablet instead of just the outer_shell resistant to crushing
dr._bartholomaeus thus designed a formulation that contained a matrix of api and peo throughout the tablet
moreover dr._bartholomaeuss experimentation with peo demonstrated that using both heat and pressure to form the tablet resulted in a stronger solid that resisted breaking by a hammer or by a mortar and pestle and withstood a breaking_strength test that exerted 500 n of force

after a series of negotiations purdue obtained a license from grunenthal to use the abuse deterrent technology of the ¡¬383_patent in its reformulated_oxycontinthe_r product
purdue submitted a new drug application to the fda in november 2007 proposing a reformulated_oxycontinthe_r which the fda approved in april 2010
by july 2012 purdue noted reductions in the abuse of oxycontinthe_r and provided that information to the fda
on april_16,_2013 the fda withdrew its approval for original_oxycontinthe_r and stopped accepting andas that proposed generic_versions of it reasoning that reformulated_oxycontinthe_r was available to provide the same benefits with lower risks of abuse and misuse
on the same day the fda approved a new label that allowed purdue to market reformulated_oxycontinthe_r on the basis of its abuse deterrent properties

iii
procedural history
in march 2011 purdue sued teva for infringement of the low-abuk_patents in response to tevas filing of an anda seeking fda approval to market generic_versions of reformulated_oxycontinthe_r
between november 2011 and january 2013 purdue filed similar lawsuits against epic mylan and amneal
in addition in june 2012 grunenthal and purdue jointly sued teva for infringement of the ¡¬ 383 patent
the two teva cases were consolidated and joined with the epic mylan and amneal cases along with six actions involving other_defendants in multi-district litigation for pretrial purposes

in september 2013 the district_court held a three-week_bench_trial in the teva cases.1 the district_court found that the *1351 asserted_claims were infringed by tevas proposed generic_product but it also held that all of the claims were invalid as anticipated by or obvious over the prior_art
district_court_decision 994 f.supp.2d at 377
based on that decision the district_court issued an order for purdue to show cause as to why the actions against epic mylan and amneal should not be dismissed under the doctrine of collateral_estoppel
purdue stated that it intended to appeal the teva decision but it agreed that the district_courts decision regarding the invalidity of the low-abuk_patents precluded purdues claims for relief against the other_defendants
accordingly the district_court dismissed the three remaining actions based on collateral_estoppel

purdue and grunenthal appeal the final_judgment in the teva actions and purdue also appeals the orders of dismissal in the three other_cases
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
a patent is invalid for anticipation under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 if a single_prior_art_reference discloses each and every limitation of the claimed invention
schering corp. v. geneva pharm. 339_f.3d_1373 1377 fed.cir.2003
a single_prior_art_reference may anticipate without disclosing a feature of the claimed invention if such feature is necessarily present or inherent in that reference
id
anticipation is a question of fact which we review for clear_error

a patent is invalid for obviousness` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'

i. invalidity of the low-abuk_patents
purdue challenges the district_courts conclusion that the asserted_claims of the low-abuk_patents are invalid as obvious
those claims recite an oxycodone_api product with low_abuk_levels.2 the district_court found that the prior_art taught that oxidation of thebaine produced 14-hydroxy and that it was well known in the art that 14-hydroxy could be removed using hydrogenation
district_court_decision *1352 994 f.supp.2d at 395-96
the court further determined that the discovery of 8£\ was not necessary to the claimed invention a skilled_artisan would recognize that hydrogenation could be used to remove the remaining 14-hydroxy regardless of the source of the 14-hydroxy
id.at 405-06
moreover the court concluded that the claim limitation requiring that the remaining 14-hydroxy is at least in part` derived from 8£\ [ ]' is a product-by-process_limitation and thus immaterial in the obviousness_determination
id.at 405
finally the district_court found that the secondary_considerations did not demonstrate nonobviousness
id.at 407
purdue alleges clear_error in a number of the courts findings but none of its arguments are meritorious

a
discovery of 8£\ first purdue contends that the court failed to properly credit the discovery of 8£\ as the core of the claimed inventions
it relies heavily on eibel_process co. v. minnesota & ontario paper co. 261_u.s._45 68 43_s.ct._322 67_l.ed._523_(1923) for the proposition that` where an inventor discovers a non-obvious source of a problem and then applies a remedy in response the invention is nonobvious and worthy of a patent-even if the remedy standing alone would generally appear to be known in the art'
purdue br
40
in eibel_process the invention was a machine that could make quality paper at high_speeds
261 u.s. at 54 43_s.ct._322
at the time paper-making machines could not operate at high_speeds without producing wrinkled_paper
id
eibel discovered that the unequal_speeds of paper_stock and a wire in the machine produced the wrinkled_paper
thus he made a minor modification in the existing paper-making machines he increased the pitch angle of the wire so that through gravity the paper_stock would travel at substantially the same speed as the wire and the paper would not wrinkle
id.at 57-58 64-65 43_s.ct._322
the supreme court upheld the validity of eibels patent reasoning that the discovery of the problem-unequal_speeds of paper_stock and the wire-was nonobvious and thus the solution was as well
id.at 68 43_s.ct._322
purdue contends that similarly here the discovery of the source of 14-hydroxy was not obvious so the solution of hydrogenating the oxycodone_salt must also be nonobvious

purdues reliance on eibel_process is misplaced
even if determining the source of 14-hydroxy in the end_product was not obvious that problem did not need to be solved to arrive at the claimed invention ; thus eibel_process does not apply
as discussed above the claimed invention in eibel_process was a machine that remedied the problem of wrinkled_paper at high-speed printing
but here purdue did not claim the remedy of the problem of remaining 14-hydroxy in the oxycodone_api-performing a second hydrogenation_step
instead it claimed the end_product-an oxycodone_api with low_abuk_levels
and as the district_court found identification of the source of the remaining 14-hydroxy as being 8£\ had no effect on the structure or nature of the low-abuk_oxycodone_product
because` [ o ] ne molecule of 14-hydroxy is the same as the next whether derived from 8£\ or 8£]' knowledge of 8£\` did not make hydrogenation more or less effective as a technique for converting 14-hydroxy to oxycodone'
district_court_decision 994 f.supp.2d at 405

purdue also argues that without knowing that the 14-hydroxy was derived from 8£\ a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not know when to conduct the hydrogenation_step or under what conditions to run the hydrogenation to create low-abuk_oxycodone
purdue notes that the prior_art_references were directed to lowering *1353 14-hydroxy_levels in the oxycodone_free_base not the api or salt
for example u.s._patent_no._6177,567` chiu reference' disclosed a method for preparing low-abuk_free_base but it did not teach how to convert the low-abuk_free_base into low-abuk salt
in fact as purdue and the district_court noted chiu completed his method by adding acetic acid to the free_base
in so doing chiu likely converted the latent 8£\ into 14-hydroxy in the final product because 8£\ reacts with the acid to form 14-hydroxy
but again purdue claimed the end_product ; it did not claim a particular method for creating that product such as the use of hydrogenation after the salting step
in fact tevas generic_product would not infringe if that were the case because the teva product is not made by hydrogenating the salt-instead the free_base is purified through two hydrogenation cycles and then is treated with acid to create the oxycodone_salt
similarly nothing in the asserted patents indicates that the hydrogenation_process to remove 14-hydroxy derived from 8£\ must be conducted under different conditions from the process used to remove 14-hydroxy that is derived from 8£]
the issue again comes down to whether it would be obvious to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to use hydrogenation to remove the excess 14-hydroxy in the oxycodone_api
one need not know that the 14-hydroxy was derived from 8£\ as opposed to 8£] to answer that question

b
`` derived from 8£\ [ ]' limitation
purdue next argues that because the asserted_claims require that the remaining 14-hydroxy in the oxycodone_api is derived from 8£\ and because 8£\ was not previously known in the art as being the source of 14-hydroxy the claims must be nonobvious
indeed purdue points out that the reason it added that limitation was because of our decision in chapman where we said the claims were obvious because the claims did not differentiate between the 8£\ and 8£]
315 fed.appx.at 297
the district_court rejected that argument because it found that the` derived from 8£\ [ ]' limitation was a process_limitation and thus immaterial to the obviousness_analysis

purdue says first the limitation is not a process_limitation and second even if it is it should not be wholly disregarded
again purdues arguments fail

the relevant claim language provides an oral dosage_form comprising.. oxycodone_hydrochloride active_pharmaceutical_ingredient having less than 25_ppm_14 -hydroxy [ ] wherein at least a portion of the 14-hydroxy [ ] is derived from 8 £\ [ ] during conversion of oxycodone_free_base to oxycodone_hydrochloride [ ]
see e.g. ¡¬799_patent_col. 34_l._65 to col. 35_l._4_(emphasis_added)
we agree with the district_court that` derived from 8£\ [ ]' does not describe the structure of 14-hydroxy and thus is a process_limitation
the patent specification describes methods for detecting and removing 14-hydroxy without regard to the source
for example the written description defines 8,14-dihydroxy as 8£\ 8£] or a mixture of the two and does not indicate any difference in the resulting 14-hydrodxy depending on the particular_isomer from which it is derived
more specifically there is no suggestion in the patents that the hydrogenation_process changes depending on whether the 14-hydroxy is created by 8£\ or 8£]
indeed even purdues expert testified that` [ t ] he structure of the 14-hydroxy that is generated from 8£\ is the same structure that is generated from 8£]'
j.a
4428
because the source of the 14-hydroxy has no effect on its structure or its removal through hydrogenation the limitation that it be` derived from 8£\ [ ]' can not be a structural limitation

*1354 we also conclude that because` derived from 8£\ [ ]' is a process_limitation the district_court did not err in disregarding the limitation in its obviousness_analysis
we have clearly stated that` [ i ] n determining validity of a product-by-process_claim the focus is on the product and not the process of making it
`` greenliant sys. inc. v. xicor llc 692_f.3d_1261 1268 fed.cir.2012 quoting amgen inc. v. f. hoffman-la roche ltd. 580_f.3d_1340 1369 fed.cir.2009
`` that is because of the.. longstanding rule that an old product is not patentable even if it is made by a new process'
id
; see also smithkline beecham corp. v. apotex corp. 439_f.3d_1312 1317 fed.cir.2006` it has long been established that one can not avoid anticipation by an earlier product disclosure by claiming.. the product as produced by a particular process
`` ; in re thorpe 777_f.2d_695 697 fed.cir.1985` if the product in a product-by-process_claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior_art the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process
``

purdue looks to the exception we carved out in amgen` if the process by which a product is made impartsstructural and functional_differences distinguishing the claimed product from the prior_art then those differencesare relevant as evidence of no anticipation although theyare not explicitly part of the claim
`` greenliant 692 f.3d at 1268 quoting amgen 580 f.3d at 1340
as previously discussed however the fact that the 14-hydroxy is derived from 8£\ imparts no structural or functional_differences in the low-abuk hydrocodone api as compared to the prior_art products
thus the court did not err in disregarding the process_limitation in its obviousness_determination

c. secondary considerations
finally purdue contends that the court erroneously discounted the secondary_considerations which it argues demonstrate nonobviousness
purdue first points to rhodess commercial_success ; it says that rhodes became purdues oxycodone_api_supplier by marketing the low-abuk_features of its product to purdue which resulted in almost $ 71 million in sales in 2010
as the district_court found however rhodes was not successful at marketing its low-abuk_oxycodone_api to any significant customer other than purdue which is its corporate affiliate
the district_court further found that purdue invested in rhodes not because of the low-abuk_features but because it could get oxycodone_api at a lower cost from its subsidiary than it could from an unaffiliated manufacturer during times of high demand
purdue does not persuasively rebut these findings on appeal
thus the district_court did not clearly err in concluding that there was no nexus between the low-abuk_product of the patents and the commercial_success of purdue or rhodes

purdue next argues that the failure of others is shown by the experience of tevas oxycodone_api_supplier noramco inc.` noramco'
purdue claims noramco was unable to obtain low_abuk_levels until 2007 years after purdue discovered 8£\ and only then by infringing the low-abuk_patents
but as the district_court found there is no evidence that noramco tried but failed to create low-abuk_oxycodone_api
instead the record showed that noramco and the fda agreed to a timetable for producing low-abuk_oxycodone_api that noramco adhered to that timetable and that noramco continued to manufacture the higher abuk_products during that time
purdue also argues that long-felt need was shown because although the *1355 fda only made low-abuk_oxycodone_api a regulatory requirement in 2003-less than a year before purdue commercialized its low-abuk_product-the need for low-abuk_products was present long before
that does not however change the fact that there was no pressing need for companies to create a low-abuk_product before the fdas mandate as they were able to continue to sell their higher-abuk_products
thus the district_court did not clearly err in finding that purdue failed to prove the failure of others or long-felt but unaddressed need

finally purdue points to the fact that noramco credited purdue and rhodes with the discovery of 8£\ and contends that such recognition shows praise from competitors
but recognition that rhodes discovered that 8£\ is a byproduct of thebaine_oxidation does not equal praise for the invention-the low-abuk_oxycodone_api
purdue also argues that industry praise is shown because noramco copied its process for creating low-abuk_oxycodone but provides no support whatsoever for that argument
finally purdue contends that the court wholly ignored evidence showing that purdue and rhodes were surprised over their discovery and solution
but again there was no surprise as to the patented product
even if it was unexpected that thebaine_oxidation would create 8£\ it was not surprising that after the fda mandate manufacturers would create a low-abuk_oxycodone_api or that they would do so using the known technique of hydrogenation

we find purdues remaining arguments unpersuasive and conclude that the asserted_claims of the low-abuk_patents are obvious
we thus affirm the district_courts finding of invalidity as to those claims

ii
invalidity of the ¡¬383_patent
purdue and grunenthal also challenge the district_courts conclusion that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬383_patent are invalid as anticipated or in the alternative obvious.3 the district_court concluded that the asserted_claims are anticipated by wo 97/49384 known as the mcginity_reference which later became u.s._patent_no._6488,963
district_court_decision 994 f.supp.2d at 421-26
the mcginity_reference discloses the use of hot-melt_extrusion of high_molecular_weight_peo to create a controlled-release dosage_form for pharmaceuticals
the district_court found that mcginity disclosed opioid_formulations and that it inherently disclosed tablets with a breaking_strength in excess of 500 n as required by the asserted_claims
alternatively the district_court concluded that even if the mcginity_reference did not anticipate the ¡¬383_patent` a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have had sufficient knowledge and motivation to make the invention claimed by the ¡¬383_patent'
id.at 426

on appeal grunenthal contends that the district_court clearly erred in finding that mcginity discloses all of the limitations of the asserted_claims and that the district_court impermissibly combined discrete disclosures *1356 in mcginity to arrive at its anticipation_determination
grunenthal also asserts a number of grounds of error in the district_courts obviousness_determination

a. mcginitys disclosure of opioid formulations and breaking strength
mcginity discloses a variety of therapeutic_compounds to be used in its formulations including` analgesics such as aspirin acetaminophen d [ i ] flunisal and the like'
j.a
135074
grunenthal argues that because the only specifically mentioned drugs are non-opioids mcginity does not describe formulations that contain opioids such as oxycodone
it invokes the canon of construction ejusdem generis-which provides that general terms are construed as referring to things of the same kind as those specifically mentioned-to argue that the terms` such as' and` and the like' should be understood as also referring to other non-opioids
but as the district_court found the mcginity_reference can not be read so narrowly
the mcginity_reference explicitly notes the use of its process with analgesics to treat pain and the words` such as' and the residual clause` and the like' demonstrate that the application discloses a broader group of analgesics than just those listed
moreover the record showed that opioids are a major class of analgesics and that oxycodone was one of the most widely prescribed analgesics at the time
the district_court also noted that the mcginity_reference is directed to sustained-release dosage_forms and credited expert_testimony that the only analgesics on the market in a sustained-release_form at the time were opioids.4 the district_courts assessment is persuasive and not clearly erroneous.5

grunenthal next argues that mcginity does not inherently disclose the limitation that the dosage_forms have a breaking_strength of at least 500 n. according to the district_court the pivotal evidence [ with respect to the breaking_strength limitation ] is a series of breaking_strength tests that dr. fernando muzzio performed in preparation for this litigation
muzzio thermoformed thousands of tablets according to the mcginity_application disclosures
he used a variety of chemical compositions extruder temperatures screw speeds and die diameters
he tested a vast number of the resulting tablets and without exception they withstood forces greater than 500n
in fact muzzio often exerted forces in the thousands of newtons and never had a tablet break
district_court_decision 994 f.supp.2d at 423
the district_court credited dr._muzzios testing and noted that` [ i ] n contrast with [ dr._muzzios ] persuasive *1357 experimental evidence plaintiffs have not put forward any evidence that any tablet produced according to the mcginity_application can ever break when a force of 500n is applied to the tablet'
id
the district_court thus concluded that the mcginity_reference` inherently discloses a breaking_strength greater than 500n because the experimental results indicate unanimously reliably clearly and convincingly that any tablet made according to the mcginity_application would exhibit this characteristic'
id.at 424

grunenthal asserts a number of grounds of error many of which focus on the adequacy and reliability of dr._muzzios testing
for example grunenthal argues that dr._muzzio did not provide api release data photographs after breaking_strength testing or laboratory notebooks for his reproductions of the mcginity_disclosures
but the district_court rejected that argument finding that` muzzio has supplemented his own credibility with abundant documentary support in the form of raw data photographs and force curves' and concluded that grunenthals attacks` do not seriously lessen the weight the court assigns to muzzios vast empirical results and credible opinion on the inherency of a 500n breaking_strength'
id
similarly grunenthal says that dr._muzzio did not perform a torque test on its reproductions which would have shown if the extrusion was being accurately repeated
again however the district_court found that argument unpersuasive concluding that` because torque is not an input or setting in the extrusion_process the lack of torque data does not affect the reliability of muzzios process as a replication of the mcginity_applications process'
id
the district_court credited dr._muzzio with having` recreated the mcginity_applications process fairly accurately and with no material_variation' and grunenthal has shown no clear_error in that finding

grunenthal also points to specific disclosures in mcginity which it argues show that the mcginity formulations do not necessarily have the required breaking_strength
first it notes that mcginity discloses tablets that can be scored-making them easy to break in half-or ground which it contends is the antithesis of high breaking_strength tablets
next grunenthal argues that mcginity contemplates the use of heat or pressure to create the disclosed tablets but notes that tablets with 500 n breaking_strength can only be formed using both heat and pressure
neither of those disclosures however changes the fact that every tablet made according to mcginitys disclosures and tested by dr._muzzio had a breaking_strength of over 500 n. and again grunenthal has not shown clear_error in the district_courts crediting of dr._muzzios testing results nor has it provided any independent testing to rebut dr._muzzios findings.6

*1358 grunenthals last two arguments relate to testing that dr._muzzio did not perform
grunenthal notes that dr._muzzio only tested formulations with the active_ingredient disclosed in mcginity chlorpheniramine maleate` cpm' which is an antihistamine not an opioid
thus grunenthal says that dr._muzzios tests only proved that cpm formulations would have a breaking_strength of 500 n or more not that opioid_formulations as claimed in the ¡¬383_patent would have such a breaking_strength
but dr._muzzio testified that any tablet made using at least fifty weight_percent_peo and heated above the melting point of peo would have a breaking_strength above 500 n regardless of the active_ingredient used
j.a
3462
the district_court did not clearly err in crediting that testimony

next grunenthal argues that dr._muzzio did not perform any testing to confirm that the tablets he made according to the mcginity_disclosures were controlled-release_formulations
grunenthal contends that without this testing` there is no clear proof that teva actually carried out the same process-and made the same tablets-disclosed in mcginity'
grunenthal br
38
that is incorrect
as stated above the district_court credited dr._muzzio with recreating the mcginity_process` fairly accurately and with no material_variation'
district_court_decision 994 f.supp.2d at 424
grunenthal has not shown clear_error in the district_courts finding and can not do so by claiming that dr._muzzio did not conduct an additional test to confirm what the district_court already found-that he properly replicated the mcginity_process
grunenthal also says that without testing the controlled-release_properties of the tablets teva can not prove that the limitation requiring` a controlled release_matrix of [ the peo ]' is disclosed by mcginity
that is also incorrect
teva did not need to conduct any controlled-release testing because mcginity clearly discloses peo formulations with controlled-release_properties
for example in the` field of the invention' section mcginity says` the invention relates more specifically to formulations which have been prepared by hot melt_extrusion of mixtures containing high_molecular_weight_peo and a therapeutic_compound for use in controlled-release drug delivery'
j.a
135067
thus the district_court did not clearly err in concluding that the controlled-release limitation was disclosed in mcginity

b
combination of mcginity disclosures
finally grunenthal argues that the district_court erred by using distinct sections of mcginity and reassembling them into an embodiment to find that all of the limitations were present
see application of arkley 59_ccpa_804 455_f.2d_586 587 1972 noting that an anticipating reference` must clearly and unequivocally disclose the claimed compound or direct those skilled in the art to the compound without any need for picking choosing and combining various disclosures not directly related to each other by the teachings of the cited reference'
for example grunenthal points out that the court selected only` analgesics' from the long list of pharmaceutical categories that could be used as the active_ingredient and then further picked oxycodone which was not even disclosed to find anticipation
moreover grunenthal notes that mcginity teaches that the amount of peo will vary depending on various factors and does not consistently disclose formulations with at least sixty weight_percent_peo as required by the claims
thus grunenthal argues that the court impermissibly chose only those examples that included the claimed amount of peo to find anticipation

these arguments are without merit
the disclosures pointed to by the district *1359 court are all` directly related' and thus there is no impermissible picking and choosing
arkley 455 f.2d at 587
for example in the section providing a detailed description of the preferred embodiment mcginity says [ t ] he invention provides a hot-melt extrudable controlled release pharmaceutical formulation comprising an effective amount of a therapeutic_compound high molecular weight [ peo ].. the [ peo ] therapeutic_compound ratio being in the range from about 99.99:0.01 to about 80:20 % wt
j.a
135802
in that single disclosure mcginity describes the controlled-release_formulation and the use of over sixty weight_percent_peo
it does not specifically say what therapeutic_compound is used but it provides a list of the types of therapeutic_compounds contemplated
that list of compounds although in a distinct section of the reference is directly related to the disclosure reproduced above
thus the district_court did not impermissibly combine distinct disclosures in mcginity to arrive at the claimed invention

we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the mcginity_reference discloses each and every limitation in the asserted_claims of the ¡¬383_patent
we thus affirm the district_courts anticipation_determination and do not reach the question of obviousness

iii
collateral estoppel
in addition to appealing the judgments of invalidity purdue also appeals the dismissal of the epic mylan and amneal_actions with respect to the low-abuk_patents
on appeal from orders of dismissal due to collateral_estoppel` our role is limited to reviewing the district_courts application of collateral_estoppel not the correctness of the [ underlying ] verdict [ ]'
pharmacia & upjohn co. v. mylan pharm. inc. 170_f.3d_1373 1380 fed.cir.1999
before the district_court purdue conceded that collateral_estoppel applied to the judgment of invalidity as to the low-abuk_patents in the teva case which precluded it from obtaining the relief sought in the remaining actions
purdue also does not present any persuasive argument on appeal as to why collateral_estoppel should not apply
thus we affirm the district_courts dismissal of the remaining actions as barred by collateral_estoppel

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts invalidity determinations as to the low-abuk_patents and the ¡¬383_patent and the district_courts dismissal of the epic mylan and amneal_actions

affirmed

* honorable leonard p. stark chief_district_judge united_states_district_court for the district of delaware sitting by designation
1
before the district_court purdue accused teva of infringing claims 3_and_19 of the ¡¬799_patent claims 30-big_token__34_and_76__big_token -79 of the ¡¬ 800 patent claims 1 4 and 5 of the ¡¬072_patent and claims 1 2 5 7 and 8 of the ¡¬383_patent
2
all of the asserted_claims are product_claims
the asserted_claims of the ¡¬072_patent are directed to` an oxycodone_hydrochloride active_pharmaceutical_ingredient' with low_abuk_levels see e.g. ¡¬072_patent col. 34_ll._57 -60 while the asserted_claims of the ¡¬799_patent are directed to an` oral dosage_form' of low-abuk_oxycodone_hydrochloride see e.g. ¡¬799_patent_col. 35_ll._8 -15
the asserted_claims of the ¡¬ 800 patent are product-by-process_claims ; they are directed to` [ o ] xycodone salt prepared according to [ a ] process' that yields low_abuk_levels
see e.g. ¡¬800_patent col. 35_ll._49 -50
3
claim 1 is the only independent claim of the ¡¬383_patent and recites a thermoformed dosage_form comprising i one or more active_ingredients with abuse potential a selected from the group consisting of opiates and opioids ii optionally physiologically acceptable auxiliary substances b iii at least 60 % by weight of polyalkylene oxide c having a molecular weight of 1-15 million according to rheological measurements and
iv optionally at least one wax d wherein said dosage_form has a breaking_strength of at least 500 n and wherein the active_ingredient with abuse potential a is present in a controlled release_matrix of component c
4
grunenthal says that the record evidence expressly contradicts this testimony as it shows that there were in fact three analgesics on the market in a sustained-release_form at the time and only two of them were opioids
but grunenthal never made that argument before the district_court-it did not cross-examine the expert on this point or otherwise take issue with the accuracy of the expert_testimony
in any event the fact that two of the three sustained-release drugs on that market at the time were opioids is persuasive evidence that a skilled_artisan would understand mcginity as describing formulations that use opioids
5
grunenthal also contends that mcginity does not disclose the limitation that the active_ingredient has` abuse potential'
¡¬383_patent col. 22_l._3
because we find that the district_court did not err in concluding that mcginity discloses the use of an opioid as an active_ingredient and because the record clearly demonstrates that opioids have abuse potential we similarly find that the district_court did not err in concluding that mcginity discloses formulations where the active_ingredient has abuse potential
6
moreover grunenthal incorrectly characterizes the mcginity_disclosures
grunenthal relies on one isolated sentence to support its argument that mcginity contemplates the use of heat or pressure in its process` [ a ] hot-melt extrudable polymer is one that is.. capable of deformation.. under elevated heat or pressure'
j.a
135076
but that sentence merely defines the type of polymer used ; it does not say that the extrusion_process requires only heat or pressure and not both
in fact in describing the actual hot-melt process mcginity says it should be` conducted at an elevated temperature' and explains that the pharmaceutical mixture should be` passed through the heated area of the extruder at a temperature which will melt or soften the peo'
j.a
135077
indeed grunenthals own expert testified that hot-melt_extrusion requires achieving the` melt flow' temperature of ninety-eight degrees celsius for high_molecular_weight_peo
