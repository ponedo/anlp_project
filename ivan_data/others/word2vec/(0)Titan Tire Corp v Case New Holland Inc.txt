opinion
plager circuit_judge
in this design patent case in which the patentee sought a preliminary_injunction we first clarify the requirements for such an injunction
we then determine in light of that clarification and the evidence before the trial_court whether that court was correct in denying the sought-for relief
because we conclude that under the applicable legal standard the trial_court did not abuse its discretion in denying the injunction we affirm

background
appellant the goodyear_tire & rubber_company` goodyear' owns u.s. design patent no._360862` the ¡¬862_patent` which claims a design for a tractor_tire
appellant titan tire corporation` titan' is a licensee with the right to enforce the ¡¬862_patent
figure 1 of the ¡¬862_patent is a perspective view of a tractor_tire showing the claimed design

?
*1375 fig-1
in february 2007 goodyear and titan collectively` titan' filed a complaint for patent_infringement against appellee case_new_holland inc.` case' in the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of iowa
titan alleged that case sells backhoes equipped with tires that infringe the ¡¬ 862 patent

in may 2007 titan filed a motion for a preliminary_injunction to prohibit case from selling backhoes with infringing tires
after the trial_court held a hearing on the motion titan filed an amended complaint adding appellees cnh america llc` cnh' and gpx_international_tire_corporation` gpx' as defendants
the addition of cnh apparently was in response to the statement in cases answer that cnh not case is the corporate entity that sells backhoes in the united states
gpx is the manufacturer of the` easy rider' model tire that allegedly infringes the ¡¬862_patent

the trial_court denied titans motion for a preliminary_injunction
titan_tire_corp. v. case_new_holland inc. no._407-cv-00063 2007_wl_2914513 s.d.iowa oct. 3 2007` preliminary_injunction_order`
the court found titan was likely to succeed in showing infringement and was likely to withstand cases challenge to the validity of the ¡¬862_patent on the ground that the design is primarily functional but that titan was not likely to withstand cases challenge to the patents validity on obviousness_grounds
while finding that the other three preliminary_injunction factors-irreparable_harm balance of the hardships and public_interest-weighed in favor of granting an injunction the trial_court concluded that titans failure to establish a likelihood of success on the validity_issue was sufficient to defeat the motion for a preliminary_injunction
since the trial_court concluded that a preliminary_injunction should not issue on the record before it the court determined that it was unnecessary to decide whether an injunction would be proper against cnh and gpx the parties added to the case after the trial_courts hearing on the motion

titan appeals from the trial_courts denial of its motion for a preliminary_injunction

discussion
a
when a patentee sues an alleged_infringer for patent_infringement and for the purpose of immediately preventing further alleged infringement moves under 35 u.s.c.¡± 283 for the extraordinary relief of a preliminary_injunction the patentees entitlement to such an injunction is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial_court
genentech inc. v. novo nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1364 fed.cir.1997
on appeal a trial_courts decision to grant or deny a preliminary_injunction made after taking into account the relevant_factors will be overturned only upon a showing that the court abused its discretion
id
abuse of discretion is a deferential standard of review that requires a showing that` the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant_factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings'
id

the factors the trial_court considers when determining whether to grant a preliminary_injunction are of longstanding and universal applicability
as the supreme_court recently reiterated there are four` [ a ] plaintiff seeking a preliminary_injunction must establish [ 1 ] that he is likely to succeed on the merits [ 2 ] that he is likely to suffer irreparable_harm in the absence of preliminary relief [ 3 ] that the balance of equities tips in his favor and [ 4 ] that an *1376 injunction is in the public_interest'
winter v. natural res
def
council inc. 555_u.s._7 129_s.ct._365 374 172_l.ed.2d_249_(2008) citing supreme_court cases
we note in passing that some cases state the first_factor as requiring a` reasonable' likelihood of success on the merits.1 it is not clear whether the addition of` reasonable' adds anything substantive to the test,2 but in any event for our purposes the supreme_courts current statement of the test is the definitive one

in this case in denying the preliminary_injunction the trial_court specifically stated that titan had the burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits including a showing that titan will likely withstand cases challenge to the validity of the ¡¬862_patent
preliminary_injunction_order 2007_wl_2914513 at *4
the trial_court also made reference to a requirement that case demonstrate a` substantial_question' regarding the patents validity
id.at *8

in the appeal before us the parties stated the issue as whether case succeeded before the trial_court in raising a substantial_question of invalidity
as we shall explain when the issue is expressed only in terms of whether the alleged_infringer raised a substantial_question of invalidity litigants may err in addressing the proper presumptions and burdens of proof in their case and their arguments may reflect a possible misunderstanding of the applicable law

with regard to the first_factor-establishing a likelihood of success on the merits-the patentee seeking a preliminary_injunction in a patent_infringement suit must show that it will likely prove infringement and that it will likely withstand challenges if any to the validity of the patent
see genentech 108 f.3d at 1364
in assessing whether the patentee is entitled to the injunction the court views the matter in light of the burdens and presumptions that will inhere at trial
see gonzales v. o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal 546_u.s._418 429 126_s.ct._1211 163_l.ed.2d_1017_(2006)` [ t ] he burdens at the preliminary_injunction_stage_track the burdens at trial
``3

at trial as we explained in our recent case of technology licensing corp. v. videotek inc. 545_f.3d_1316 1327 fed.cir.2008 an issued patent comes with a statutory presumption of validity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 282
because of this presumption an alleged_infringer who raises invalidity as an affirmative_defense has the ultimate burden of persuasion to prove invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence as well as the initial burden of going forward with evidence to support its invalidity allegation.4 tech
licensing 545 f.3d at 1327
once the challenger presents initially persuasive evidence of invalidity the *1377 burden of going forward shifts to the patentee to present contrary_evidence and argument
id
ultimately the outcome of the trial on this point will depend on whether in light of all the evidence the party challenging the patents validity has carried its burden of persuasion to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the patent is invalid
id.at 1328

before trial when the question of validity arises at the preliminary_injunction_stage the application of these burdens and presumptions is tailored to fit the preliminary_injunction context
to begin the patent enjoys the same presumption of validity during preliminary_injunction_proceedings as at other stages of litigation
canon computer sys. inc. v. nu-kote int l inc. 134_f.3d_1085 1088 fed.cir.1998
thus if a patentee moves for a preliminary_injunction and the alleged_infringer does not challenge validity the very existence of the patent with its concomitant presumption of validity satisfies the patentees burden of showing a likelihood of success on the validity_issue
see purdue pharma l.p. v. boehringer ingelheim gmbh 237_f.3d_1359 1365 fed.cir.2001 ; canon 134 f.3d at 1088

if instead the alleged_infringer responds to the preliminary_injunction_motion by launching an attack on the validity of the patent the burden is on the challenger to come forward with evidence of invalidity just as it would be at trial
the patentee to avoid a conclusion that it is unable to show a likelihood of success then has the burden of responding with contrary_evidence which of course may include analysis and argument

while the evidentiary burdens at the preliminary_injunction_stage_track the burdens at trial importantly the ultimate_question before the trial_court is different
as this court explained in new_england_braiding co. v. a.w
chesterton co. the trial_court` does not resolve the validity question but rather must.. make an assessment of the persuasiveness of the challengers evidence recognizing that it is doing so without all evidence that may come out at trial'
970_f.2d_878 882-83 fed.cir.1992
instead of the alleged_infringer having to persuade the trial_court that the patent is invalid at this stage it is the patentee the movant who must persuade the court that despite the challenge presented to validity the patentee nevertheless is likely to succeed at trial on the validity_issue

b
in new_england_braiding as part of its exposition on how these burdens operate in the context of a preliminary_injunction the court said the district court can not be held to have erred in deciding that the patentee failed to make a sufficient showing of likelihood of success required to support a preliminary_injunction where the evidence presented in support of invalidity raises a substantial_question although the defense may not be entirely fleshed out..
while it is not the patentees burden to prove validity the patentee must show that the alleged_infringers defense lacks substantial_merit
id.at 883 emphases added

the precise meaning of the emphasized language referring first to evidence presented by the alleged_infringer to support an invalidity_defense that` raises a substantial_question' and second to the patentees obligation to show that the alleged_infringers defense` lacks substantial_merit' is less than entirely clear and leaves room for different interpretations
there are several possible ways a trial_court could understand that language
to begin the trial_court might assume that only the evidence the challenger presents is relevant to the question of whether the *1378 challenger succeeds in raising a` substantial_question' of invalidity and that that evidence alone could be the basis for the trial_court to deny the injunction

alternatively the trial_court could understand its task to involve not only examining the alleged_infringers evidence of invalidity but also considering rebuttal evidence presented by the patentee and determining whether the patentee can show that the invalidity_defense` lacks substantial_merit'
this latter understanding more properly acknowledges both parts of the above quote from new_england_braiding and our cases have made clear that the patentees rebuttal of the challengers invalidity evidence is an important part of the courts overall evaluation of the evidence
see e.g. genentech 108 f.3d at 1364` in other_words if novo raises asubstantial_question concerning validity..
( i.e. asserts a defense that genentech can not showlacks substantial_merit the preliminary_injunction should not issue' citing new_england_braiding 970 f.2d at 882-83
a few cases have focused the discussion on whether the challenger succeeded in establishing a substantial_question of invalidity without emphasizing that the patentee must be given the opportunity to show that the invalidity_defense` lacks substantial_merit'
however the extensive assessment of the evidence on both sides in those cases demonstrates that what underlies those decisions is the necessary balancing of all the evidence before the court
see e.g. e.i
dupont de nemours & co. v. macdermid printing solutions l.l.c. 525_f.3d_1353 1358-63 fed.cir.2008

accepting then that the trial_court looks at both sides of the evidence the evidence presented by the patentee as well as by the alleged_infringer there remains still a question as to exactly how the trial_court is to understand what is meant by saying the challengers evidence` raises a substantial_question' of invalidity
on the one hand a trial_court could understand that phrase to describe a procedural step involving assessment of evidence that the challenger has put forward initially
if the trial_court determines that the challengers evidence is sufficient to raise` a substantial_question' of invalidity the trial_court must then afford the patentee the opportunity to show that the invalidity_defense` lacks substantial_merit'
in other_words the trial_courts determination that a` substantial_question' has been raised by the alleged_infringer could be considered a trigger for the patentees opportunity to respond to the evidence presented by the challenger

an alternative to that way of understanding the phrase` raises a substantial_question' is to see it as a description of the question a trial_court must resolve regarding the evidence of invalidity at the preliminary_injunction_stage after necessarily taking into account the patentees responses
that is it refers to the net of the evidence after the trial_court considers all evidence on both sides of the validity_issue available at this early_stage of the litigation
under this view a finding of a` substantial_question' of invalidity is a substantive conclusion by the trial_court a conclusion that the patentee is unlikely to succeed on the merits of the validity_issue because the patentee is unable to establish that the alleged_infringers invalidity_defense` lacks substantial_merit'

while our cases since new_england_braiding have not always been explicit as to which of these two meanings of` raises a substantial_question' was intended,5 our precedents establish that the *1379 phrase refers to a conclusion reached by the trial_court after considering the evidence on both sides of the validity_issue.6 thus the trial_court first must weigh the evidence both for and against validity that is available at this preliminary stage in the proceedings
then as explained in new_england_braiding if the trial_court concludes there is a` substantial_question' concerning the validity of the patent meaning that the alleged_infringer has presented an invalidity_defense that the patentee has not shown lacks substantial_merit it necessarily follows that the patentee has not succeeded in showing it is likely to succeed at trial on the merits of the validity_issue
970 f.2d at 883

c. even with that understanding in mind there remains yet further clarification necessary to assess the trial_courts responsibilities in this preliminary_injunction setting
first the weight of evidence necessary for a showing of a` substantial_question' regarding invalidity should not be confused with the similarly phrased but quite different test usually known as` substantial_evidence' in the record
this latter is a low evidentiary threshold applicable to review of jury verdicts and certain administrative law matters including matters on appeal to us from the united states patent and trademark office
see e.g. consol edison co. v. nlrb 305_u.s._197 229 59_s.ct._206 83_l.ed._126_(1938) explaining that` substantial_evidence' in the administrative review context means` more than a mere scintilla' and` such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion' ; in re gartside 203_f.3d_1305 1312 fed.cir.2000
it is not an evidentiary test applicable to a trial_courts decision whether to grant or deny a preliminary_injunction

at the same_time the alleged_infringer at the preliminary_injunction_stage does not need to prove invalidity by the` clear and convincing' standard that will be imposed at trial on the merits
see e.g. amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1358` validity challenges during preliminary_injunction_proceedings can be successful that is they may raise substantial_questions of invalidity on evidence that would not suffice to support a judgment of invalidity at trial`
as we have noted the trial_court must decide whether to grant a preliminary_injunction in light of the burdens the parties will bear at trial sometimes requiring the court to make its decision based on less than a complete record or on disputed facts whose eventual determination will require trial
see univ
of tex. v. camenisch 451_u.s._390 395 101_s.ct._1830 68_l.ed.2d_175_(1981) ; new_england_braiding 970 f.2d at 883

thus when analyzing the likelihood of success factor the trial_court after considering all the evidence available at this early_stage of the litigation must determine whether it is more likely than not that the challenger will be able to prove at trial by clear and convincing_evidence that the patent is invalid
we reiterate that the` clear and convincing' *1380 standard regarding the challengers evidence applies only at trial on the merits not at the preliminary_injunction_stage
the fact that at trial on the merits the proof of invalidity will require clear and convincing_evidence is a consideration for the judge to take into account in assessing the challengers case at the preliminary_injunction_stage ; it is not an evidentiary burden to be met preliminarily by the challenger

if the trial_court is persuaded then it follows that the patentee by definition has not been able to show a likelihood of success at trial on the merits of the validity_issue at least not at this stage.7 this decision process which requires the court to assess the potential of a` clear and convincing' showing in the future but in terms of what is` more likely than not' presently rests initially in the capable hands and sound judgment of the trial_court

it is important to remember that however engaged the court may be in the process of determining whether the alleged_infringer has shown a` substantial_question' of invalidity as we have explained it that process does not change the courts ultimate decision point
as the supreme_court and this court have made clear the first_factor to be dealt with in the preliminary_injunction analysis is the traditional one has the plaintiff established a likelihood of success on the merits ?
asking whether the challenger has raised a substantial_question of invalidity in the manner we have described may be a useful way of initially evaluating the evidence but the ultimate_question regarding the first preliminary_injunction factor remains that of the patentees likelihood of success on the merits
the supreme_court has stated that the general rules applicable to injunctions in civil actions apply equally to injunctions in patent cases ; 8 there is no room for making the substantial_question test a substitute or replacement for the established test for injunctions
that test places the burden on the plaintiff to prove likelihood of success

assuming that the patentee has made the requisite showing regarding likelihood of success it still remains for the trial_court to determine in light of that and the other three factors whether as a matter of sound discretion a preliminary_injunction should issue

d. with this understanding in mind we must determine whether the trial_court in this case abused its discretion when it denied titans motion for a preliminary_injunction based on a finding that titan was unlikely to succeed on the merits of the validity_issue
the trial_courts decision turned on the issue of obviousness
design_patents are subject to the nonobviousness_requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 171

our precedents teach that` the ultimate inquiry under section 103 is whether the claimed design would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary_skill who designs articles of the type involved'
*1381 durling v. spectrum furniture co. 101_f.3d_100 103 fed.cir.1996 citing in re rosen 673_f.2d_388 390 ccpa 1982
durling explains that this general principle translates into` whether one of ordinary_skill would have combined teachings of the prior_art to create the same_overall_visual_appearance as the claimed design' id
( citing in re borden 90_f.3d_1570 1574 fed.cir.1996 and that this in turn requires that` one must find a single reference a something in existence the design_characteristics of which are basically the same as the claimed design
`` id
( quoting in re rosen 673 f.2d at 391
once the primary_reference is found other` secondary' references` may be used to modify it to create a design that has the same_overall_visual_appearance as the claimed design'
id
further these secondary_references must be`so related [ to the primary_reference ] that the appearance of certain ornamental features in one would suggest the application of those features to the other
`` id
( quoting in re borden 90 f.3d at 1575 alteration in original

on appeal titan argues that the trial_court erred by failing to identify a primary_reference
while the trial_court did not designate any particular reference as aprimary_reference it began its discussion of the obviousness issue by quoting relevant language from durling
the court then recited cases argument that three different prior_art references-u.s._patent_no._5188,683` the ¡¬683_patent` u.s._patent_no._5337,814` the ¡¬814_patent` and the ram implement maxi-trac i-3 tire shown in the 1980 tread design guide-' create basically the same visual impression' as the design in the ¡¬862_patent i.e.` a tire_tread with lugs that have two bent_rib_portions and an enlarged head that extends over the centerline of the tire'
preliminary_injunction_order 2007_wl_2914513 at *10
the trial_court also considered titans arguments distinguishing each of these references from the design of the ¡¬862_patent
id

the trial_court would have been entitled to consider any one of these references to be a primary_reference
each of these references in particular the ¡¬683_patent and the ram maxi-trac shown below has design_characteristics that are basically the same as those of titans patented_design a tire_tread with interlocking lugs having two bent_rib_portions that extend diagonally in the same direction of travel toward the tires centerline and culminate in enlarged multi-sided lug heads that are closely spaced and extend slightly over the centerline

*big_token__1382_fig._2__big_token a. ?
figure 2a of the ¡¬683_patent
*1383. ?
the trial_court also referred to the` supplemental designs' that were provided by case in two affidavits from a gpx employee
id.at *11
those affidavits include pictures from tire catalogs and annual tread design guides from various years
again the trial_court was fully entitled to consider these designs to besecondary_references even though the court did not use that exact phrase to describe them
the trial_court considered titans argument that none of these prior_art designs appear to have hexagonal lug heads the main feature of the patented_design that is missing from the primary_references
however at least one of those references the bf goodrich silvertown power industrial tire does appear to have enlarged six-sided lug heads and therefore qualifies as a secondary reference for modifying one of the primary_references to create a design with the same_overall_visual_appearance as the design in the ¡¬862_patent

this process first finding a primary_reference in the prior_art and then modifying it with secondary prior_art references to demonstrate the claimed designs obviousness may have a tendency to draw the courts attention to individual features of a design rather than the designs overall appearance
in this respect it is similar to the` point of novelty' test that until recently was used in the infringement side of design patent law
the` point of novelty' test required a trial_court to examine the prior_art and the claimed design identify one or more points of novelty that distinguished the claimed design from the prior_art and then determine whether those points of novelty were included in the accused design a sometimes contentious analysis
see egyptian_goddess inc. v. swisa 543_f.3d_665 670-71 fed.cir.2008 en banc
one perceived problem with *1384 the point of novelty_test was that it might cause the court to focus` on whether the accused design has appropriated a single specified feature of the claimed design rather than on the proper inquiry i.e. whether the accused design has appropriated the claimed design as a whole'
id.at 677

in egyptian_goddess decided after the trial_court in this case had ruled on the preliminary_injunction issue and after the appeal was briefed and argued this court abrogated the point of novelty_test along with all of its various ramifications that had accreted over the years and held that the` ordinary_observer' test is the controlling test for design patent_infringement
id.at 678
that test was first enunciated by the supreme_court in gorham co. v. white` [ i ] f in the eye of an ordinary_observer giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives two designs are substantially the same if the resemblance is such as to deceive such an observer inducing him to purchase one supposing it to be the other the first one patented is infringed by the other'
14_wall._511 81_u.s._511 528 20_l.ed._731_(1871)
by eliminating the point of novelty_test for infringement this court returned the focus of the infringement inquiry to a comparison of the designs as a whole from the perspective of an ordinary_observer while at the same_time recognizing that the background prior_art may provide context for this analysis
egyptian_goddess 543 f.3d at 676-77

this court also stated in egyptian_goddess that` although the approach we adopt will frequently involve comparisons between the claimed design and the prior_art it is not a test for determining validity but is designed solely as a test of infringement'
id.at 678
thus even though this court has reestablished the ordinary_observer test as the controlling doctrine applicable to design patent_infringement it is not clear to what extent if any the doctrine applicable to obviousness should be modified to conform to the approach adopted by this court in egyptian_goddess

we need not decide that issue to decide this case
the trial_court correctly looked to our existing precedents in particular durling in rendering its judgment
based on our review of the evidence and the arguments made by the parties before the trial_court under the test set forth in durling we can not say the trial_court abused its discretion in concluding that titan was unlikely to withstand cases challenge to the validity of the ¡¬862_patent on obviousness_grounds
while the trial_courts conclusion included the statement that case had demonstrated a substantial_question of validity it is clear that the trial_court applied the correct law governing preliminary_injunctions because it accurately set forth the` likelihood of success' standard in the opinion and its analysis demonstrated that it considered and weighed both parties arguments on the issue of obviousness

titan also contends that the trial_court erred by invoking the supreme_courts decision in ksr international co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
titan argues that the particular passage in ksr cited by the trial_court which relates to the` predictable use of prior_art elements according to their established functions' id.at 417 127_s.ct._1727 emphasis added has no application in the design patent context because design_patents do not have functional elements

the trial_courts decision did not depend on the analysis in ksr
to the contrary the court recognized that the application of ksr to design_patents was` new and untested ground'
preliminary_injunction_order 2007_wl_2914513 at *11
design_patents like utility patents must meet the *1385 nonobviousness_requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and it is not obvious that the supreme_court necessarily intended to exclude design_patents from the reach of ksr
with or without ksr we are not persuaded that the trial_court abused its discretion in determining that titan is unlikely to succeed on the merits of the validity_issue

titan raises several other issues on appeal that we need not address in any detail
first titan argues that the trial_court erred by failing to analyze secondary_considerations of obviousness
we decline to consider this issue because titan made no arguments regarding secondary_considerations before the trial_court
see sage prods. inc. v. devon indus. inc. 126_f.3d_1420 1426 fed.cir.1997
titan also contends that a preliminary_injunction may properly extend to cnh and gpx the defendants added after the hearing on the preliminary_injunction_motion
because we find that the trial_court did not abuse its discretion in denying a preliminary_injunction based on titans failure to show a likelihood of success on the merits we need not determine the parties against whom an injunction would be proper
finally titan raises the issue in its reply brief of whether the trial_court erred in failing adequately to communicate its reasoning behind its decision
in addition to having failed to raise the question properly by not including it as an issue on appeal in its opening brief see smithkline beecham corp. v. apotex corp. 439_f.3d_1312 1319 fed.cir.2006 titan fails to persuade us that the trial_court was noncommunicative

it is also unnecessary for us to reach the various alternative grounds for affirmance presented by case
these include its argument that the trial_court erred in finding that titan was likely to withstand cases challenge to the validity of the ¡¬862_patent on the ground that the design is primarily functional its argument that the trial_court erred in finding that titan was likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement case and its argument that the trial_court erred in finding that the irreparable_harm factor weighed in titans favor
nor do we need to address cases argument that an injunction against it would be improper because titan failed to show a likelihood of success that case induced any alleged direct infringement by cnh

we have carefully considered the parties arguments on appeal but we have done so in the context of the standard applicable to preliminary_injunction determinations
we remind that there have been no final rulings on the merits of the case and the trial_court is not bound by its preliminary conclusions
the trial_court will have the opportunity to reach a final determination on obviousness and other issues at trial

conclusion
the trial_court did not abuse its discretion in denying titans motion for a preliminary_injunction

affirmed
