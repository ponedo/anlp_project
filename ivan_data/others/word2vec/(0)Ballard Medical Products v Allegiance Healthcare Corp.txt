opinion
bryson circuit_judge
ballard_medical_products owns u.s. patent nos._4569,344` the ¡¬344_patent` and 4,696,296` the ¡¬296_patent` which are drawn to ventilating and aspirating tracheobronchial_catheters
ballard sued sorenson_critical_care inc. and allegiance_healthcare_corp. collectively` sorenson' for infringement of multiple claims of the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s. on summary_judgment the district_court ruled that sorenson had not infringed the disputed patents either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
we affirm

i
a tracheobronchial catheter of the type at issue in this case performs both ventilation and aspiration of a patients breathing passages
during ventilation the catheter pumps air into and out of the patients respiratory system
during aspiration the catheter uses vacuum_pressure to evacuate fluids that have accumulated in the patients lungs

the two claims that ballard treats as representative for purposes of appeal are claim 1 of the ¡¬344_patent and claim 4 of the ¡¬296_patent
claim 1 of the ¡¬344_patent reads as follows in pertinent_part 1
an indwelling ventilating/aspirating apparatus by which a medical patient is subjected to involuntary_respiratory_therapy and by which fluids from the trachea and/or bronchi are evacuated the apparatus_comprising

* * * * * * normally closed normally internal sealed and internally sterile vacuum control mechanism sealed against external entry of contamination the vacuum control mechanism comprising valve_means.. the valve_means comprising biased normally closed internal seal means means by which the valve may be selectively manually locked in a closed_position to prohibit inadvertent as well as intentional actuation of the valve_means means by which the valve_means may be selectively manually place [ d ] in an unlocked_closed_position accommodating subsequent selective manual actuation of the valve_means means by which the valve_means are manually displaced from the unlocked_closed_position to an unlocked open_position accommodating aspiration of fluids from the trachea-bronchi of the patient along the catheter_tube and across the valve_means responsive to communication of said vacuum_suction to the distal tip of the catheter_tube as long as the valve_means are manually retained in the open_position counter to the bias imposed upon the biased seal means and means which isolate said vacuum_suction from atmospheric contamination
claim 4 of the ¡¬296_patent reads as follows in pertinent_part 4
an indwelling ventilating aspirating apparatus by which a medial patient is subjected to involuntary_respiratory_therapy and by which secretions from *1355 the trachea and/or bronchi are evacuated the apparatus_comprising

* * * * * * vacuum_control_valve_structure comprising valve_body means having fluid_flow passageway_means and valve_means operable within the valve_body means between non-activated and activated positions to respectively prohibit and accommodate vacuum caused fluid_flow along the passageway_means the control_valve_structure further comprising a means biasing the valve_means into the non-activated vacuum prohibiting position b actuator means for manually displacing the valve_means from the non-activated to the activated position counter to the bias means and the valve_means and thus prevents bacterial_contamination within the passageway_means and along the catheter_tube and c means by which said valve_structure is connected to the other end of the envelope

figure 1 below which is taken from the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s depicts the structure of the ballard invention that is the subject of the asserted patents

?
the valve that is the focus of the dispute in this case is labeled 40
the common written description of the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s explains that it is important that the valve remain closed during ventilation because suction would interfere with the catheters ability to ventilate the patient
periodically an operator can open the valve manually which introduces vacuum_pressure into the catheter and aspirates the patients lungs

figures 3_and_8 from the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s shown below detail the structure of the ballard valve in the closed and open_positions respectively

*1356. ?
fig._8
?
when the valve is in the closed_position the actuator 280 and the plunger 286 are in the raised position so that the sealing member 288 which is made of a shape- *1357 retaining highly elastic substance such as synthetic rubber blocks both vacuum_pressure and fluid_flow across the valve_bore 322
to open the valve the operator manually depresses the actuator
depressing the actuator causes the plunger to stretch the sealing member so that the valve_bore is no longer entirely blocked
opening the valve_bore introduces vacuum_pressure into the catheter and draws fluid back through the catheter from the patients lungs
in the absence of manual pressure the elastic sealing member biases the plunger and actuator to return to the closed_position
to prevent accidental opening of the valve which would cause unintended aspiration the operator can rotate the actuator so that posts 302_and_304 in the actuator align with valve_body posts 354_and_356 which prevents the actuator from being depressed

the accused trach-eze device made by defendant sorenson is shown in the following figure taken from sorensons u.s. pat
no._5919,174

?
in the closed_position the plunger of the sorenson_valve is raised so that valve seal 38 is positioned along plane 49 thus preventing any fluid_flow along passageway 51
in the open_position the plunger is depressed so that seal 38 descends into well 53
fluid may then flow through passageway 51 around the shaft of the plunger
o-ring_seal 37 impedes the flow of fluid up into the valve mechanism
while the valve is in the closed_position the cap 15 may be rotated to a position that prevents depression of the plunger thus locking the valve in the closed_position

ballard filed suit against the defendants alleging infringement of claims 1-big_token__20_and_26__big_token of the ¡¬344_patent and claims 4-6 of the *1358 ¡¬296_patent
the district_court held an extended pretrial conference at which summary_judgment and claim_construction issues were considered
subsequently the court issued an order granting sorensons motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement
the court based its ruling on materials the patentee submitted to the patent and trademark office` pto' during the prosecution of the ¡¬344_patent distinguishing the valve of the claimed catheter from various prior_art_devices
those statements the court concluded required that the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s be construed to exclude catheter systems having a valve_structure of the sort used in the accused sorenson_device
the court also concluded that prosecution_history_estoppel foreclosed ballard from establishing infringement based on the doctrine of equivalents

ii
a. ballard first argues that the district_court improperly failed to conduct a detailed limitation-by-limitation construction of each of the asserted claims
according to ballard this courts decision in markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 34_uspq2d_1321_(fed.cir.1995) affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996) required the district_court to conduct a complete claim_construction of the asserted claims before addressing the issue of infringement

contrary to ballards contention markman does not require a district_court to follow any particular procedure in conducting claim_construction
it merely holds that claim_construction is the province of the court not a jury
to perform that task some courts have found it useful to hold hearings and issue orders comprehensively construing the claims in issue
such a procedure is not always necessary however
if the district_court considers one issue to be dispositive the court may cut to the heart of the matter and need not exhaustively discuss all the other issues presented by the parties
district courts have wide latitude in how they conduct the proceedings before them and there is nothing unique about claim_construction that requires the court to proceed according to any particular protocol
as long as the trial_court construes the claims to the extent necessary to determine whether the accused device infringes the court may approach the task in any way that it deems best

nor do ballards arguments concerning the terminology in the district_courts opinion suffice to overturn the judgment
ballard complains that the district_court incorrectly invoked prosecution_history_estoppel to limit claim scope for literal_infringement despite our case law that holds prosecution_history_estoppel to be inapplicable to literal_infringement
see e.g. southwall techs. inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1578 34_uspq2d_1673 1679 fed.cir.1995 ; fromson v. advance offset plate inc. 720_f.2d_1565 1571 219_uspq_1137 1141 fed.cir.1983

it is true that the district_court at one point in its opinion referred to prosecution_history_estoppel in the context of claim_construction
what is important however is the analysis not the nomenclature and we are satisfied that in relying on the prosecution_history as an aid to claim_construction the district_court did not err
in similar circumstances the court in biodex corp. v. loredan biomedical inc. 946_f.2d_850 20_uspq2d_1252_(fed.cir.1991) acknowledged that prosecution_history_estoppel does not apply to the determination of literal claim scope but noted that` a particular interpretation of a claim term may have been disclaimed by the inventor during prosecution'
id.at 863 20 uspq2d at 1262
see also mcgill inc. v. *1359 john zink co. 736_f.2d_666 673 221_uspq_944 949 fed.cir.1984` prosecution history may be used not only in an estoppel context but also as a claim_construction tool`
in this case the district_court held that in the course of the prosecution the patentee disclaimed a particular claim interpretation
the court concluded that because of that disclaimer ballard could not assert that interpretation as the basis for literal_infringement and could not invoke the doctrine of equivalents to reach a device covered by the disclaimer
because the substance of the district_courts analysis was sound we disregard the fact that the court used the term` prosecution_history_estoppel' in an unconventional manner

b
focusing on claim 1 of the ¡¬344_patent and claim 4 of the ¡¬296_patent ballard next contends that the district_court erred in concluding that the valve element of those claims did not read on the accused device
the parties agree that the disputed valve_limitation of those two claims is drafted in means-plus-function_format governed by 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 and we concur
for that reason the scope of the valve_limitation must be confined to the valve_structure disclosed in the specification plus its equivalents
the drawings above depict the structure of the only disclosed embodiment as well as the structure of the accused sorenson_device
because there are plainly differences between the disclosed valve_structure and the valve of the sorenson_device ballard must rely on the theory that the sorenson_valve is equivalent to the valve_structure disclosed in the written description of the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s

an inventor may use the specification and prosecution_history to define what his invention is and what it is not-particularly when distinguishing the invention over prior_art
`` [ j ] ust as prosecution_history_estoppel may act to estop an equivalence argument under the doctrine of equivalents positions taken before the pto may bar an inconsistent position on claim_construction under ¡± 112 ?

cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1457 46_uspq2d_1169 1175 fed.cir.1998 quoting alpex computer corp. v. nintendo co. 102_f.3d_1214 1221 40_uspq2d_1667 1673 fed.cir.1996
statements detailing the shortcomings of the relevant prior_art have often proved useful in construing means-plus-function_claims
for example in signtech usa ltd. v. vutek inc. 174_f.3d_1352 50_uspq2d_1372_(fed.cir.1999) the patentee which had used means-plus-function claim format noted that the structure used by certain prior_art was` incapable' of achieving the desired results of the invention
that was held to be an` explicit disavowal of prior_art structure' which was properly used in construing the means-plus-function_claims
see 174 f.3d at 1357 50 uspq2d at 1375
when a patentee advises the examiner and the public after patent issuance that a particular structure is not within his invention the patentee is not permitted to assert in a subsequent infringement action that the same structure is equivalent to the structure described in the patentees specification for purposes of section 112_paragraph_6

sorenson asserts that in the course of prosecuting the 633,570 application which issued as the ¡¬344_patent the applicant darrel palmer offered an amendment and an inventors affidavit in which he disavowed certain structures by characterizing them as falling outside the scope of his invention
with regard to how his valve opened and closed palmer stated that the prior_art_valves that the examiner had cited were` pressure_valves' while the valve disclosed and claimed in the 633,570 application was a` vacuum_valve'
palmer *1360 asserted that his vacuum_valve mechanism for stopping the flow of liquid through the catheter which is perpendicular to the direction of fluid_flow in the catheter was not affected by pressure through the catheter from either direction
he explained that the prior_art pressure_valve devices in contrast would seal if vacuum_pressure were applied to one end of the catheter but would tend to open or leak if vacuum_pressure were applied to the opposite end

palmer also distinguished his valve from the prior_art_valves based on the type of seal that his valve used to preserve the sterility of the catheter
palmer explained that his valve` uses a static_seal_feature to eliminate bacterial_contamination'
as such it` has no shaft-seal_interface which would if such existed allow contaminants to enter the sterile_interior of the claimed apparatus'
as explained in the written description of the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s when the valve is in the closed_position the elastic sealing member entirely blocks the flow of fluid through the catheter
when the actuator that is built into the middle of the sealing member is depressed the sealing member stretches and permits fluid to flow through the catheter
an advantage of that design the specification recites is that only the interior portion of the seal is exposed to the fluid_flow and there is no access point through which bacteria can travel between the outside_environment and the interior of the catheter
the cited prior_art_devices palmer explained use a` dynamic_seal-to-shaft_interface' which` would allow entry of contaminating bacteria between the valve_body and the shaft into the fluid_flow region of said prior_art_devices'

finally palmer distinguished the prior_art_valves on the ground that they lacked a locking mechanism
his valve he explained could be locked in the closed_position but not in the open_position to prevent the valve from accidentally opening leading to inadvertent aspiration of the patient

ballard asserts that palmers statements distinguishing his valve from the prior_art_valves applied only to the claims 27-29 of the application which were introduced with the amendment in which the disputed statements were made
those claims eventually became claims 1-3 of the ¡¬296_patent which are not at issue in this case
under ballards theory the statements that palmer made in his affidavit and in the amendment distinguishing the prior_art_valves have no effect on claims 4-6 of the ¡¬296_patent or any of the claims of the ¡¬ 344 patent

we disagree
palmer and his counsel repeatedly characterized the control_valve that was described in his affidavit and the amendment as the` control_valve of the present_invention'` the control_valve_structure of the above-identified application' and` the control_valve disclosed in the above-identified application' i.e. the 633,570 application that ultimately became the ¡¬344_patent
indeed through counsel he referred in his statement to` the pending claims [ particularly claims 27-29 ]' which makes it clear that his remarks applied to all pending claims not just claims 27-29

furthermore in prosecuting the ¡¬296_patent palmer noted that` [ t ] he present_invention is.. patentable over the same [ prior_art ] for reasons stated in the parent case'
it was therefore appropriate for the district_court to treat the distinction of the prior_art_valves that palmer made in the amendment to the 633,570 application as applying equally to the related application that became the ¡¬296_patent

because means-plus-function_claims derive their scope from the structure disclosed in the written description and because the two patents share the same written description all of the means- *1361 plus-function_claims at issue in this case derive their scope from the same disclosed structure
for that reason palmers characterizations of the valve described in the original specification of the 633,570 application presumably apply to all of the means-plus-function_claims at issue in this case at least in the absence of some indication that the structure referred to in the means-plus-function_limitations should be construed differently for some claims than for others
nothing in the patent or the prosecution_history provides any reason to conclude that the disclosed structure to which the means-plus-function_limitations refer differs for purposes of the two patents
in light of the identical disclosures of the two patents it was therefore appropriate for the district_court to construe the means-plus-function_claims of the two patents in pari materia

``

ballard cites cybor for the proposition that specific statements in the prosecution_history should not be generalized into broad disclaimers and argues that in this case the prosecution_history disclaims only those dynamic_seals that do not contain means for avoiding bacterial_contamination between the interior of the catheter and the outside_environment
in cybor the court carefully considered the patentees arguments during prosecution and concluded that the arguments distinguishing a prior_art reference did not preclude coverage of any fluid dispensing device that used an external reservoir
instead the court agreed with the district_court that the patentee disclaimed only` a physically unattached reservoir which has independent functionality'
cybor 138 f.3d at 1458 46 uspq2d at 1176
the court emphasized that the scope of the disclaimer must be determined by what` a competitor would reasonably believe that the applicant had surrendered'
138 f.3d at 1457-58 46 uspq2d at 1175
applying that standard in this case the district_court concluded as do we that palmers statements identifying his invention as a vacuum_valve with a static seal had the effect of disclaiming pressure_valves` [ t ] he control_valve disclosed in the.. application is not a pressure_valve
it is strictly a vacuum_valve wherein vacuum_pressure if desired can be applied to either end with the same result' and dynamic_seals` [ t ] he present vacuum_control_valve uses a static_seal_feature to eliminate the bacterial_contamination
it has no shaft/seal_interface along which bacterial_contamination can pass into the sterile_interior'

as for ballards contention that the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s apply to any valve_structure that minimizes the cross-contamination between the interior of the catheter and the outside_environment that functional characterization of the scope of the claims is inconsistent with the statutory provision that limits means-plus-function_claims to the disclosed structure and equivalents rather than covering any structure that performs the recited function
in addition ballards argument is inconsistent with palmers representations before the pto
palmer did not suggest *1362 that his claims extended to any valve_structure that served the function of preventing or inhibiting cross-contamination
instead he stated that his vacuum_control_valve` uses a static_seal_feature to eliminate the bacterial_contamination'
other structures whether or not they served the same function were thereby excluded

finally ballard contends that even if the claims of the ¡¬344_patent are construed narrowly in light of the prosecution_history claim 4 of the ¡¬296_patent_should not be subject to the same narrow construction because it lacks two critical limitations found in the ¡¬344 claims-the` locking' feature and the` internal seal means'
while it is true that claim 4 of the ¡¬296_patent does not specifically recite those features the` valve_means' limitation of that claim is nonetheless written in means-plus-function_format and it contains several subordinate limitations that are also written in means-plus-function_format
as such the scope of the` valve_means' limitation of claim 4 like the scope of the other means-plus-function_limitations at issue in this case is limited to the structures disclosed in the written description that correspond to the recited functions plus their equivalents
see micro chem. inc. v. great plains chem co. 194_f.3d_1250 1257-58 52_uspq2d_1258 1263 fed.cir.1999
the structure that corresponds to the recited functions as we have explained does not read directly on the sorenson_device and by virtue of palmers characterization of his valve_structure the disclosed structure-a vacuum_control_valve with a static internal seal- can not be regarded as equivalent to a dynamic pressure_valve with a shaft-to-seal_interface

c. because there is no dispute over the structure of the accused device resolution of the claim_construction issue in this case dictates the outcome of the infringement inquiry
the trial_court correctly concluded that the` valve_means' limitation can not encompass the accused device because the accused device includes structural features that the applicant represented were different from the invention
palmer gave specific detailed reasons for distinguishing his valve from the prior_art_valves and in light of those statements no reasonable jury could find that the disclosed valve is equivalent to the valve_structure in the accused devices

the valve of the sorenson_device has a biasing_means that applies force at about a 45-degree angle to the fluid_flow
because the biasing_means in the sorenson_device is not perpendicular to the fluid_flow the biasing_means can be overcome by vacuum_pressure in the catheter as in the case of the prior_art_devices
thus the accused device is a` pressure_valve' within the meaning of palmers affidavit
that is the accused device suffers from the very shortcoming described by palmer in the disputed amendment the vacuum side i.e. the direction of fluid_flow is opposite to the biasing_means which can potentially cause the valve to` open or leak' as palmer warned

the sealing structure of the accused device also can not be considered equivalent to the disclosed structure
the accused valve has a plunger shaft with seals on its upper and lower portions
the seals slide with the plunger along the shaft walls as the plunger is actuated
the sorenson seals thus display exactly the type of dynamic_seal-to-shaft_interface that palmer said his device did not have
palmer argues that the sorenson_device unlike the prior_art_devices has an upper o-ring_seal that helps prevent cross-contamination into and out of the interior of the catheter in the accused device
as we have noted however palmer did not disclose or claim all structures that impede contamination nor is ballard entitled to have the means- *1363 plus-function_claims of the two patents construed to cover all structures that perform that function
the fact that sorenson used an additional structure to attempt to maintain sterile conditions within the catheter does not make the sorenson structure equivalent to the structure set forth in the specification of the ballard patent

d. having concluded that the sorenson_device is not equivalent to the structure disclosed in the ¡¬344 and ¡¬296_patent_s for purposes of section 112_paragraph_6 we also hold that the sorenson_device does not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents
the same distinctions of the prior_art that inform the claim_construction in this case give rise to prosecution_history_estoppel and prevent the doctrine of equivalents from capturing structure that the patentee surrendered during prosecution
moreover where the claim of infringement under section 112_paragraph_6 fails on the ground that the accused device is not equivalent to the structure disclosed in the specification the doctrine of equivalents is available only if unlike in this case the accused device represents new technology developed after the issuance of the patent

e. we note that claim 26 of the ¡¬344_patent unlike the other_asserted_claims is a method claim and is not in means-plus-function form
ballard notes that claim 26 was asserted below but all of the arguments in ballards brief focus on the construction of the means-plus-function limitation of the other_asserted_claims
since ballard has presented no argument to us directed particularly to claim 26 the question of the proper construction of that claim has been waived

``

we also decline to address ballards contention that the seal of the 344_and_296 patents is not static but is at least partly dynamic so that the district_courts construction of the claims at issue as excluding dynamic_seals had the effect of making the patent not read on the only disclosed embodiment
ballards counsel did not raise that contention until oral argument in this case and even then only on rebuttal
that is far too late to raise an argument for reversal on appeal
ballard has characterized its seal as static throughout the proceedings in this case and we reject ballards eleventh-hour effort to alter that characterization

iii
because the patentee explicitly represented during prosecution that his claims differed from structures in the prior_art we construe the disputed claims to exclude the disclaimed structures
based on that construction we uphold the district_courts summary_judgment of noninfringement
