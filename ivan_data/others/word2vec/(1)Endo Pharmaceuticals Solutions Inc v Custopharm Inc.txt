endo_pharmaceuticals_solutions inc. endo holds the approved new drug application for aveedthe_r a testosterone undecanoate tu intramuscular_injection
bayer intellectual property gmbh and bayer_pharma_ag bayer own the two patents listed in the orange book for aveedthe_r u.s. patent nos._7718,640 the640_patent and 8,338,395 the395_patent
custopharm_inc.s custopharm predecessor-in-interest paddock laboratories llc submitted an abbreviated_new_drug_application anda to the u.s. food and drug administration fda for approval to produce and market a generic version of aveedthe_r
in connection with the anda filing custopharm made a paragraph iv certification and gave notice of the certification to endo and bayer on october 8 2014
on november 20 2014 endo and bayer brought an action alleging infringement of the640 and395_patent s. during the proceedings custopharm stipulated to infringement and endo and bayer limited their asserted claims to claim 2 of the640_patent and claim 18 of the395_patent
after a four-day bench_trial on invalidity the district_court concluded that custopharm had not proven that the claims were invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
custopharm appealed
for the reasons below we find no reversible errors in the district_courts conclusion and accordingly we affirm

background
aveedthe_r is a long-acting injectable testosterone replacement therapy for men suffering from physiologically low levels of testosterone also known as hypogonadism
before the 2003 priority_date for the invention claimed in the640 and395_patent s then-existing testosterone replacement therapies had three significant shortcomings
first the existing injectable therapies required patients to visit their doctors *1377 every two or three weeks to receive intramuscular_injections and the available topical therapies required daily application
second the available therapies required the prescribing doctor to adjust the dosage or intervals of administration for each patient which required doctors to frequently monitor their patients testosterone_levels
third the pre-2003 therapies did not provide stable testosterone_levels leading to periods of low testosterone between treatments
patients would experience elevated testosterone_levels immediately after an injection but testosterone_levels would fall to below the normal physiological range before the next injection

aveedthe_rs patented_formulation addressed some of these shortcomings 1 after the initial two injections aveedthe_r is only administered five times a year ; 2 it is a treatment that works for nearly all men suffering from hypogonadism thus obviating the need for doctors to personalize testosterone replacement therapy ; and 3 patients on aveedthe_r avoided the fluctuations in testosterone_levels associated with other injectable products on the market before 2003
claim 2 of the640_patent and claim 18 of the395_patent cover aveedthe_rs formulation and injection_regimen
both patents entitled` methods and pharmaceutical compositions for reliable achievement of acceptable serum testosterone levels' issued from the same parent application and share a common specification

claim 2 of the640_patent covers a 750 mg_dosage of tu in the composition described in claim 1 a composition formulated for intramuscular_injection in a form for single_injection according to claim 1 which contains 750 mg testosterone undecanoate
'640_patent col._13,_ll._29-31 emphasis added
claim 1 reads a composition formulated for intramuscular_injection in a form for single_injection which contains 250 mg/ml testosterone undecanoate in a vehicle containing a mixture of castor_oil and benzyl_benzoate wherein the vehicle contains castor_oil in a concentration of 40_to_42 vol %
id.at col._13,_ll._24-28 emphases added

claim 18 of the395_patent covers a 750 mg_dosage of tu in the composition and method described by claim 14 the method of claim 14 in which each dose contains 750 mg of tu
'395_patent col._16,_ll._1-2 emphasis added
claim 14 reads a method of treating a disease or symptom associated with deficient endogenous levels of testosterone in a man comprising administering by intramuscular_injection a composition comprising testosterone undecanoate tu and a vehicle consisting essentially of castor_oil and a co-solvent the castor_oil being present in the vehicle at a concentration of 42 percent or less by volume the method further comprising i an initial phase comprising 2 initial intramuscular_injections of a dose of tu at an interval of 4 weeks between injections each dose including 500 mg to 1000 mg of tu followed by ii a maintenance phase comprising subsequent intramuscular_injections of a dose of tu at an interval of 10 weeks between injections each dose including 500 mg to 1000 mg of tu
id.at col._15,_ll._17-31 emphases added
the key elements of both claims in dispute are 1 750 mg_tu 2 vehicle consisting of castor_oil and a co-solvent benzyl-benzoate in the640_patent where the castor_oil is 42 % or less by volume and 3 an injection_schedule comprising two initial_injections at an interval of four weeks followed *1378 by injections at ten week_intervals395_patent only

bayer and endo sued custopharm for infringement of the640 and395_patent s on november 20 2014
the case proceeded to a bench_trial on the sole issues of whether claim 2 of the640_patent and claim 18 of the395_patent would have been obvious to a skilled_artisan in view of the prior_art which consisted primarily of three scientific articles behre,1 nieschlag,2 and von_eckardstein3 articles
these articles describe small clinical_studies involving 1000 mg_tu_injections
the articles report using a composition of 250 mg/ml tu in castor_oil
the parties agree that the articles do not disclose or describe the use of a co-solvent
while the actual_formulation of the vehicle used in the studies was 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl_benzoate this was not reported and thus unknown to a skilled_artisan until 2007 years after the 2003 priority_date for the patents-in-suit
in 2007 saad4 disclosed that the vehicle_formulation used in the articles was 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl_benzoate also sold as nebidothe_r a 1000 mg_tu injection later marketed in europe by bayer

in addition to the articles custopharm introduced pushpalatha5 and riffkin6 as prior_art
pushpalatha is an article that describes the effects of a commercially marketed product-proluton depot proluton
proluton is an injectable composition of hydroxyprogesterone in a mixture of 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl_benzoate
it is administered once a week to pregnant_women to prevent miscarriage
riffkin is an article that describes the use of castor_oil for the parenteral administration of steroids
it discloses a castor_oil and benzyl_benzoate vehicle to improve the solvent abilities of castor_oil

after a four-day trial the district_court found that custopharm had not met its burden of proving that the disputed claims would have been obvious
specifically the district_court found that the prior_art did not disclose the 750 mg_tu injection dosage and that custopharm had not shown by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to lower the dosage of tu from 1000 mg to 750 mg due to concerns patients were being overdosed
further the district_court found that the articles do not inherently *1379 disclose benzyl_benzoate as a co-solvent or the particular_ratio of solvent to co-solvent claimed by the patents-in-suit simply because this formulation was what had been used in the studies forming the basis of the articles

1991 the district_court noted that inherency may only supply a missing claim_limitation if the limitation at issue is the` natural_result' of the combination of prior_art elements or a` necessarily present' limitation

finally the district_court found that the prior_art did not disclose the specific_injection_schedule claimed in the395_patent and was unpersuaded by custopharms argument that it would have been obvious to a skilled_artisan to arrive at this specific schedule

the640 and395_patent s disclose three primary elements in the composition and administration of aveedthe_r 1 750 mg_tu in 2 a 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl_benzoate vehicle the benzyl_benzoate element only applies to the640_patent ; the395_patent only requires a co-solvent 3 administered at an initial interval of two injections four weeks apart and maintenance_injections at ten week_intervals thereafter395_patent only
custopharm contends that the articles inherently describe the vehicle_formulation 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl_benzoate
and a skilled_artisan would have recognized that patients were being overdosed with 1000 mg_tu_injections at a concentration of 250 mg/ml for a total of 4 ml injected fluid
relying on that premise custopharm argues that it would have been obvious to a skilled_artisan to reduce the amount of injected fluid to 3 ml while maintaining the same tu concentration for a total of 750 mg_tu per injection
this dose adjustment would in turn make the injection interval adjustment including the use of a two-phase dosing regimen obvious
we disagree as we see no clear_error in the district_courts underlying factual findings
below we discuss each of the elements in further detail

a. testosterone dose
neither party contests that the prior_art does not disclose a 750 mg_dosage of tu
custopharm argues that the district_court clearly erred in finding no motivation for a skilled_artisan to lower the dose of tu from 1000 mg to 750 mg because in view of the american association of clinical endocrinologists aace guidelines patients in prior_art clinical_studies were being overdosed
the aace_guidelines set the range of normal testosterone_levels at 200_to_800 nanograms/deciliter ng/dl or 9.big_token__7_to_27__big_token7 nanomoles/liter nmol/l
under these guidelines four of the fourteen patients in the behre_study would be regarded as having testosterone_levels exceeding the normal_range based on a measurement three days after an injection of 1000 *1380 mg of tu
accordingly custopharm contends that a skilled_artisan would have recognized that these patients were being overdosed and would have been motivated to reduce the dose from 1000 mg to 750 mg by injecting patients with 3 ml instead of 4 ml of solution at a tu concentration of 250 mg/ml
the district_court reasonably rejected this argument

first custopharms overdose argument is predicated on the assumption that a skilled_artisan would have applied the aace_guidelines to the exclusion of other guidelines that existed at the time including the fda_guidelines
under the fda_guidelines the range of normal testosterone is 300_to_1000 ng/dl or 10_to_35 nmol/l
the record evidence sufficiently demonstrates that the most prevalently applied guidelines in clinical_practice were the fda_guidelines not the aace_guidelines
the studies underlying the articles all employed the fda_guidelines
the patents-in-suit also cited the fda_guidelines
'640_patent col._8,_ll._59-61 ;395_patent col._9,_ll._24-26
aveedthe_rs label similarly references the 300_to_1000 ng/dl normal_range
moreover a passage in a textbook that custopharms own expert dr. peter schlegel edited confirms that` [ t ] he most common [ guideline ] in clinical_practice is a food & drug administration range of 300_to_1000 nanograms per deciliter'
loren jones & craig niederberger medical therapy for male infertility fertility preservation in male cancer patients john p. mulhall linda d. applegarth robert d. oates peter n. schlegel eds. 2013

under the fda_guidelines only one participant in the behre_study had testosterone_levels that exceeded the normal_range when measured three days after the injection of 1000 mg of tu
four weeks after injection however this individuals testosterone level dropped below the normal_range
further behre specifically reported that a single 1000 mg injection of tu` does not result in supranormal serum testosterone_levels but in much prolonged action'
j.a
1129.7 thus the district_court reasonably rejected custopharms argument that a skilled_artisan would consider 1000 mg of tu to be an overdose and would have been motivated to lower the dosage to the patented 750 mg

second custopharm argues that the obviousness of an invention does not require using the` best' motivation8 ; only a` suitable' motivation is required
par pharm. 773 f.3d at 1197-98
but this is a misunderstanding of custopharms burden
while the fda_guidelines do not teach away from using the aace_guidelines the district_court found that custopharm had not shown by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have recognized that patients injected with 1000 mg_tu were being overdosed
to meet its burden custopharm needed to do more than merely show that the prior_art does not preclude lowering the dose of tu
custopharm needed to affirmatively demonstrate that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to lower the dose of tu despite no clear evidence of overdosing under the fda_guidelines

cir
2007` [ t ] he burden falls on the challenger of the patent to show by clear and *1381 convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art_references to achieve the claimed invention..'

third custopharms overdose_theory improperly assumes that the only solution to overdosed patients is to reduce dosage rather than extending the injection intervals
endo and bayer argue that this data would likely teach a skilled_artisan formulating a long-acting testosterone_injection not to decrease the dose-because four weeks after the initial injection of 1000 mg_tu five out of the fourteen patients had testosterone_levels below the normal_range-but to alter the injection_schedule
accordingly the district_court did not err in rejecting custopharms overdose_theory

b
vehicle formulation
regarding the vehicle_formulation custopharm makes two arguments on appeal
first custopharm argues that the district_court erred in finding that the vehicle_formulation-40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl_benzoate-was not inherently described by the articles
second custopharm argues that the district_court erred in finding no motivation to combine the vehicle_formulation of proluton with the lowered dose and modified injection_schedule
we discuss each in turn

inherency
to establish that a prior_art_reference inherently-rather than expressly-discloses a claim_limitation` the limitation at issue necessarily must be present or [ is ] the natural_result of the combination of elements explicitly disclosed by the prior_art'
par pharm. 773 f.3d at 1196
here custopharm argues that the vehicle_formulation was` necessarily present' in the articles because it was later revealed to be the actual_formulation the authors of the articles used in their reported clinical_studies
we disagree

an inherent_characteristic of a formulation can be part of the prior_art in an obviousness analysis even if the inherent_characteristic was unrecognized or unappreciated by a skilled_artisan
see in re kao 639_f.3d_1057 1070 fed
cir
2011
but inherency` may not be established by probabilities or possibilities'

... obviousness can not be predicated on what is unknown'
( quoting in re spormann 363_f.2d_444 448 ccpa 1966

custopharm argues that the vehicle_formulation was inherently disclosed because the articles provide a de-tailed recitation of the tu_injection_compositions pharmacokinetic_performance from which a skilled_artisan could derive that the vehicle consisted of 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl_benzoate
the district_court reasonably found that this was not enough` to establish that the articles barred the possibility of an alternative vehicle being used in the prior_art compositions' to meet the rigorous standard of inherency
j.a
38

first custopharm has not demonstrated that a skilled_artisan could extrapolate the vehicle_formulation used in the articles from pharmacokinetic_performance data
custopharms own opening brief *1382 does not argue that the pharmacokinetic_performance reported in the articles can only be attributed to the claimed vehicle_formulation
see appellants opening_br.at 28` differences in the formulation could produce pharmacokinetic differences'
( emphasis added
moreover custopharms brief incorrectly shifts the burden of proof to endo and bayer
custopharm argues that dr. derendorf endo and bayers pharmacokinetic expert failed to provide any evidence to support his view that` it was possible to have the same pharmacokinetic profile with two different formulations'
see id.at 29
but it is custopharms burden to present clear and convincing_evidence that the articles necessarily disclosed the vehicle_formulation to one of skill in the art
see motorola mobility llc v. int l trade comm n 737_f.3d_1345 1350 fed
cir
2013
and custopharms experts testimony and briefing fall short of meeting this burden

second the prior_art was replete with potential co-solvents such that a skilled_artisan reviewing the articles would not have necessarily recognized that the articles authors used benzyl_benzoate as a co-solvent for their reported clinical_studies
endo and bayers expert testified that based on the articles disclosures a skilled_artisan would not have recognized that a co-solvent was necessary
and even if a skilled_artisan concluded that a co-solvent was necessary there were any number of available co-solvents including for example benzyl alcohol ethanol cottonseed oil sesame oil peanut oil corn oil fractionated coconut oil ethyl lactate ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate
moreover custopharms expert conceded that even knowing the identity of the co-solvent would not necessarily lead a skilled_artisan to the particular_ratio claimed in the650 and395_patent s. j.a
404_at_9219-23` q now looking at von_eckardstein two separate questions
a person of ordinary_skill reading von_eckardstein would he know that its necessarily using a 40 percent castor_oil 60 percent benzyl_benzoate solution ?
a no`
riffkin for example discloses multiple vehicle_formulations that range from 50 %_castor_oil to 98 %_castor_oil

third the cases custopharm cited to support its inherency argument are inapposite
in in re omeprazole patent litigation the claims at issue were directed to a process for making a pharmaceutical composition which included an in situ separating layer or subcoating
483_f.3d_1364_(fed._cir._2007)
we found claim 1 to be inherently anticipated in light of a chong kun dan corporation ckd patent application that disclosed an omeprazole tablet
id.at 1373-74
while the ckd_application expressly disavowed the presence of a separating layer the record showed that the in situ separating layer was in fact a natural_result of using the ingredients outlined in the ckd_application
id.at 1373
thus though the inventors` may not have recognized that a characteristic of ckds method a ingredients disclosed in the ckd patent application resulted in an in situ_formation of a separating layer' we held that the in situ_formation was inherent because` the record shows formation of the in situ separating layer in the prior_art even though that process was not recognized at the time'
id
unlike omeprazole where we found the in situ separating layer inherent because it would result each and every time a skilled_artisan followed the prior_art process custopharm has not demonstrated discussed supra that the pharmacokinetic_performance_profile cmax-concentration maximum ; tmax-time of reaching cmax ; t1/2£]-terminal elimination half-life ; and auc-area under the concentration versus time curve reported in the articles could only be *1383 achieved using the claimed vehicle_formulation of 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl_benzoate

custopharm also analogizes the current situation to in re crish 393_f.3d_1253_(fed._cir._2004)
in crish the invention covered a purified oligonucleotide with a human involucrin gene hinv promoter
id.at 1254-55
the specific_nucleotide_sequence was recited in the claim and called` seq id no._1'
id
a prior_publication disclosed the structure of the hinv gene including the approximate size of the promoter_region but did not disclose the sequence of the promoter_region
id.at 1255
we held that the claimed invention-the specific_nucleotide_sequence-was inherently anticipated
id.at 1258

custopharm argues that as in crish where we found that` one can not establish novelty by claiming a known material by its properties' endo and bayer are trying to claim a vehicle_formulation that was disclosed earlier in a publication on the basis that the patented claims in dispute more fully characterize the vehicle_formulation described in the prior_publication
crish 393 f.3d at 1258
but as with custopharms analogy to omeprazole custopharms argument falls short because it has not shown through any evidence why the pharmacokinetic_performance_profile reported in the articles could be obtained only by using the claimed 40 %_castor_oil/60 %_benzyl_benzoate formulation
in crish the record was clear that the known hinv promoter_region necessarily contained the sequence that the inventor tried to patent whereas in this case the record is devoid of any proof that only one vehicle_formulation-the claimed vehicle_formulation-can be used to achieve the pharmacokinetic_performance reported in the articles

importantly crish and omeprazole were about inherently present properties or characteristics for a` known' prior_art product
but here the tu_injection_composition recounted in the articles can not be said to be` known' in the same way ; the articles failed to disclose that the compositions vehicle_formulation included another key ingredient benzyl_benzoate let_alone the ratio of benzyl_benzoate to castor_oil
and there was no evidence in the record that a skilled_artisan could determine the non-disclosed vehicle_formulation based on the reported pharmacokinetic_performance_profile or that the non-disclosed vehicle_formulation was necessarily a feature of the tu injection studied in the articles
under the circumstances of this case the incomplete description of the tu_injection_composition elements denied skilled_artisans from having access to that composition thereby precluding use of the inherency_doctrine to fill in disclosure about the product missing from the articles

thus the district_court did not err in finding that custopharm did not present clear and convincing_evidence showing the 40 %_castor_oil to 60 %_benzyl_benzoate as claimed was necessarily present in the articles.9

motivation to combine
regarding the vehicle_formulation missing from the articles custopharm alternatively *1384 argues that the district_court clearly erred in finding no motivation to combine the vehicle_formulation of proluton with the claimed lowered dose and modified injection_schedule
proluton was a commercially available injectable steroid drug hydroxy-progesterone that used a vehicle consisting of approximately 40 %_castor_oil and 60 %_benzyl_benzoate
it was administered on a weekly basis at a concentration of 250 mg/ml to prevent miscarriages
custopharm argues that even though proluton was administered weekly a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to use the vehicle_formulation from proluton to formulate a long-acting testosterone_injection because hydroxyl-progesterone and tu are both hormones injected at a high concentration of 250 mg/ml
moreover even before the vehicle in proluton was disclosed the combination of castor_oil and benzyl_benzoate was taught in riffkin.10 custopharms proluton-based argument lacks merit

the district_court correctly noted that it is custopharms` burden to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the articles and other cited prior_art with the vehicle used in proluton'
j.a
36
the district_court found that custopharm failed to meet its burden because while proluton and riffkin do suggest the use of a co-solvent they do not suggest that the co-solvent necessarily be benzyl_benzoate as opposed to the other co-solvents known in the art see discussion supra regarding the large number of possible co-solvents
further while proluton was commercially available before 2003 it is not a testosterone product for men ; rather it is administered to pregnant_women to prevent miscarriage
and importantly it is not an injectable steroid with prolonged activity
the district_court was not persuaded that a skilled_artisan would have turned to the vehicle in proluton when formulating a long-acting injectable testosterone_therapy

given that proluton is a weekly injection and is not directed to prolonged activity we agree
we conclude that the district_court did not err in rejecting custopharms argument that the patented_formulation for aveedthe_r was obvious over proluton in view of the prior_art

c. injection schedule
custopharm also argues on appeal that once a skilled_artisan recognized that patients injected with 1000 mg_tu were being overdosed the specific_injection_schedule claimed in claim 18 of the395_patent would be the result of routine treatment of individual_patients and thus obvious
custopharm first argues that there is no basis for limiting the injection_schedule to administration of` a population dose' because claim 18 would be infringed by the administration to a single patient
and viewing the injection_schedule from the perspective of individual_patients it would have been obvious for a skilled_artisan such as a clinician to adjust the injection interval for at least one patient to that disclosed in claim 18-two initial_injections four weeks apart followed by maintenance_injections every ten weeks

custopharm points out that both nieschlag and von_eckardstein disclosed tu_injections resulting in drug_accumulation i.e
increasingly high testosterone_levels over time
such drug_accumulation makes it possible to extend the dosing interval
this custopharm reasons suggests to a *1385 skilled_artisan a two-phase dosing regimen
nieschlag teaches four doses at six week_intervals and that the intervals may be extended to up to ten weeks or more due to drug_accumulation
von_eckardstein discloses that the interval between doses could be increased up to twelve weeks
custopharm argues that together these articles suggest a first phase of dosing with a shorter interval between injections nieschlag and a steady state phase consisting of a longer interval for maintenance von_eckardstein
further because a skilled_artisan would have recognized that each dose would need to be reduced from 1000 mg to 750 mg to reduce the risk of overdosing it follows that he would shorten the six-week_interval in nieschlag and the twelve-week_interval in von_eckardstein to prevent tu levels from going below the normal_range
the district_court did not err in finding this argument unpersuasive

first this argument is predicated on custopharms overdose_theory which we have already rejected supra

second read together the articles do not clearly con-template a two-phase dosing regimen with initial loading_doses followed by maintenance doses
the articles them-selves do not explicitly teach the use of loading_doses
while it is possible to interpret von_eckardstein as using loading_doses the district_court reasonably characterized von_eckardstein as a follow-up study to nieschlag seeking to investigate prolonged injection intervals
j.a
25` von_eckardstein described a clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of prolonged tu_treatment at extended_injection_intervals over a 3.2 year_period
seven patients who had participated in the study described in nieschlag received four injections at six week_intervals followed by a gradual_increase in the interval between the fifth and tenth_injections
after the tenth_injection the interval was increased to twelve weeks`
thus the articles reasonably teach a skilled_artisan to increase the intervals between doses not to initially shorten them to four weeks and then to lengthen them to ten weeks

third custopharms explanation for why a skilled_artisan would have a reasonable expectation of success that changing the injection_regimen would result in a long-acting testosterone_therapy is lacking
endo presented evidence that oil based depot slow release injections such as tu_injections can behave in unpredictable ways and that such dose and regimen changes would require more than routine experimentation
namely this is because it was unclear from the articles if there is a linear relationship between the dose amount and the amount of tu in the patients body
custopharm does not directly dispute this pharmacokinetic argument ; rather it contends on appeal that the district_court did not give the proper weight to its argument that the invention should be viewed from the perspective of the individual patient
the invention however is meant to achieve a commercially viable testosterone_therapy
'640_patent col._2,_ll._49-54` there is a need of providing reliable standard regimens acceptable for a broad population of men in need thereof preferably regimens without the need of occasional control of serum testosterone_levels and regimens wherein steady state conditions are achieved within a shorter time period

part of the obviousness_inquiry involves *1386 examining what a skilled_artisan would be motivated to do given` the effects of demands known to the design community or present in the marketplace'
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 418 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
the district_court thus did not err in considering the obviousness_inquiry from the perspective of a skilled_artisan` confronted with the same problems as the inventor' which in this case is developing a commercially viable long-acting testosterone_therapy

doing so the district_court properly found that custopharm failed to meet its burden of showing that a skilled_artisan would combine the lowered dose with the injection_schedule in the manner claimed

conclusion
the district_court did not commit reversible error in finding that claim 2 of the640_patent and claim 18 of the395_patent were not proven to be obvious over the prior_art
we have considered custopharms other arguments and find them unpersuasive
therefore we affirm the district_courts decision

affirmed

moreover custopharms argument that four of the fourteen patients in behres study were being overdosed under the aace_guidelines is based on undisclosed data underlying the behre_study which the district_court correctly refused to consider because it is not prior_art

presumably determining whether patients were being overdosed under the fda_guidelines would constitute using the` best' motivation though custopharm does contest whether the fda_guidelines were the` best' to apply

custopharm also made a public policy argument in its opening brief applying the policy rationale underlying the public use bar under pre-aia ¡± 102 b to the inherency analysis

custopharm however did not respond to endos contention that custopharm waived this argument by failing to raise it before the district_court
we agree with endo
in its reply brief custopharm argued that helsinn healthcare s.a. v. teva pharmaceuticals usa inc. is a pertinent intervening case but did not explain how it is an intervening change in law to the inherency_doctrine especially given that it is an on-sale bar case
