background
fournier is the assignee of the ¡¬726_patent
the ¡¬726_patent includes claims directed to a therapeutic fenofibrate_composition claims 1-7 a method for the manufacture of that fenofibrate_composition claims 8_and_9 a method for improving the bioavailability of fenofibrate claim 10 and a method for treatment of hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia using the claimed fenofibrate_composition claims 11_and_12

abbott is fourniers exclusive licensee under the ¡¬726_patent
abbott also holds a new drug application` nda' approved *1326 by the united states food and drug administration` fda' permitting it to market fourniers fenofibrate_capsules in the united states
abbott sells the capsules under the tradename tricor the_r

novopharm filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' in december 1999 seeking the fdas approval to market a generic micronized formulation of fenofibrate prior to the expiration of the ¡¬726_patent
along with its anda novopharm submitted a certification under 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv a` paragraph_iv_certification' declaring that the manufacture use and sale of its proposed fenofibrate formulation would not infringe the ¡¬726_patent
under 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 b i an anda applicant who files a paragraph_iv_certification is required to include in its application a statement that it will give notice of that filing to the owner of the patent to which the certification pertains ¡± 355 j 2 b i i and to the holder of the approved nda for that drug ¡± 355 j 2 b i ii
pursuant to those provisions novopharm notified fournier and abbott respectively that it had filed the anda and paragraph_iv_certification
also as required by 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 b ii novopharm provided in its notice letter a detailed statement of the factual and legal bases for its opinion of noninfringement of the ¡¬726_patent

fournier and abbott then filed suit against novopharm
they alleged that novopharms generic_version of tricorthe_r would infringe one or more claims of the ¡¬726_patent and that novopharms submission of an anda for approval to sell fenofibrate_capsules prior to the expiration of the ¡¬726_patent constituted an act of infringement under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2
that provision in pertinent part provides that it shall be an act of infringement to submit- a an application under section 505 j of the federal food drug and cosmetic act [ codified at 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j ; i.e. an anda ].. for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent.. if the purpose of such submission is to obtain approval under such act [ i.e. title 21 of the united states code ] to engage in the commercial manufacture use or sale of a drug.. claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent
35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 2000
fournier and abbott sought among other things a judgment that the ¡¬726_patent was valid enforceable and infringed ; an order staying the approval of novopharms anda until the january 19 2009 expiration date of the ¡¬726_patent ; and an injunction prohibiting novopharm from commercially manufacturing selling using or importing infringing fenofibrate_compositions

novopharm amended its anda twice both times adding a new dosage form and including a paragraph_iv_certification for the newly added form
following each of those amendments fournier and abbott filed a new complaint against novopharm
the district_court eventually consolidated all three actions into a single proceeding.1 novopharm thereafter moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement

*big_token__1327_claims_1__big_token and 10 which are the ¡¬726_patents only two independent_claims define the patented subject matter as follows 1
a therapeutic composition which is presented in the form of gelatin_capsules and which is useful especially in the oral treatment of hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia said composition containing a co-micronized mixture of particles of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant wherein the mean_particle_size of said co-micronized mixture is less than 15 £g
10
a method for improving the bioavailability of fenofibrate in vivo which comprises co-micronization of the fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant the said co-micronization being carried out by micronization of a fenofibrate/solid_surfactant_mixture until the particle_size of the powder obtained is less than 15 £g
( emphases added

claim 1 of the ¡¬726_patent was amended during prosecution in response to a rejection under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
as originally filed that claim recited the phrase` the said composition containing fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant which have been co-micronized'
the amendment made during prosecution replaced that phrase with` said composition containing a co-micronized mixture of particles of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant wherein the mean_particle_size of the co-micronized mixture is less than 15 £g'
the ¡¬726_patent_specification includes data showing that the patented composition has improved properties relative to formulations in which 1 a solid_surfactant is added to fenofibrate impliedly without co-micronization ; 2 fenofibrate is micronized on its own ; or 3 fenofibrate and surfactant are separately micronized and then intimately mixed
¡¬726_patent col._1,_ll._35-43
during prosecution of the application that led to the ¡¬726_patent fournier also distinguished its composition from prior_art formulations in which fenofibrate was granulated in a matrix containing a particle_size of between 50_and_500 microns

the district_court found that fournier had distinguished the claimed invention as amended from the cited prior_art on the ground that the prior_art did not teach or suggest co-micronization of a mixture of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant which co-micronization resulted in an improvement in bioavailability and dissolution rate not taught or suggested in the prior_art
abbott slip op.at 2-3
fournier further distinguished the amended claim on the basis that co-micronization to produce particles having a diameter of less than fifteen microns was not taught or suggested in the prior_art
id
the court also observed that the ¡¬726_patents specification states that the` co-micronization of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant i.e. the micronization of an intimate_mixture of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant makes it possible to improve the bioavailability of the fenofibrate to a significantly greater extent than that which would be achieved either by adding a surfactant [ to fenofibrate ] or by micronizing the fenofibrate on its own or by intimately mixing the separately micronized_fenofibrate and surfactant'
id.at 4 alteration in original
the court thus concluded that fourniers claims could not be construed to include` mixtures obtained by adding a surfactant to fenofibrate or micronizing fenofibrate by itself and/or mixing separately micronized_fenofibrate and surfactant'
id.at 11

the district_court then found that sodium lauryl sulfate` sls' was the only example of a solid_surfactant and that a method involving co-micronization of a fenofibrate/sls mixture prior to the addition of excipients such as lactose or starch *1328 was the only detailed example of co-micronization disclosed in the ¡¬726_patent
id.at 4-5
elaborating on that point the court found further that` [ t ] he claims description and prosecution_history do not indicate that anything other than fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant are micronized.. no other excipient is identified as part of this mixture'
id.at 12
the court concluded on the basis of those findings that the term` co-microniz [ -ed -ation ]' in independent_claims 1_and_10 does not encompass co-micronization of excipients other than fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant but instead` is construed to mean that fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant have been micronized together in the absence of other_excipients'
id
the court also concluded that the phrase` fenofibrate/solid_surfactant_mixture' in claim 10 of the ¡¬726_patent must be construed according to novopharms proposal so as to exclude any ingredients other than fenofibrate and solid_surfactant noting that fournier and abbott had not objected to that construction
id
the court applied essentially the same construction to the phrase` mixture of particles of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant' in claim 1 interpreting that phrase to mean a` mixture wholly of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant to the exclusion of any other_excipients'
id.at 13

having so construed the claims the district_court then considered novopharms proposed fenofibrate formulations
the court found that according to the anda novopharms process for making its proposed products involves pre-micronizing fenofibrate on its own i.e. in the absence of solid_surfactant
the pre-micronized_fenofibrate is then dry mixed with lactose monohydrate pregelatinized starch croscarmellose sodium and crosspovidone
separately a` granulating_solution' is prepared by dissolving povidone and sls in water
the granulating_solution is then added to the dry fenofibrate/excipient mixture and the resulting mixture is then subjected to a` wet_granulation' process which involves mixing with the introduction of additional water to form a uniform wet mass
the wet mass is then dried to form a dried granulated mixture of fenofibrate sls and excipients
the granulated mixture is dry blended with additional croscarmellose sodium crosspovidone and magnesium stearate to produce granules that can pass through a # 16 mesh screen for storage and eventual encapsulation into gelatin_capsules
id.at 6

in novopharms motion for summary_judgment it had argued that its process does not include co-micronization of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant and therefore would not infringe the ¡¬726_patent
fournier and abbott opposed novopharms motion alleging that the wet_granulation and drying steps used by novopharm constitute the required co-micronization because the fenofibrate particles are reduced in size during those steps
nonetheless finding that there was no dispute among the parties that fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant are not` micronized together in the absence of other_excipients' in novopharms process and having already construed the claims to require just that the court held that novopharms formulations could not literally infringe either independent claim in the patent
id.at 14

the court also ruled out infringement under the doctrine of equivalents on the basis of prosecution_history estoppel
the court reasoned that fourniers prosecution arguments which distinguished the claimed invention from the prior_art on the ground that the prior_art did not teach or suggest co-micronization of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant such that the co-micronization resulted in improved bioavailability viewed together with statements in the patent specification and arguments that *1329 fournier made during reexamination of the ¡¬726_patent would reasonably lead a competitor to conclude that fournier had` relinquished a product and process that involved either adding a surfactant by itself or by micronizing the fenofibrate on its own or by intimately mixing the separately micronized_fenofibrate and surfactant'
id.at 14-16
having concluded that fournier and abbott had relinquished coverage of novopharms process and thus could not prevail the district_court granted novopharms motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement

fournier and abbott now appeal

fournier and abbott argue on appeal that the district_court erred by construing the claim_term` co-micronization' to require micronization of fenofibrate and solid_surfactant` in the absence of other_excipients'
they argue that the court also erred by construing the claim phrase` mixture of' to mean` mixture wholly of' again requiring exclusion of all ingredients other than fenofibrate and solid_surfactant in the mixture during co-micronization
according to the appellants both misconstructions *1330 result from the courts having improperly imported limitations into the claims from the patents non-limiting examples

we disagree first with the appellants contention that the district_court misconstrued the term` co-micronization'
although courts` must presume that the terms in a claim mean what they say and unless otherwise compelled give full effect to the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of claim_terms' johnson worldwide assocs. inc. v. zebco corp. 175_f.3d_985 989 50_uspq2d_1607 1610 fed.cir.1999 ; see also nike inc. v. wolverine world wide inc. 43_f.3d_644 646 33_uspq2d_1038 1039 fed.cir.1994 ; e.i
du pont de nemours & co. v. phillips petroleum 849_f.2d_1430 1433 7_uspq2d_1129 1131 fed.cir.1988 we have previously identified limited situations` where a sufficient reason exists to require the entry of a definition of a claim_term other than its ordinary and accustomed_meaning' johnson worldwide 175 f.3d at 990 50 uspq2d at 1610
one such situation is when the patentee` has chosen to be his or her own_lexicographer by clearly setting forth an explicit definition for a claim_term'
id

the district_court found that although the term` co-micronization' was not known in the art prior to the filing date of the application that led to the ¡¬ 726 patent both` micronization' and the prefix` co-' had well-known meanings as of that date and one of ordinary skill in the art at that time therefore would have readily understood the meaning of` co-micronization'
had that term not been explicitly defined in the ¡¬726_patent_specification we might well agree with the appellants that that term could simply mean` micronized with or together' and would not necessarily exclude the presence of ingredients not specifically recited in the claim
however the phrase` co-micronization of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant' is in fact explicitly defined at column 1 lines 35-38 of the ¡¬726_patent as` micronization of an intimate_mixture of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant'
hence this is a case in which the patentee has` chosen to be his own_lexicographer' and the district_court did not err by reading the patentees definition from the specification into the claim
moreover the inclusion of the word` intimate' in the definition together with the fact that fenofibrate and sls are the only ingredients present in every co-micronized mixture described in the ¡¬726_patents specification makes it abundantly clear that` co-micronization of.. fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant' should be construed as referring to co-micronization of a mixture consisting essentially of fenofibrate and solid_surfactant.2

since each of the claims of the ¡¬726_patent requires either` a co-micronized mixture of particles of fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant' or` co-micronization of the fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant.. carried out by micronization of a fenofibrate/solid_surfactant_mixture' each of the claims requires co-micronization of a mixture consisting essentially of only fenofibrate and solid_surfactant
because it is undisputed that fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant are not mixed in novopharms process without other significant ingredients viz. excipients and water being present we conclude that there is no genuine_issue of material_fact as to literal infringement in this case

fournier and abbott also argue however that the district_court erred in its analysis of infringement under the doctrine of *1331 equivalents by holding that fournier had relinquished during prosecution coverage of all methods in which fenofibrate is pre-micronized
fournier and abbott further contend that the court erred by concluding that no genuine_issue of material_fact exists with respect to infringement by equivalents and thus that the courts grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement was improper

in addition to assigning error to the district_courts claim_construction the appellants argue that there is substantial unrebutted record evidence that novopharms fenofibrate product undergoes a decrease in particle_size to less than fifteen microns during novopharms wet_granulation and drying steps
fenofibrate and sls are simultaneously present in those steps and the appellants assert the reduction in fenofibrate_particle_size in the presence of sls therefore constitutes` co-micronization'

we agree with the appellants that the court erred in its doctrine of equivalents analysis to the extent that it suggested that fournier had relinquished coverage of all formulations made by methods in which fenofibrate is pre-micronized
although fournier distinguished its claimed composition from formulations prepared by combining pre-micronized_fenofibrate with a pre-micronized or non-micronized solid_surfactant without subsequent co-micronization and is accordingly estopped from asserting coverage of such formulations under the doctrine of equivalents nothing in the ¡¬726_patents specification prosecution_history or reexamination record indicates that fournier gave up coverage of compositions prepared by processes in which pre-micronized_fenofibrate is later further micronized in the presence of a solid_surfactant that is co-micronized with the solid_surfactant
however that error was harmless here

the process described in novopharms anda does not include any step in which fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant are in a mixture in the absence of other_excipients and in view of the above claim_construction there can be no dispute that fenofibrate and solid_surfactant are not` co-micronized' as that term is used in the ¡¬726_patent
significantly novopharms process does not involve micronization of any mixture that includes fenofibrate and a solid_surfactant irrespective of the presence or absence of other_excipients as the sls is dissolved in the aqueous granulating_solution prior to mixing with the fenofibrate and remains in solution throughout the wet_granulation and drying steps
dissolved sls is clearly not a` solid_surfactant'
thus even assuming that novopharms wet_granulation and drying steps result in some reduction in fenofibrate_particle_size those steps nonetheless can not as a matter of law constitute co-micronization of an intimate_mixture of fenofibrate and solid_surfactant
to hold otherwise would vitiate that limitation altogether in contravention of the all-elements rule
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 39 n. 8 117_s.ct._1040

we have considered abbott and fourniers other arguments and find them unpersuasive

conclusion
the district_court did not err in granting summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of novopharm for no genuine_issue of material_fact exists in this case
the courts decision is therefore affirmed
