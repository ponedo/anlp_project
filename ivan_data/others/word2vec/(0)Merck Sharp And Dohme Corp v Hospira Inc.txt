because the district_court did not err in its conclusion of obviousness we affirm

background
merck owns the150_patent which is directed to a process for preparing a stable_formulation of ertapenem an antibiotic_compound shown below ?
ertapenem is known to be unstable because of two degradation reactions-hydrolysis of the lactam nitrogen highlighted by a red circle and dimerization via the pyrrolidine_nitrogen highlighted by a blue square

the prior_art taught that ertapenem can be stabilized from dimerization by reacting the pyrrolidine_nitrogen with carbon dioxide to form a` carbon_dioxide_adduct'
the method of the150_patent claims a manufacturing process for a final_formulation of the antibiotic that purportedly minimizes both dimerization and hydrolysis degradation pathways
see appellants br
12-14
claim 21 is representative and reads as follows 21
a process for preparing a final_formulation_product of a compound of formula ia *727

?
or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrates wherein r4 r5 and r6 are independently a hydrogen
( b c1-c6 -alkyl or

'150_patent col. 18_ll._11 -43

on may_29,_2014 hospira inc.` hospira' notified merck that it had filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture use or sale of generic versions of mercks invanzthe_r_product the principal component of which is the carbon_dioxide_adduct of ertapenem
in response merck sued hospira for infringement of two patents-the150_patent and u.s._patent 5,952,323` the323_patent`
the district_court concluded that the asserted claims of the323_patent were not invalid and were infringed and that the asserted claims of the150_patent would also be infringed but were invalid as obvious over the323_patent and pct publication wo 98/18800` almarsson'
see decision 2016_wl_5872620 at *11 *16 *21

the district_court found that while none of the three steps of claim 21 of the150_patent was individually taught by the prior_art the` recipe' for the final_formulation was disclosed and the three steps leading to that formulation were nothing more than conventional_manufacturing_steps that would have been obvious from the disclosures and thus were the product of routine_experimentation
id.at *17-20
the court found that both references expressly taught that the formation of the carbon_dioxide_adduct is ph-dependent and requires a ph_range of about 6.0 to about 9.0 ; sodium_hydroxide could be used to adjust the ph ; and the carbon_dioxide_adduct could be produced using` standard_lyophilization_techniques'
id.at *16-17
the court also found that while the claimed temperature_range was not explicitly taught in the prior_art it was understood that degradation is minimized at low_temperatures so one of ordinary_skill would have wanted to keep the temperature as low as possible without freezing
id.at *18

*728 regarding the dependent_claims the district_court noted that merck` focused entirely on the validity of claim 21' and thus provided no evidence rebutting hospiras experts testimony that each of the dependent_claims narrower limitations was either expressly disclosed by the references or would have been obvious from routine_experimentation
id.at *21

the district_court reviewed mercks objective_evidence and concluded that commercial_success and copying by others were shown but that the objective_evidence could not overcome the` strong_prima_facie_case of obviousness' established by hospira
id
the court found that while there was commercial_success tied to the asserted claims the evidence was` weak [ ened ]' by the` blocking effect' of u.s._patent 5,478,820` the820_patent` -directed to ertapenem itself-of which merck was the exclusive_licensee
the court explained that no other entity aside from zeneca the original patentee and merck would have had any incentive to develop a formulation of ertapenem for fear of infringing the820_patent
id.at *9

the district_court also found copying by others because hospira tried five alternative_formulations in an attempt to avoid copying the150_patent but ultimately it had to rely on the accused process which the court found would infringe the150_patent
id.at *10
however while the court found that hospiras` decision to copy [ mercks ] formulation and processis an indicium of nonobviousness` it concluded that the evidence could not overcome the strong_showing of obviousness presented by hospira based on the prior_art

i
on appeal merck argues that the district_court erred in finding that the claims would have been obvious over either the323_patent or almarsson because it is undisputed that none of the claimed steps is disclosed in the prior_art
merck contends that the court erred in relying solely on the` knowledge creativity and common_sense' of a skilled_artisan because` common_sense' is properly invoked to provide a motivation to combine not to supply a missing claim limitation
furthermore merck continues the prior_art focused solely on degradation by dimerization not hydrolysis
in that way merck argues the *729 prior_art taught away from the claimed invention because ph values favorable for reducing dimerization result in increased hydrolysis and vice versa
merck also argues that the narrow ranges recited in the dependent_claims are the result of the inventors extensive research efforts belying the courts finding that routine_experimentation would have led to their discovery

hospira responds that the district_court properly evaluated the claims as a whole and determined that they recite nothing more than an obvious implementation of the disclosures of the323_patent and almarsson
hospira contends that claim 21 recites three broad general processing steps that constitute nothing more than the routine way a skilled_artisan would have implemented the teachings of the323_patent

first hospira argues the ph_range recited in claim 21 was expressly disclosed in both prior_art references as the preferred_ph_range for forming the carbon_dioxide_adduct of ertapenem
thus hospira maintains a skilled chemist would want to first adjust a solution to the preferred ph thereby minimizing the amount of time ertapenem spends in solution at unstable ph levels
second hospira argues one of ordinary_skill would have understood that the ertapenem salt is slightly acidic as was disclosed in the prior_art and so would have simultaneously added base and ertapenem to the carbon_dioxide_solution in order to maintain the preferred_ph_range disclosed in the prior_art
furthermore hospira continues it was widely known that lower temperatures tend to slow degradation so one of ordinary_skill would have sought to achieve the lowest temperature possible without freezing
finally hospira maintains that the prior_art taught that the carbon_dioxide_adduct could be obtained by` standard_lyophilization_techniques' and claim 21 does not require any specific lyophilization conditions

we agree with hospira that the district_court did not err in finding that the claimed process would have been obvious at the time the invention was made
the court found that both references expressly taught minimizing dimerization by forming the carbon_dioxide_adduct of ertapenem at ph 6.0-9.0 that sodium_hydroxide could be used to adjust the ph and that the final adduct was to be obtained using` standard_lyophilization_techniques'
see decision 2016_wl_5872620 at *16-17
the court also found that while the claimed temperature_range was not explicitly taught in the prior_art it was understood that degradation is minimized at low_temperatures so one of ordinary_skill would have wanted to keep the temperature as low as possible without freezing
id.at *18
those findings are supported by substantial record evidence

merck argues that the specific order and detail of the claimed steps constitute a novel solution to minimizing degradation by hydrolysis-a problem not addressed by the prior_art-while operating in the ph_range of 6.0-9.0 as disclosed in the prior_art for minimizing dimerization
while that may be so mercks problem is that the purported` solution' for minimizing both degradation pathways constitutes nothing more than conventional_manufacturing_steps that implement principles disclosed in the prior_art

merck does not dispute that the323_patent and almarsson taught exposing ertapenem to a carbon_dioxide_solution while maintaining a ph_range of 6.0-9.0 followed by lyophilization
merck also does not dispute that hydrolysis was a known degradation pathway that one of ordinary_skill would have sought to minimize
see oral arg.at 3:45-3:55 http //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl=2017-1115.mp3 *730 mercks counsel stating that` open ring degradation was something that was known in the prior_art to affect all beta-lactams'

mercks purported solution for minimizing both hydrolysis and dimerization was to create the carbon_dioxide_solution first at the ph_range disclosed in the prior_art ; then simultaneously add the ertapenem and a base to the solution in order to maintain the ph_range taught by the prior_art ; maintain a low temperature during the process ; and lyophilize the final product to contain less than 10 % moisture content
the only elements of that process that were not expressly disclosed in the prior_art are emphasized in italics above-namely the order of the steps the simultaneous addition of base the specific temperature_range and a final moisture content of less than 10 %
but as the court found those are all experimental details that one of ordinary_skill would have utilized via routine_experimentation armed with the principles disclosed in the prior_art

thus it was reasonable for the district_court to deduce from the evidence that the order and detail of the steps if not already known would have been discovered by routine_experimentation while implementing known principles
the courts analysis thus involved no legal error

ii
we next address the district_courts treatment of mercks objective_evidence
merck maintains that the court improperly discounted mercks objective_evidence which it found to be persuasive when weighing the obviousness factors

hospira responds that the district_court correctly found that mercks evidence of secondary_considerations could not overcome hospiras strong_showing of obviousness based on the teachings of the prior_art
according to hospira that finding warrants deference on appeal and merck has pointed to no clear_error in the district_courts findings

considering all the evidence we conclude that the court did not err in finding the invention to have been obvious at the time the invention was made

the district_court found that there was commercial_success of mercks invanzthe_r_product and that it was sufficiently linked to the asserted claims of the150_patent
decision 2016_wl_5872620 at *8-9 *21
however the court found that this evidence was` weak [ ened ]' by the` blocking effect' of the820_patent which is directed to ertapenem itself the point being that commercial_success was not due to the qualities of ertapenem but rather to the fact that merck had control of another patent that precluded competition from others
id.at *9

mercks evidence of commercial_success should not have been discounted simply because of the existence of another patent of which merck was the exclusive_licensee
we have previously held that where` market entry was precluded' by another patent and by exclusive statutory rights stemming from fda marketing approvals` the inference of nonobviousness.. from evidence of commercial_success [ ] is weak'

usa inc. 395_f.3d_1364 1377 fed

but developers of new compounds often obtain a package of patents protecting the product including compound formulation use and process patents
often such patents result from patent office restriction requirements relating to the technicalities of patent classifications and rulings that various aspects of claiming an invention can not be claimed in the same patent
or they may result from continuing improvements in a product or process
*731 thus multiple patents do not necessarily detract from evidence of commercial_success of a product or process which speaks to the merits of the invention not to how many patents are owned by a patentee
commercial success is thus a fact-specific inquiry that may be relevant to an inference of nonobviousness even given the existence of other relevant patents

nonetheless we do not discern clear_error in the district_courts determination that mercks evidence of commercial_success could not overcome the weight of the evidence that the claimed process was substantially described in the prior_art and required only improvement by the use of established variations

thus even giving the evidence of commercial_success its full and proper weight the court did not err in concluding that the claims would have been obvious at the time the invention was made in light of the merely ordinary experimentation required to arrive at the150_patent starting from either the323_patent or almarsson for the reasons discussed above

second the district_court found that there was evidence of copying by others because hospira tried five alternative_formulations in an attempt to avoid copying the150_patent but ultimately had to rely on the accused process which the court found would infringe the150_patent
decision 2016_wl_5872620 at *10
hospira argues that` evidence of copying is not compelling in the context of anda cases because the [ hatch-waxman act ] requires generic drug manufacturers to copy the approved drug'
appellee br
55-56

we do not agree with hospiras argument nor did the district_court
the act does not as the court noted require the generic manufacturer to copy the nda holders process of manufacturing the drug
in any event as with the evidence of commercial_success the district_court found that the evidence of copying could not overcome the weight of the competing evidence of obviousness of the claimed process
we agree with the district_court
the claimed process differs from the disclosure of the323_patent only in routine details the implementation of which would have been well within the capabilities of one of ordinary_skill in the art
thus we conclude that the district_court did not err in its conclusion of obviousness

conclusion
we have considered the parties remaining arguments but find them to be unpersuasive
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the decision of the district_court

affirmed

newman circuit_judge dissenting
it is time to remedy our inconsistent treatment of the procedures and burdens in applying the evidentiary factors of obviousness despite the clarifying precedent in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
the court in graham resolved prior inconsistencies and established what was seen as a wiser standard of obviousness
the court established the factual_premises and fixed the placement of the burdens
it is time to restore this salutary rigor

in graham the court discussed the four factual_premises of obviousness1 and explored the interaction among these factors explaining that each may affect the weight of the others
the court also clarified *732 its own precedent which had separated the objective_considerations from the other factual criteria

however some federal_circuit decisions appear to have sought a shortcut and converted three of the four graham_factors into a self-standing` prima_facie' case whereby the objective_considerations must achieve rebuttal_weight
this path of analysis was followed by the district_court herein finding that hospira` made a prima_facie showing' based solely on the prior_art

thus the district_court weighed that evidence against the conclusion that the order and detail of the steps would have been discovered by routine_experimentation and placed the obligation of achieving rebuttal_weight on the fourth graham factor

however as the court established it is incorrect to consign the objective_evidence to rebuttal against the other three graham_factors
merck is correct that the question is not whether the evidence of *733 copying and commercial_success` could not overcome the weight of the competing evidence of obviousness of the claimed process'
maj. op.at 731
the question is whether the entirety of the evidence relating to the merck process including the evidence of copying and commercial_success establish obviousness
the analysis whereby less than the full factual record is consulted for the` prima_facie_case' with one of the four graham_factors shifted to rebuttal distorts the placement and the burden of proof

merck correctly points out that` the district_court either accorded insufficient weight or failed to acknowledge' the objective_indicia of nonobviousness
merck reply br.at 17
the objective_indicia of nonobviousness play a critical role in the obviousness analysis
they are` not just a cumulative or confirmatory part of the obviousness calculus but constitutes independent evidence of nonobviousness'
