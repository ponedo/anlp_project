opinion
mayer chief_judge
the mead corporation` mead' appeals from the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of georgia holding that mead infringed claims 1_and_13 of u.s. patent no._5241,806` the806_patent` owned by riverwood_international corporation` riverwood' and that these claims were not invalid for obviousness
see riverwood_int l_corp. v. mead_corp. no._194-cv-0090-cam n.d.ga
jan._13,_1999` order'
because the district_court erroneously concluded as a matter of law that the *1366 claims were not invalid for obviousness we reverse

background
this appeal arises out of a patent infringement dispute over cartoners
cartoners are machines designed to automatically group_articles such as beverage cans or bottles and load them into paperboard_cartons
cartoners are usually used in industrial applications such as beverage bottling facilities
riverwood owns the rights to the806_patent embodied in practice by its twinstack model
claim 1 and dependent claim 13 of the806_patent are the only claims at issue
these two claims cover a cartoner with three incoming streams of articles and a barrel_cam_loader
this type of cartoner is known in the art as a three-conveyer_cartoner
the loader which is usually a barrel_cam or an angulated guide in the prior_art forces the articles into the cartons
a barrel_cam pushes the articles in a manner similar to a horizontal escalator whereas an angulated guide works passively merely providing a static wall or rail to divert the path of the otherwise propelled articles

after mead developed and marketed its duostack model a three-conveyer_cartoner with a barrel_cam_loader riverwood brought suit for infringement of the806_patent
the district_court appointed a special_master pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure 53 to hear evidence and arguments from the parties
the special_master made findings of fact and concluded inter alia that claims 1_and_13 of the806_patent were invalid for obviousness
see riverwood_int l_corp. v. mead_corp. no._194-cv-0090-cam n.d.ga
mar._11,_1998` report'
the district_court accepted the findings of fact in whole and without modification but contrary to the special_master concluded that the claims would not have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art
see order at 3
mead appeals this aspect of the district_courts judgment

discussion
on appeal from a non-jury trial the ultimate determination of whether the claims at issue would have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a legal conclusion that we review de novo
see robotic vision sys. inc. v. view eng g inc. 189_f.3d_1370 1376 51_uspq2d_1948 1953 fed.cir.1999
an obviousness determination is based on underlying factual inquiries including 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claims ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 objective_evidence of nonobviousness
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 13-14 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_uspq_459 465 1966 ; robotic vision 189 f.3d at 1376 51 uspq2d at 1953
in addition when obviousness is based on particular prior_art references there must be a showing of a suggestion or motivation to combine the teachings of those references though it need not be expressly stated
see b.f. goodrich co. v. aircraft braking sys corp. 72_f.3d_1577 1582-83 37_uspq2d_1314 1318 fed.cir.1996 ; in re fine 837_f.2d_1071 1074 5_uspq2d_1596 1598-99 fed.cir.1988
in this case the district_court has accepted all of the special_masters findings of fact and the appellant does not challenge any of them
our task is to examine the findings related to the factors articulated in graham and determine whether the district_court erred by deciding that the claims were not obvious as a matter of law

( 1 scope and content of the prior_art and 2 difference between the prior_art and the claims
claim 1 of the806_patent contains four limitations an infeed conveyer an article selecting conveyor a carton conveyor and an article group transfer means
claim 13 incorporates all the subject_matter of claim 1 and adds a` cam_track/cam_follower_assembly' to the fourth element
according to the special_master riverwood stipulated that a patent in the prior *1367 art u.s. patent no._3778,959 to langen` the langen_patent' discloses the first three limitations of claim 1
see report at 10
the special_master found that the fourth limitation of claim 1 defines what is commonly known in the art as a` barrel_cam_loader' and that barrel_cam_loaders in cartoners were known in the prior_art
see id
the special_master also found that a` cam_track/cam_follower_assembly' is a common structure used in barrel_cam_loaders and concluded that` claim 13 [ would have been ] obvious for the same reasons as claim 1'
id.at 27
in addition the special_master found that langen` first disclosed in that patent angulated fixed guide rails stating that angulated fixed guides are an improvement overescalators barrel_cam_loaders not that escalators are not an obvious alternative..' id.at 11
upon examining the remainder of the prior_art the special_master found that the prior_art recognized the obviousness of substituting one type of loader for another in a cartoner
see id.at 11

( 3 level of skill in the art
the special_master found that one of ordinary_skill in the art` would be knowledgeable of problems and solutions to the design of cartoners' and that`.. the numerous prior patents in evidence show that there were numerous solutions developed to solve the problems and the solutions occurred relatively frequently in a relatively sophisticated and developed technology'
id.at 10 ; see pro-mold and tool co. v. great lakes plastics inc. 75_f.3d_1568 1573 37_uspq2d_1626 1630 fed.cir.1996
thus these findings support the conclusion that it would have been obvious to someone of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention to replace the angulated fixed guide rail loader in the langen_patent with a barrel_cam_loader and that a suggestion or motivation to make that substitution existed in the prior_art

( 4 objective factors
according to the special_master riverwood presented some evidence of commercial success
he found however that much of that success was attributable to factors outside the scope of claims 1_and_13 of the806_patent
see id.at 15 ; in re gpac 57_f.3d_1573 1580 35_uspq2d_1116 1121 fed.cir.1995` for objective_evidence to be accorded substantial weight its proponent must establish a nexus between the evidence and the merits of the claimed invention`
finally the special_master found that there is no evidence that the mead duostack was a copy of the twinstack cartoner that there was no long-felt need for an improvement in cartoners that was solved by the subject_matter of the claims of the806_patent and that there was no significant evidence of the failure of others
see report at 16
based on these findings he determined that the objective factors did not carry sufficient weight to override a conclusion of obviousness based on the primary considerations

in view of all these findings we are led to the ineluctable conclusion that claims 1_and_13 of the806_patent are invalid
the district_courts conclusion of nonobviousness is not supportable by the facts found

conclusion
accordingly the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of georgia is reversed
