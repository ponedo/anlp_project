taranto circuit_judge
cumberland_pharmaceuticals inc. owns u.s._patent_no._8399,445 which describes and claims acetylcysteine compositions substantially free of chelating agents
it is listed in the food and drug administrations approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations the orange book as covering cumberlands chelating-agent-free_formulation of acetadotethe_r an intravenous antidote for overdoses of acetaminophen
when mylan_institutional_llc filed an abbreviated new_drug_application to market its own chelating-agent-free acetylcysteine_formulation *1215 cumberland brought this patent-infringement_action in the northern_district of illinois against mylan_institutional_llc and mylan_inc. hereafter` mylan' individually or jointly
mylan stipulated to infringement but asserted invalidity on two grounds derivation of the claimed invention from someone at the fda and obviousness
the district_court rejected both challenges after a bench_trial
in particular the court found that mylan proved neither 1 that anyone at the fda conceived of the claimed invention before the patent-named inventor nor 2 that there was a reasonable_expectation that the claimed formulations without any chelating agents would succeed

i
a
at the priority_date relevant here august 24 2005 acetylcysteine was known in the art as an antidote for acetaminophen_overdoses
'445_patent col. 1 lines 20-34
it also was known to have a stability_problem heavy_metal_ions whether inherent in the formulation or found as contaminants catalyze the oxidation of acetylcysteine in solution causing it to degrade
id. col. 1 lines 39-40 ; see cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1112 n.2
a prior-art response to the stability_problem was to include edetate_disodium edta or edetate in an acetylcysteine_formulation
'445_patent col. 1 line 45 through col. 2 line 4
edta a chelating agent surrounds and binds to heavy_metal_ions preventing them from acting as catalysts that oxidize acetylcysteine
id
such edta-containing formulations of acetylcysteine were considered safe despite potential negative side effects
id. col. 2 lines 14-27

cumberlands445_patent declares` it has been surprisingly found that an aqueous composition containing acetylcysteine sterilized water and a ph-adjusting agent is stable without the addition of a chelating agent'
id. col. 2 lines 48-50
the patent claims such compositions
every claim in the patent requires a` stable' composition that is` free of chelating agents' id. col. 9 line 16 through col. 10 line 53 and the district_court construed the term to mean` [ l ] acking one or more chelating agents' cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1112

b
the facts central to the dispute over the445_patents validity date from 2002 when the fda was considering cumberlands application for permission to market the original edta-containing formulation of acetadotethe_r a formulation previously approved in other countries
on december 10 2002 the fda sent cumberland a letter in which the fda gave cumberland the following instructions among others` [ 2c ]
provide scientific and regulatory_justification for the inclusion of edetate as a component in the drug_product
in addition provide a description of the pharmacological_properties for edetate in this drug_product'
j.a
12837
six days later representatives of the fda and cumberland spoke by telephone
notes of the call state` regarding item 2 c the division explained that data should be provided to support any justification for the inclusion of edetate since a non-trivial amount is included in the formulation'
j.a
12899

on december 20 2002 cumberland formally responded to the fda in a letter written by leo pavliv who was the cumberland official responsible for acetadotethe_r and who is the named inventor on the *1216445_patent1 the letter explained that edta was included to stabilize the formulation and stated` if no or lower_concentrations of edetate are capable of ensuring product_stability lowering or removing edetate would raise questions of how the safety and efficacy of the product would be effected'
j.a
14783
mr._pavliv ultimately testified at trial that shortly after writing this letter he had the idea of testing the stability of an acetylcysteine_formulation without edta

on march_5,_2003 cumberland asked the fda to schedule a call for further discussion of its december 20 2002 response
with respect to question 2c cumberland proposed to discuss the following` cumberland believes the use of edetate as a component in the drug_product is justified both from a scientific as well as a regulatory point of view
does fda agree ?'
j.a
11343
there is no written record of the occurrence or content of the requested call
at trial however mr._pavliv testified that the call took place ; that fda_representatives indicated on the call that they were not prepared to say whether they considered edtas inclusion justified ; and that mr._pavliv then stated his idea to perform a stability_study
according to mr._pavliv at least one fda representative on the call approved of his idea to do a study and asked him to put the proposal in writing

cumberland did so in a july_21,_2003_letter stating` as requested by fda upon product approval [ i.e. upon fda_approval of the edta-containing formulation ] cumberland_pharmaceuticals intends to initiate studies to determine the impact on product_stability of both decreasing and completely removing edetate_disodium from the formulation'
j.a
14916
the fda issued its chemistry_review of the edta-containing formulation on january 9 2004
that document states` the sponsor reported that as requested by the fda upon drug approval an independent_study will be initiated to determine the impact on drug_product_stability of both decreasing and completely removing the amount of edetate_sodium'
j.a
12968 ; see id.at 12969 referring twice more to cumberlands commitment to a post-approval study
the fda approved the edta-containing product on january 23 2004 j.a
11334-37 with the approval letter reminding cumberland of its commitment to` evaluate the potential_benefit of edetate_disodium on the stability of the drug_product' the study to` include a comparison of the current_concentration of edetate to a formulation with a lower_concentration and no concentration of edetate'
id.at 11336

cumberland then arranged by contract for testing to be done by bioniche pharma group` mylans predecessor company'
cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1116
the protocol proposed by mr._pavliv and approved by the fda without change included testing a formulation that turned out to be the claimed invention i.e. a formulation containing neither edta nor any other chelating agent.2 on november 18 2004 three months into the study mr._pavliv received encouraging_stability_data
on august 24 2005 having received further encouraging_stability_data for a longer period cumberland filed its application *1217 for what became u.s._patent_no._8148,356 the parent of the445_patent at issue here

cumberland gave the fda the final results of the stability_study containing data for thirty-six months on august 13 2008
it then set about securing approval to market an edta-free_version of acetadotethe_r
the fda approved that product in january 2011

c. on december 19 2011 mylan filed an abbreviated new_drug_application seeking permission to market a generic version of cumberlands edta-free acetylcysteine product
shortly thereafter on february 27 2012 cumberland filed the divisional application that became the445_patent
when the356_patent issued on april_3,_2012 mylan sent cumberland a certification pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv that the356_patent was either invalid or not infringed by mylans proposed product

on may_17,_2012 cumberland sued mylan for infringement of the356_patent pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a
the445_patent issued on march_19,_2013 and cumberland then amended its complaint to add allegations of infringement of the445_patent
on august 4 2014 mylan stipulated to infringement of claims 1-14 of the445_patent should they be held valid and enforceable
cumberland withdrew its claims regarding the356_patent on september 28 2014

at the bench_trial mylan argued that 1 the445_patent had been derived from someone at the fda on the theory that it was someone at the fda not mr._pavliv who first had the idea to remove edta from the prior-art formulation and 2 the invention would have been obvious in light of certain prior-art communications from the fda
the district_court held that 1 mylan had not proved that anyone at the fda conceived of the invention before cumberlands inventor did cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1121-22 and 2 there was no reasonable_expectation that a formulation without any chelating agents would be successful given the prevailing skilled-artisan view that chelating agents were necessary to prevent degradation of acetylcysteine id.at 1127
the court entered a final judgment of validity and infringement on november 17 2015
we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

in this case as the derivation issue was litigated it suffices to focus on the fact that the required complete conception had to include the specific idea to remove edta from acetadotethe_r or a similar product that met all the other445 claim elements and not add another chelating agent
it was that idea which mylan had to show by clear and convincing_evidence was conceived by someone at the fda and communicated to mr._pavliv
see amax_fly_ash_corp. 514 f.2d at 1048

the district_court found that mylan did not carry that burden
after considering the` surprising paucity of direct evidence' cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1120 the district_court concluded that while` the evidence does not establish a precise date of conception by pavliv'` mylan has failed to persuade the court that anyone other than pavliv ever conceived of adefinite and permanent_idea of an edta-free acetadote formulation' id.at 1121-22
given the claim_language requiring that the product be` free of chelating agents'445_patent col. 9 lines 20-21 not just edta and the district_courts several_references to that particular claim requirement cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1112-13 discussing the claim limitation` free of chelating agents' ; id.at 1123-24 same we *1219 think it clear that the district_courts finding refers to a formulation of acetadotethe_r that simply removes edta without adding another chelating agent in its place
the court thus found that mylan did not prove that an fda person conceived of that formulation or communicated it to cumberland before mr._pavliv thought of it

the evidence supports the finding
the court could properly view the fdas december 10 2002 letter which simply requested justification for the inclusion of edta in the drug_product as not showing the prior_conception needed here
j.a
12837` [ 2 c ] provide scientific and regulatory_justification for the inclusion of edetate as a component in the drug_product
in addition provide a description of the pharmacological_properties for edetate in this drug_product`
a different view is not required by the notes of the december 16 2002 call which add only that the fda wanted data to support the justification
j.a
12899` regarding item 2 c the division explained that data should be provided to support any justification for the inclusion of edetate since a non-trivial amount is included in the formulation`
a request for justification of the inclusion of edta supported by data is not the same as a suggestion to remove it let alone to remove it and not replace it with another chelating agent

mylan argues that the request for data to support the inclusion of edta required cumberland to undertake research that would have inevitably led it to the invention
that is not enough for derivation
we have held that derivation is not proved by showing conception and communication of an idea different from the claimed invention even where that idea would make the claimed idea obvious
gambro lundia 110 f.3d at 1577-78
we also have made clear that a` general_goal or research_plan' does not constitute the` definite and permanent_idea' required for conception burroughs wellcome 40 f.3d at 1228 and that a` bare hope' of a result` never before.. achieved' here the claimed` stable' compound is not sufficient for conception hitzeman v. rutter 243_f.3d_1345 1356-57 fed
cir
2001
see cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1121
the kind of general research suggestion at issue here whatever its role in an obviousness analysis does not establish the conception required for derivation

the evidence dating from after december 2002 likewise does not compel a finding contrary to the district_courts
in particular even when documents go beyond discussing a study of whether edtas inclusion is justified and mention removing edta they do not make clear either that all chelating agents were to be avoided or that even the edta-removal idea whether or not a substitute was to be added came from someone other than mr._pavliv
all of those documents postdate the conversation mr._pavliv had with fda_representatives in which he testified he was the one who introduced the idea of testing an edta-free product

thus several cumberland documents starting with the july_21,_2003_letter quoted above j.a
14916 refer to the fda as having` requested' the study
but that language can be read as focusing on the fdas request for a study implementing the idea already suggested by mr._pavliv
see j.a
11263 cumberlands apr._19,_2004 proposed study_protocol` as part of a post approval marketing commitment the fda requested cumberland investigate whether edta has a beneficial impact on stability and if so whether the level could be reduced
`` ; j.a
11311 cumberlands aug._13,_2008 final report from stability_study` the fda expressed a potential_safety_concern with edta in the *1220 formulation and as such requested cumberland investigate whether edta provided a stability_benefit or could be reduced or removed from the product
`` ; j.a
11360 cumberlands may_10,_2011 draft clinical study_protocol for edta-free acetadotethe_r` the fda expressed a potential_safety_concern with edta in the formulation of acetadote and requested that the manufacturer investigate whether edta provided a stability_benefit or could be reduced or removed from the product
`` ; j.a
11693 cumberlands may_18,_2012 citizen petition` from the outset fda wanted cumberland to investigate reducing or removing edta from acetadotethe_r because the agency was concerned with the safety of edta
the agency should not now approve an anda for acetadotethe_r that relies on the discontinued formulation that is less safe than the edta-free_formulation that fda specifically requested cumberland investigate developing and that is currently on the market
``

indeed the fdas january 9 2004 chemistry_review after stating that` [ t ] he sponsor reported that as requested by fda.. an independent_study will be initiated to determine the impact on drug_product_stability of both decreasing and completely removing the amount of edetate_sodium' j.a
12968 adds that the study was` applicant proposed' j.a
12969
as that document confirms it is entirely possible for cumberland to have first proposed the idea of studying edta_removal as mr._pavliv testified and for the fda to have` requested' that cumberland actually perform that study
and as with the december 2002 communications none of these documents establish that the fda specifically conceived of removing edta from the prior-art acetadotethe_r without adding any other chelating agents as required by the claim_language

mylan gets no further help in reversing the district_courts finding from the fdas reliance on cumberlands commitment to perform the study in approving the edta-containing product in 2004
it simply does not follow from the fact that the study ultimately became a commitment recited in the 2004 fda_approval that it was someone at the fda who originally proposed the study let alone conceived of the invention eventually claimed in the445_patent
the district_court could properly find that the study_requirement in the approval_letter did not specify that cumberland must test an edta-free_formulation of acetylcysteine without adding any other chelating agents
cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1123` most importantly the reference to cumberlands commitment to study the removal of edta from acetadote nowhere specifies that the exact same drug formulation without edta must be used`
the study_requirement in total reads commit to evaluate the potential_benefit of edetate_disodium on the stability of the drug_product
the study shall include a comparison of the current_concentration of edetate to a formulation with a lower_concentration and no concentration of edetate
generate stability_data from the new proposed formulations including compatibility stability with infusion bags
j.a
11336
as the district_court explained` a formulation could contain for instance a chelating agent other than edta
this composition would be free of edta and satisfy the study_requirement but would not befree of chelating agents.. which every claim of the445_patent requires'
cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1123-24 citation omitted
consistent with this conclusion cumberland provided testimony that there were many possible ways to meet this commitment including adding other chelating agents or testing *1221 without the claimed` airtight container' containing inert gas and there was documentary evidence that it was mr._pavliv who came up with the precise protocol that amounted to a reduction to practice of the445_patents invention

mylan does not contend that anyone at the fda rather than mr._pavliv drafted the study_protocol that resulted in the claimed invention though it does point out that the protocol mr._pavliv chose was the same protocol used to confirm the stability of edta-containing acetadotethe_r
instead mylan takes the position that the communications between the fda and cumberland which all require` removing or reducing' edta from` the' formulation or` the' drug_product must refer to the approved edta-containing product ; thus according to mylan the study_requirement is not open to an interpretation that would allow a relevant skilled_artisan to do anything other than arrive at the claimed invention free of chelating agents
but the use of the definite article need not do so much work as to direct a skilled_artisan to remove edta add nothing else and test the resulting formulation in exactly the manner to lead to the invention
indeed mylans theory would appear to prove too much cumberlands december 20 2002 letter referred to the effect on` the product' if it turned out that` no or lower_concentrations of edetate are capable of ensuring product_stability' and cumberlands july_21,_2003_letter also refers to` completely removing edetate_disodium from the formulation'
j.a
14783 14916 emphases added
if reference to removing edta from` the' formulation is enough we do not see why cumberlands evidence would not suffice to show that mr._pavliv the author of the december 20 2002 and july_21,_2003_letters first conceived of the invention

for those reasons we affirm the district_courts determination that mylan did not clearly and convincingly show that mr._pavliv derived the invention of the445_patent from someone at the fda

b
we also affirm the district_courts rejection of mylans obviousness_challenge
mylan relies for this challenge on the edta-containing acetadotethe_r and its package_insert-which mylan asserts include or teach all of the elements of the invention except the removal of edta-together with several_references that allegedly bridge the gap to reach the claimed chelating-agent-free_version of an acetylcysteine product
specifically mylan relies on a the fdas january 9 2004 chemistry_review and january 23 2004 approval_letter each of which it asserts motivates removal of edta by stating cumberlands commitment to study edtas role ; and b u.s. patent pub
no._2004 /0022873 to guilford which describes intravenous acetylcysteine_formulations for treating bioterror exposures.4 those contentions we conclude do not undermine the district_courts rejection of mylans obviousness_challenge

`` a party seeking to invalidate a patent on the basis of obviousness must demonstrate by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so'

`` the reasonable_expectation of success requirement refers to the likelihood of success in combining references to meet the limitations of the claimed invention'
intelligent_bio-systems 821 f.3d at 1367
here stability is an express claim requirement
the district_court in this case wrote` the courts review of the evidence supports the conclusion that persons of ordinary_skill in the art would have assumed that edta or some other chelating agent was necessary to maintain stability in an acetylcysteine_formulation'
cumberland 137 f.supp.3d at 1125
it added` given that all prior acetylcysteine_formulations contained edta and given that the prior art taught that edta or another chelating agent was necessary to stabilize the formulation the court rejects the argument that the approval_letter or chemistry_review which contained the edta study commitments would reasonably lead to a stable acetylcysteine_formulation'
id.at 1126
though not using the exact phrase` reasonable_expectation of success' the court thus found that the hypothetical relevant skilled_artisan would not have reasonably expected a chelating-agent-free intravenous acetylcysteine_formulation to succeed in being stable a claim requirement
id.at 1125

that finding is not clearly erroneous
considerable evidence supports the finding that relevant_skilled_artisans believed that chelating agents were necessary to sequester metal_contaminants and prevent oxidative_degradation of acetylcysteine and that such artisans had no reasonable_expectation of stability without such an agent

13324 hamlow observing that` data show that acetylcysteine solution containing the chelating agent edta is well protected from oxidative_degradation'
as late as 2011 mylans own scientists expressed concern that the removal of edta would make the product more vulnerable to oxidation
e.g. j.a
14346 email noting the` risk' that` removing edta will open up sensitivity to heavy_metals at low ppm levels in solution' and proposing experiments to determine sources and effects of heavy_metals in the proposed product ; j.a

``

mylan offered evidence tending to show that there is no need to chelate trace metal ions because degradation may be effectively *1223 avoided by an inert vial atmosphere together with modern manufacturing practices that leave very low_levels of metal_contaminants
but mylans evidence did not compel a finding that relevant_skilled_artisans would have reasonably expected success for those reasons in 2005
the district_court had sufficient evidence to find otherwise
in addition to the already-cited evidence we note the pre-2005 references indicating that even very small amounts of metal and oxygen could result in degradation
