because the district_court did not err in its conclusions we affirm

background
a
the claimed and accused processes
the941_patent is directed to processes for creating low-cost ornamental_concrete_surfaces
the written description discloses for example that the claimed processes can be used to create an imitation brick surface on a concrete substrate at considerably lower cost than inlaying actual bricks into that substrate
see941_patent col._1,_ll._52-58
claim 6 the only claim at issue depends from independent_claim 5 and claims the following process 5
a process for coating a substrate with a decorative_surface comprising mixing a first_batch of liquid_mortar consisting of a mixture of cement sand and an aqueous_solution of adhesive_resin and applying a first_layer of said liquid_mortar to said surface ; allowing said first_layer to cure ; providing a flexible_template_panel having a pattern of desired grout_lines an adhesive_layer and a backing_layer ; removing said backing_layer to expose said adhesive_layer ; securing said template to said first_layer ; mixing a second_batch of cement sand and an aqueous_solution of adhesive_resin including also a color_pigment contrasting with the color of said first_batch ; applying a second_layer of said second_batch of liquid_mortar over said first_layer and said template and allowing said second_layer to fully dry ; removing said template with any part of said second_layer immediately above said template and allowing said second_layer to finish curing ; and
applying a coat of concrete_sealer_material over said first and second_mortar_layers
6
a process as claimed in claim 5 wherein said flexible_template is of heavy_wax_impregnated_paper with adhesive_backing
*1362941_patent col._7,_l._13 to col._8,_l._14 paragraphing added
figures 8_and_11 of the941_patent which have been slightly modified for clarity depict several of the key steps in the claimed process as follows

?
in brief a first_batch of liquid_mortar is mixed and applied to substrate 40 to form first_mortar_layer 42
after that layer cures an adhesive backed wax impregnated template 44 is secured to the first_mortar_layer 42 after the templates adhesive_backing is removed
a second_batch of liquid_mortar is mixed and applied over template 44 and first_mortar_layer 42 to form the second_mortar_layer 46
that second_layer is allowed to dry and template 44 is removed
the second_mortar_layer 46 is allowed to cure and a sealant coat is applied to the finished product

the accused processes hill_brothers` desert crete' process and omegas` decostone' process follow essentially the same steps set forth in claim 6
the only difference between the accused and claimed processes is that the template used in the accused processes is comprised of` polycoat_paper' instead of` heavy_wax_impregnated_paper'

b
the district court
ultra-tex sued hill_brothers and omega hereinafter` hill_brothers' alleging infringement of all eight claims of the941_patent
hill_brothers moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement on the grounds that claims 1-8 were invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 a b f g and 103 a
see ultra-tex surfaces inc. v. hill_bros._chem co. nos
sa_cv 96-1230 -1232 glt eex c.d.cal
july_7,_1998 order denying defendants motion for summary_judgment
in response ultra-tex filed a statutory disclaimer in the patent and trademark office` pto' disclaiming all but claim 6 of the941_patent
see id.at 2
focusing exclusively on hill_brothers anticipation arguments under ¡± 102 a and obviousness arguments under ¡± 103 the district_court denied hill_brothers motion concluding that genuine issues of material fact existed relating to both grounds of invalidity
see id.at 3-10
shortly thereafter a bench trial was commenced on july_28,_1998

following a six-day trial the district_court announced its findings of fact and conclusions of law from the bench
the court found no literal infringement see tr.at 963 a finding not challenged on appeal
in its doctrine of equivalents infringement analysis the court applied the` function way result' methodology described in graver tank & manufacturing co. v. linde air products co. 339_u.s._605 608 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097 85_uspq_328 330 1950 and found that the polycoat_paper_template used in the accused process *1363 the only feature distinguishing the claimed and accused processes was prima facie an equivalent of a heavy_wax impregnated template
see tr.at 963
the court then employed the hypothetical_claim methodology that we established in wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & associates 904_f.2d_677 14_uspq2d_1942 fed.cir.1990 to determine whether the scope of equivalents asserted by ultra-tex would impermissibly ensnare the prior_art
having found that a polycoat_template was simply a paper_template coated with polyethylene the district_court held as a matter of law that a hypothetical_claim encompassing the accused process would read on identical prior_art processes using such templates
see tr.at 963-69
accordingly the court held that hill_brothers was not liable for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
the court also held that hill_brothers failed to prove that claim 6 was anticipated or would have been obvious under ¡± 103 a
see id.at 972-74

ultra-tex appealed the district_courts noninfringement ruling and hill_brothers cross-appealed the courts ruling that claim 6 was not invalid under ¡± 103 a
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 1994

discussion
a
standard of review
determining whether an accused process or device infringes a patent claim is a two-step process
`` the first step is claim construction which involves ascertaining the scope and meaning of the claims at issue while the second step involves determining whether the claims as construed read on the accused device'
streamfeeder llc v. sure-feed sys inc. 175_f.3d_974 981 50_uspq2d_1515 1519 fed.cir.1999
claim construction is a question of law that we review de novo
see cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1456 46_uspq2d_1169 1174 fed.cir.1998 en banc
infringement either literal or under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact that we review for clear error when tried without a jury
see insituform techs. inc. v. cat contracting inc. 161_f.3d_688 692 48_uspq2d_1610 1614 fed.cir.1998
whether an asserted scope of equivalents would impinge on prior_art is an issue of law that we review de novo
see wilson 904 f.2d at 683-84 14 uspq2d at 1948

b
infringement
ultra-tex argues that the district_court erred in holding that hill_brothers did not infringe claim 6 under the doctrine of equivalents
ultra-tex first asserts that the court erred in finding that the accused process used a polyethylene_coated_paper_template
ultra-tex contends that while there was testimony that the polycoat_template employed by the accused process was made of polyethylene coated paper that testimony was self-interested and biased and hill_brothers otherwise failed to present any competent_evidence on that issue
ultra-tex also argues that the court erred by failing to consider all the limitations of its proposed hypothetical_claim and thereby evaluated an unpatentably broad hypothetical_claim

hill_brothers responds that the district_court did not err in holding that it was not liable for infringement
hill_brothers contends that it was ultra-texs burden to prove the composition of the accused template as the party alleging infringement and that in any event the testimony of ultra-texs former employee vincent_chacon supports the courts finding that the accused process used a polyethylene_coated_paper_template
we understand hill_brothers to further argue that the court properly disregarded the limitations that ultra-tex added to claim 6 via its hypothetical_claim especially since they lack any support in the specification and correctly held as a matter of law that the *1364 hypothetical_claim was unpatentably broad

as an initial matter it is beyond dispute that ultra-tex bore the burden of proving the composition of the accused template
while ultra-tex argues that hill_brothers failed to prove the composition of the accused template it is axiomatic that the patentee bears the burden of proving infringement
see e.g. carroll touch inc. v. electro mechanical sys. inc. 15_f.3d_1573 1578 27_uspq2d_1836 1840 fed.cir.1993
ultra-tex accurately indicates that the record evidence on the composition of` polycoat' is scant but ultra-tex is itself responsible for this shortcoming ; the only record evidence on the identity of polycoat was provided by hill_brothers the accused infringer.1

ultra-tex is thus left to argue that the district_court accorded improper weight to hill_brothers evidence on the polycoat issue ; we agree with hill_brothers that these arguments are unavailing
in support of hill_brothers contention that its polycoat_paper_template was comprised of paper coated with polyethylene vincent_chacon who had previously ordered polycoat_templates for ultra-tex,2 testified that the terms` polycoat' and` polyethylene coated' are used interchangeably
see tr.at 517
he further testified that his understanding of the meaning of the term` polycoat' was based on information from fox paper an ultra-tex supplier which had informed him that the polycoat_paper that he had ordered was paper coated with polyethylene
see id.at 524
ultra-tex argues that the district_court erred in according that testimony any weight because chacon was an interested witness and was biased against ultra-tex for being named a defendant in the lawsuit
even if these allegations were true they go to the weight to be accorded the evidence by the fact-finder a matter not readily reversed by an appellate court
in any event in the absence of any contrary evidence regarding the composition of the accused template from the party charged with proving that fact we conclude that the district_court did not clearly err in finding that polycoat is simply paper coated with polyethylene

turning to the courts hypothetical_claim_analysis we agree with hill_brothers that the court properly held as a matter of law that a hypothetical_claim covering hill_brothers processes would impermissibly ensnare the prior_art
hypothetical claim analysis provides a practical methodology for determining whether a claim that has been` broadened' under the doctrine of equivalents impermissibly ensnares the prior_art in its newly expanded form
see wilson 904 f.2d at 684 14 uspq2d at 1948.3 under a hypothetical_claim_analysis a patentee proposes a hypothetical_claim that is sufficiently broad in scope to literally encompass the accused product or process
see id
if that claim would have been allowed by the pto over the prior_art then the prior_art *1365 does not bar the application of the doctrine of equivalents
see marquip inc. v. fosber am. inc. 198_f.3d_1363 1367 53_uspq2d_1015 1018 fed.cir.1999
conversely if that claim would not have been allowed the prior_art bars application of the doctrine and infringement by equivalence may not be found
see id

despite the utility of this methodology in streamfeeder we emphasized that hypothetical_claim_analysis is not a vehicle for a patentee to` freely redraft granted claims' by expanding some limitations in order to read on an accused process or device while narrowing other limitations to avoid prior_art
see streamfeeder 175 f.3d at 983 50 uspq2d at 1521
we also explained that while the accused infringer must come forward with evidence that the hypothetical_claim reads on the prior_art once the patentee makes out a prima facie case of infringement by equivalence the ultimate_burden of persuasion rests on the patentee to show that the hypothetical_claim does not read on the prior_art
see id.at 982-83 175_f.3d_974 50 uspq2d at 1520-21

in the present case ultra-tex provided the district_court with a hypothetical_claim derived from claim 6 with deletions represented by brackets and additions indicated by underscore 5
a process for coating a substrate with a decorative_surface having clean_distinct_grout_lines comprising mixing a first_batch of liquid_mortar consisting of a mixture of cement sand and an aqueous_solution of adhesive_resin and applying a first_layer of said liquid_mortar to said surface ; allowing said first_layer to cure ; providing a flexible_template_panel which is substantially impervious to water having a pattern of desired grout_lines an adhesive_layer and a backing_layer ; removing said backing_layer to expose said adhesive_layer ; securing said template to said first_layer ; mixing a second_batch of cement sand and an aqueous_solution of adhesive_resin including also a color_pigment contrasting with the color of said first_batch ; [ applying ] troweling a second_layer of said second_batch of liquid_mortar over said first_layer and said template [ and ] without first spraying said second_batch within said template said template adheres to said first cemented layer tightly enough to avoid infiltration of the second_layer material between the first_layer-template bond ; allowing said second_layer to fully dry ; removing said template with any part of said second_layer immediately above said template [ and ] wherein said template withstands mechanical pressure so as to remain in tact [ sic ] during removal of the template ; allowing said second_layer to finish curing ; and
applying a coat of concrete_sealer_material over said first and second_mortar_layers
[ 6
a process as claimed in claim 5 wherein said flexible_template is of heavy_wax_impregnated_paper with adhesive_backing ]
ex.app.at 324
as made clear by the abundant bracketing and underscoring ultra-tex made considerable alterations to original_claim 6
in effect claim 6 was deleted and only a modified claim 5 remained
the limitation specifying template composition i.e. the` heavy_wax_impregnated_paper' limitation was deleted
at the same_time four limitations were added
the claimed process now must create a decorative_surface with` clean_distinct_grout_lines' and the template now must 1 be` substantially impervious to water' 2 prevent bleeding` of the second *1366 layer material between the first_layer template bond' and 3` withstand [ ] mechanical pressure' i.e. not tear upon removal

upon consideration of this hypothetical_claim we conclude that the district_court correctly held as a matter of law that such a claim would read on the prior_art
we first note that as in streamfeeder ultra-tex used hypothetical analysis to` freely redraft' its claim by impermissibly broadening and narrowing it at the same_time a practice our case law clearly forbids while use of a hypothetical_claim may permit a minor extension of a claim to cover subject_matter that is substantially equivalent to that literally claimed one can not in the course of litigation and outside of the pto cut and trim expanding here and narrowing there to arrive at a claim that encompasses an accused device but avoids the prior_art
slight broadening is permitted at that point but not narrowing
streamfeeder 175 f.3d at 983 50 uspq2d at 1521.4 thus the hypothetical_claim is only a device for limited not substantial inclusion of unclaimed subject_matter and not for exclusion of unduly limiting subject_matter
the claim created by ultra-tex here does not pass muster

however even if we view the hypothetical_claim with the added limitations that narrowed original_claim 6 it is clear that ultra-texs hypothetical_claim would not have been allowed by the pto as the accused process that it encompasses was in public_use more than one year prior to the january 3 1994 filing date of the941 application
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b 1994` a person shall be entitled to a patent unless.. the invention was.. in public_use or on sale in this country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states..' ; in re epstein 32_f.3d_1559 1564 31_uspq2d_1817 1820 fed.cir.1994` the section 102 bpublic_use andon sale bars are not limited to sales or uses by the inventor or one under the inventors control but may result from activities of a third party which anticipate the invention or render it obvious`
an invalidating public_use is just as damaging to the patentability of a proposed hypothetical_claim as any other type of prior_art

hill_brothers presented the testimony of numerous individuals in the ornamental concrete art along with corroborating evidence to support its contention that its processes were in the prior_art
we need only focus on the testimony of david maietta the president and chief executive officer of multicoat corporation and the evidence corroborating his testimony
maietta testified that multicoat had practiced the accused process i.e. the process recited in independent_claim 5 using a polyethylene coated adhesive backed paper_template prior to 1993
see tr.at 401-403 413
hill_brothers corroborated maiettas testimony with samples of the template used in multicoats process as well as a december 22 1992 letter from artcrete inc. multicoats supplier indicating that it was sending sample templates with different adhesive_backings for use in multicoats process
see ex.app.at 184/sa4 185/sa5 198

thus hill_brothers satisfied its burden of production by presenting considerable evidence that ultra-texs hypothetical_claim would not have been allowed by the *1367 pto
because ultra-tex did little more than allege that hill_brothers had failed to satisfy its burden ultra-tex failed to satisfy its ultimate_burden of persuasion to the contrary
accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not err in holding that hill_brothers was not liable for infringement of claim 6
we have considered all the other arguments raised by ultra-tex but do not find them persuasive

c. invalidity
in its cross-appeal hill_brothers argues that the district_court erred in failing to hold claim 6 invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
hill_brothers specifically contends that the claim 6 process would have been obvious over u.s._patent 4,975,303 in view of u.s._patent 4,510,729
hill_brothers further asserts that ultra-texs objective_considerations of nonobviousness are not probative on that issue as ultra-tex failed to establish a nexus between those considerations and the claimed invention and no competent_evidence supports their existence
ultra-tex responds that the court properly held that hill_brothers had failed to rebut the presumption of validity of claim 6 noting that hill_brothers failed to submit any prior_art that is more pertinent than the303 and729_patent s which had been considered by the examiner when he allowed claim 6
ultra-tex also argues that its alleged objective_considerations of nonobviousness are supported by the required nexus and that competent_evidence does in fact support them

an accused infringer alleging that a claim is invalid must overcome the statutory presumption of validity that attaches to an issued patent see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 1994 by proving invalidity by facts supported by clear and convincing evidence
see robotic vision sys. inc. v. view eng g inc. 189_f.3d_1370 1377 51_uspq2d_1948 1953 fed.cir.1999
in american_hoist & derrick co. v. sowa & sons inc. we explained that when a party alleges that a claim is invalid based on the very same references that were before the examiner when the claim was allowed that party assumes the following additional burden when no prior_art other than that which was considered by the pto examiner is relied on by the attacker he has the added burden of overcoming the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have properly done its job which includes one or more examiners who are assumed to have some expertise in interpreting the references and to be familiar from their work with the level of skill in the art and whose duty it is to issue only valid patents
american_hoist 725_f.2d_1350 1359 220_uspq_763 770 fed.cir.1984 ; see also kloster speedsteel ab v. crucible inc. 793_f.2d_1565 1571 230_uspq_81 84 fed.cir.1986

aside from its basic contention that the district_court erred in not holding the patent invalid based on the combination of the303 and729_patent s hill_brothers offers no serious argument as to how the district_court erred in accepting the examiners interpretation of the prior_art references as they relate to claim 6
as for the other prior_art processes presented by hill_brothers it is undisputed that none of those processes employed a wax impregnated template
accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not err in concluding that claim 6 was not proved invalid under ¡± 103 a and need not address hill_brothers arguments relating to the objective_considerations of nonobviousness

conclusion
the district_court correctly concluded that ultra texs hypothetical_claim reads *1368 on the prior_art and that therefore hill_brothers did not infringe claim 6 under the doctrine of equivalents
the court also did not err in concluding that hill failed to overcome the presumption of validity associated with claim 6
accordingly we

affirm

as we recently acknowledged in streamfeeder the doctrine of equivalents does not operate to` broaden' claims but rather broadens the right to exclude
see streamfeeder 175 f.3d at 981_n._1 50 uspq2d at 1520_n._1
for the sake of convenience however we will likewise use these terms here` cognizant of the fact that it is the right to exclude which is being expanded not the claims'

our decision in streamfeeder had not yet issued at the time the district_court rendered its oral decision from the bench
nevertheless the district_court displayed considerable prescience in its hypothetical_claim_analysis noting that ultra-texs heavily redrafted hypothetical_claim was of questionable merit
