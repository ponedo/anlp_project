prost circuit_judge
plaintiffs mitsubishi-tokyo_pharmaceuticals inc. and abbott_laboratories appeal the decision of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois granting defendants dey l.p. and dey inc. summary_judgment of noninfringement of u.s._patent_no._4397,839` the ¡¬839_patent`
because the district_court improperly precluded plaintiffs from relying on the doctrine of equivalents to prove infringement we vacate the judgment of noninfringement and remand for further_proceedings in accordance with this opinion

background
i. tokyo tanabe company ltd. now known as mitsubishi-tokyo_pharmaceuticals inc. and its exclusive united_states licensee abbott_laboratories collectively` abbott' sued dey l.p. and dey inc. collectively` dey' for infringement of the ¡¬839_patent and u.s._patent_no._4338,301` the ¡¬301_patent`
these patents relate to a lung_surfactant_composition for treating respiratory_distress_syndrome in premature_babies
the ¡¬301_patent filed on may_21,_1980 represents the work of drs
fujiwara tanaka and takei in developing a surfactant having the desirable properties of rapid_spreading in the lungs and of reducing ultra-alveolar surface tension
claim 1 of the ¡¬ 301 patent reads as follows surface active_material containing phospholipid neutral lipid total_cholesterol carbohydrate protein and water which material is obtained from lung_tissue of a mammal with or without further phospholipid characterized in that the phospholipid_content is 75.0-95.5 % the neutral lipid content is 1.8-14.0 % the total_cholesterol_content is 0.0-3.0 % the carbohydrate_content is 0.1-1.5 % the protein_content is 0.5-5.0 % and water_content is 1.7-6.0 % all based on the dried weight of said material the minimum and maximum surface tension ranges of the material estimated by wilhelmys method wherein the material is added dropwise to the surface of physiological_saline in an amount of 0.3-0.8 £gg per square_centimeter of surface_area thereof being 2.1-8.6 dynes/cm and 48.2-58.0 dynes/cm when surface_areas are 21.big_token__0_cm_2__big_token and 45.big_token__6_cm_2__big_token respectively
¡¬301_patent col._17,_l._59 col._18,_l._6 emphasis added

the ¡¬301_patent ed surfactant was based on a composition labeled` ta-546'
dr._tanaka one of the three inventors of the ¡¬301_patent` continued confirmatory studies on ta-546' and` discover [ ed ] that several important properties i.e. surface tension-reducing capacity spreadability over a liquid surface and adsorbability to a gas-liquid interface of ta-546 can be enhanced by increasing the relative_amount or content of free_fatty_acids to 1.0-27.7 % based on the total weight of ta-546'
¡¬839_patent col. 1 ll.36-44 emphasis added
ta-546 contained less than 1.0 %_free_fatty_acid although the ¡¬301_patent makes no mention of this fact
id.at col._1,_ll._37-38 ; ¡¬301_patent col. 5 table i. dr._tanakas *1100 discovery of the benefits of adding free_fatty_acids led him to file a new patent application on march_4,_1982 four months before the ¡¬301_patent issued on july_6,_1982
this new application issued as the ¡¬839_patent on august 9 1983
claim 1 of the ¡¬839_patent reads a surface_active_material comprising 1 phospholipid neutral_fat total_cholesterol free_fatty_acids carbohydrate protein and water all of which are obtained from the lung_tissue of a mammal and 2 optionally at least one additional component selected from the group consisting of a phosphatidylcholine a neutral_fat and a free_fatty_acid characterized in that the overall phospholipid_content is 68.6 90.7 % the overall neutral_fat content is 0.3-13.0 % the total_cholesterol_content is 0.0-8.0 % the overall free_fatty_acid content is 1.0-27.7 % the carbohydrate_content is 0.1-2.0 % the protein_content is 0.0-3.5 % and the water_content is 2.1-5.2 % all based on the dry_weight of the material the surface tension of the material as measured at 15¢X-25¢Xc
by wilhelmys method in which the material is added dropwise to the surface of physiological_saline in an amount of 0.3-0.8 £gg per square_centimeter of the surface_area thereof being 30.1-47.5 dynes/cm when the surface_area is 54.big_token__0_cm_2__big_token
¡¬839_patent col._17,_ll._13-31 emphases added

the application for the ¡¬839_patent was filed as a separate and independent application-not as a continuation divisional or continuation-in-part of the ¡¬ 301 application even though the ¡¬301_application was pending at the time the ¡¬ 839 application was filed and the applications shared common subject_matter a common_inventor and the same assignee
the same examiner also examined both the ¡¬839 and ¡¬301_applications
he initially rejected the pending claims of the ¡¬301_patent as being among other_things prima facie obvious in light of three prior_art articles
march_17,_1981 examiners action at p. 2
in response to this rejection the applicants argued as follows the inventors of the invention covered by this application have studied the suggestions of these three references and discovered through experimentation that only a surface-active_material having the chemical_composition claimed and disclosed at table i at page 4 of the application under the heading` composition of the material' have the property of rapid_spreading and of ultra-alveolar surface tension reduction
the results obtained are caused by the particular and novel surface-active agent isolated the method of using this agent on the ailment hmd and the method of isolating the particular surface-active_material
accordingly it is believed all of the claims define a patentable invention over the cited references whether these references are taken separately or in combination
july_1,_1981 amendment at pp
8-9 emphasis added
after issuing a final rejection based on 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ? ?
1_and_2 which was overcome by a september 3 1981 amendment after final_rejection the examiner issued a notice of allowance on december 17 1981.1

the ¡¬839_application was filed on march_4,_1982 approximately three months after the examiner allowed the claims of the ¡¬301_application but before the ¡¬ 301 patent *1101 had issued
the examiner allowed the claims of the ¡¬839_application` because this application is an improvement over previously allowed patent claims ; and no prior_art was found which anticipates or makes obvious the instant claims'

the ¡¬839 and ¡¬301_patent s have been involved in prior litigation before our court
in forest_laboratories inc. v. abbott_laboratories 239_f.3d_1305 57_uspq2d_1794_(fed.cir.2001) this court considered whether the district_court erroneously granted forest a judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law following a jury verdict of infringement
we affirmed the district_courts decision because the jurys verdict was not supported by substantial evidence
abbott failed to present any evidence that the accused products met the water limitation of the claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
id.at 1312-13 57 uspq2d at 1799-1800
we also stated that the above quoted argument from the ¡¬301 prosecution_history was` an unmistakable assertion made to the pto in support of patentability..
accordingly [ abbott ] is estopped from asserting that the percentage of water in the surface_active_material is irrelevant'

abbott began marketing the drug survantathe_r in 1991 pursuant to its exclusive license under the ¡¬301 and ¡¬839_patent s. prior to the advent of survantathe_r neonatal respiratory_distress_syndrome had been a leading cause of death among premature infants
on november 19 1999 dey obtained approval from the united_states food and drug administration to market the surfactant curosurfthe_r
curosurfthe_r is manufactured in italy by chiesi farmaceutici s.p.a. and imported and offered for sale in the united_states by dey
dey first began offering curosurfthe_r for sale in the united_states on february 14 2000

abbott sued dey on march_21,_2000 for infringement of the ¡¬301 and ¡¬839_patent s seeking damages and a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting dey from using selling or offering curosurfthe_r for sale in the united_states
dey counterclaimed for a declaratory_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity
on may_19,_2000 abbott formally moved for a preliminary_injunction based only on the ¡¬839_patent because the ¡¬301_patent expired six days later on may_25,_2000
beginning on july_6,_2000 the district_court held an evidentiary hearing on abbotts motion
abbott attempted to prove infringement under the doctrine of equivalents conceding that curosurfthe_r did not literally meet claim 1s limitation of 68.6 % 90.7 %_phospholipid
abbotts tests of the curosurfthe_r paste found that one sample contained 91.8 %_phospholipid while another sample contained 94.5 %_phospholipid
abbott presented expert_testimony that the phospholipid_content of curosurfthe_r was insubstantially different from the phospholipid component of the claimed surfactant because` 95 percent [ phospholipid ] would work exactly the same' as the claimed phospholipid amount
abbotts expert also testified that` it really does n't matter whether it is 80_or_85 or 90_or_95 or probably even 99
as long as you have enough phospholipids to get to make this a monolayer and they are in great excess it really does n't matter terribly what the composition is'

on july_26,_2000 the district_court denied abbotts motion for a preliminary_injunction
abbott_labs
v. dey l.p. no._00- c-1725 2000 wl 1029198 n.d.ill
july_26,_2000 the` july_26th_order'
while the court concluded that abbott` introduced evidence sufficient to show that the phospholipid in curosurfthe_r performs *1102 substantially the same overall function as the phospholipid in the surface_active_material claimed in the ¡¬ 839 patent and it does so in substantially the same_way to obtain substantially the same overall result as the surface_active_material claimed in the ¡¬839_patent' the court precluded abbott from relying on the doctrine of equivalents
id.at 4-5
the court reasoned as follows because the ¡¬839_patent was issued as an improvement over a prior claimed invention it is not entitled to the broad range of equivalents it might be if it was a pioneer_patent instead ; only a more restricted narrow range of equivalents is available
the plaintiffs made no effort to narrow the range of equivalents available on the phospholipid element ; instead they offered testimony suggesting that a phospholipid_percentage as high as 99.99 % would have functioned in the same_way effectively and improperly reading out the phospholipid_range_limitation altogether
id.at 5 citations omitted
the court also denied the motion for a preliminary_injunction because it believed that a` hypothetical_claim' that literally contained a range of phospholipid up to 94.5 % would not have been allowed over the prior_art ¡¬301_patent
id.at 6-7

abbott appealed the july_26th_order to our court
the parties had fully briefed the appeal and were preparing for a june_7,_2001 oral argument when the district_court granted dey summary_judgment of noninfringement
see abbott_labs
v. dey l.p. no._00 c 1725 2001_wl_558142 n.d.ill
may 21 2001 the` may_21st_order'
we then granted a motion to dismiss abbotts appeal without prejudice to the parties raising the same issues in an appeal of the district_courts summary_judgment of noninfringement

in its opinion granting summary_judgment of noninfringement the district_court concluded that` a competitor would reasonably believe based on the specification and claims of the ¡¬839_patent and the prosecution_history of the ¡¬301_patent that the patentee relinquished the right to exclude any surface_active_material containing among other_things more than 90.7 %_phospholipid based on dry_weight'
id.at 4
with respect to how the claims of the ¡¬839_patent contributed to such an estoppel the district_court reasoned that
the patentee chose to include specific_percentage_ranges for each chemical_component in the surface_active_material and by doing so he created a record that fairly notified the public that he was surrendering the right to exclude material comprised of even the same_components in different_percentages
the plaintiffs can not recapture that surrendered subject_matter through the doctrine of equivalents ; nor can they recapture through the doctrine of equivalents the higher phospholipid_percentage surrendered from the ¡¬301_patent with the issuance of the ¡¬839_patent
id.at 5
regarding the preclusive effect of the specification the district_court stated that
the patentee unequivocally disclosed in the specification of the ¡¬839_patent that the chemical_composition set out in the patent-like the chemical_composition set out in the ¡¬301_patent -was significant and that the changes made in that composition specifically the increase in free_fatty_acids and the necessary corresponding decrease in one or more of the other_components of the material were similarly significant
the plaintiffs should not now be able to argue that those percentage ranges place no limit *1103 on their right to exclude competitors products.. id.at 4-5

with respect to whether the prosecution_history of the ¡¬301_patent contributed to the estoppel the district_court admitted that it had` no authority for the proposition that the prosecution_history of one patent is controlling when analyzing an estoppel claim related to another patent'
id
nevertheless the district_court felt that` at least in this case where the patent-in-suit discloses an improvement of the product and process disclosed in the earlier_patent consideration of the earlier_patents prosecution_history makes good sense'
id

abbott appeals the district_courts summary_judgment of noninfringement of the ¡¬839_patent
the only claims at issue are independent claim 1 and its dependent claims 9_and_12 -15
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
this court reviews a grant of summary_judgment de novo drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party
see e.g. anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)
summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
id.at 247-48 106_s.ct._2505
the various legal limitations on the application of the doctrine of equivalents are to be determined by the court as a matter of law
warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 39_n._8 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997)

abbott argues that the district_courts summary_judgment should be reversed because the district_court improperly precluded abbott from relying on the doctrine of equivalents to prove infringement
according to abbott the district_court 1 impermissibly relied on the prosecution_history of the ¡¬ 301 patent to create an estoppel with respect to the ¡¬839_patent ; 2 performed an erroneous hypothetical_claim_analysis by failing to compare the hypothetical_claim as a whole to the prior_art ; 3 mistakenly interpreted abbotts expert_testimony as` vitiating' the phospholipid claim_limitation ; and 4 improperly limited the claims to their literal_scope because the claims recite numeric_ranges
we address each of these arguments in turn

i
the first step in a prosecution_history_estoppel analysis is to determine which claim_limitations are alleged to be met by equivalents
then the court must determine whether the limitations at issue were amended during prosecution of the patent
if they were not amendment-based estoppel will not bar the application of the doctrine of equivalents
however even if the claim_limitation has not been amended an argument-based estoppel may nevertheless arise based on statements made by the applicant during prosecution
see e.g. elkay mfg co. v. ebco mfg co. 192_f.3d_973 979 52_uspq2d_1109 1113 fed.cir.1999 ; pharmacia & upjohn_co. v. mylan pharms. inc. 170_f.3d_1373 1376-77 50_uspq2d_1033 1036 fed.cir.1999
it is undisputed that the phospholipid_limitation of claim 1 was not amended during prosecution of the ¡¬839_patent ; thus there can be no amendment-based estoppel with respect to this claim_limitation
nor have the parties identified any statements in the ¡¬839 prosecution_history that allegedly give rise to an argument-based estoppel
absent any basis for an estoppel in the prosecution_history of the ¡¬839_patent the district_court relied *1104 instead on the prosecution_history for the ¡¬301_patent

in its discussion of prosecution_history_estoppel the district_court cited pharmacia & upjohn_co. v. mylan pharmaceuticals inc. for the proposition that` [ p ] rosecution history estoppel precludes a patentee from obtaining under the doctrine of equivalents coverage of subject_matter it relinquished-whether by amendment of claims or by arguments made to obtain allowance of claims-during the prosecution of its application'
may_21st_order at 3-4
in pharmacia we also stated that in order to determine what subject_matter an applicant surrenders during prosecution we must ask` whether a competitor would reasonably believe that the applicant had surrendered the relevant subject_matter'
pharmacia 170 f.3d at 1377 50 uspq2d at 1036 quoting cybor corp. v. fas techs. inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1457 46_uspq2d_1169 1175 fed.cir.1998 en banc
pharmacia further noted that` [ w ] e have also stated that the prosecution_history should be objectively viewed from the perspective of one skilled in the art'
id.at n. 21
the district_court concluded that` a competitor would reasonably believe based on the specification and claims of the ¡¬839_patent and the prosecution_history of the ¡¬301_patent that the patentee relinquished the right to exclude any surface_active_material containing among other_things more than 90.7 %_phospholipid based on dry_weight'
may_21st_order at 4 emphasis added

based in part on our opinion in forest_laboratories 239 f.3d at 1314 57 uspq2d at 1800 dey argues that the applicant for the ¡¬839_patent surrendered any scope of equivalents by arguing during prosecution of the ¡¬301_application that` only a surface_active_material having the chemical_composition claimed [ by the ¡¬301_patent ] has the property of rapid_spreading and of ultra-alveolar surface tension reduction'
we disagree that this statement creates an estoppel with respect to the ¡¬839_patent
the statement was merely a characterization of the particular composition claimed by the ¡¬301_patent and how it differed from the known prior_art
the composition of the ¡¬839_patent is a different composition defined by claims that the examiner concluded were patentably distinct from the claims of the ¡¬ 301 patent
in addition given that the statement was made before the ¡¬ 839 patent was even filed it is not unreasonable to conclude that the statement has no applicability to surfactants that might be characterized or discovered in the future

we also believe that the relationship if any between the ¡¬839 and ¡¬301_patent s is insufficient to render particular arguments made during prosecution of the ¡¬301_patent equally applicable to the claims of the ¡¬839_patent as was done by the district_court
see laitram corp. v. cambridge wire cloth co. 863_f.2d_855 862_n._16 9_uspq2d_1289 1296_n._16_(fed.cir.1989) finding no estoppel between two commonly owned patents because the ¡¬949` application was filed more than one year after the ¡¬141_patent issued' ; sextant avionique s.a. v. analog devices inc. 172_f.3d_817 836 49_uspq2d_1865 1878 fed.cir.1999 smith j. dissenting` we have never based a finding of prosecution_history_estoppel on a statement made by a different applicant during prosecution of an unrelated application nor have we ever hinted that competitors should examine the file histories of applications other than the one in suit in order to determine the scope of equivalents that may be accorded the patent
`` ; cf
elkay 192 f.3d at 979 52 uspq2d at 1113 relying on statements made during prosecution of a first patent to construe the claim_language of a second *1105 patent wherein both patents were continuations from a common application and used similar claim_language

it is true that the ¡¬839 and ¡¬301_patent s are commonly owned by abbott and the inventor of the ¡¬839_patent is one of the three inventors of the ¡¬301_patent
however the ¡¬839_application was not filed as a continuation continuation-in-part or divisional application of the ¡¬301_application
these applications have no formal relationship and were presented to the patent office as patentably distinct inventions
see in re berg 140_f.3d_1428 1435_n._7 46_uspq2d_1226 1231_n._7_(fed.cir.1998) noting in the context of considering a double patenting rejection that two applications filed by the same inventor were` not related as by continuation continuation-in-part or divisional' and that filing such two separate applications implied` that each application is independent and patentably distinct'
the invention of the ¡¬839_patent was also based on the continuing studies of dr._tanaka as opposed to the earlier combined efforts of the three inventors of the ¡¬301_application
the specification of the ¡¬839_patent makes clear that dr._tanakas independent and additional research led to the discovery of the improved_surfactant described and claimed by the ¡¬839_patent
see ¡¬839_patent col._1,_ll._35-45
under these circumstances we do not see a basis for concluding that statements made about the characteristics of the surfactant claimed by the ¡¬301_patent should be attributed to the improved_surfactant claimed by the ¡¬839_patent simply because the applications had a common assignee one common_inventor and similar subject_matter
we therefore conclude that the above-quoted statements from the prosecution_history of the ¡¬ 301 patent do not create an estoppel with respect to the ¡¬839_patent

ii
we next consider the district_courts hypothetical_claim_analysis and whether the prior_art limits the scope of equivalents of claim 1 of the ¡¬ 839 patent
the district_court denied abbott any range of equivalents on the basis that the ¡¬839_patent was an` improvement' of the ¡¬301_patent instead of a pioneer_patent
july_26th_order at 5
a pioneer_patent by definition will have little applicable prior_art to limit it whereas an improvement_patents scope is confined by the existing knowledge on which the improvement is based
see e.g. augustine med. inc. v. gaymar indus. inc. 181_f.3d_1291 1301 50_uspq2d_1900 1907 fed.cir.1999` without extensive prior_art to confine and cabin their claims pioneers acquire broader claims than non-pioneers who must craft narrow claims to evade the strictures of a crowded art field`
however the fact that a patent is an improvement_patent does not automatically preclude application of the doctrine of equivalents
`` that a claim describing a limited improvement in a crowded field will have a limited range of permissible equivalents does not negate the availability of the doctrine [ of equivalents ] vel non'
warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 27_n._4 117_s.ct._1040

to determine the scope of the doctrine of equivalents in light of the prior_art a court can consider a` hypothetical_claim' that literally recites the range of equivalents asserted to infringe
`` the pertinent question then becomes whether that hypothetical_claim could have been allowed by the pto over the prior_art'
wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & assocs. 904_f.2d_677 684 14_uspq2d_1942 1948 fed.cir.1990
in this case the hypothetical_claim would be claim 1 of the ¡¬839_patent with the phospholipid_limitation changed to have a range of 68.6 % to 94.5 %
in order for this hypothetical *1106 claim to be anticipated` a single prior_art document [ must ] describe every element of the claimed invention either expressly or inherently such that a person of ordinary_skill in the art could practice the invention without undue experimentation'
advanced display sys. inc. v. kent state univ. 212_f.3d_1272 1282 54_uspq2d_1673 1679 fed.cir.2000 emphasis added
likewise to make the hypothetical_claim obvious the court must find that` the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented [ i.e. the hypothetical_claim ] and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 1994 emphasis added

the district_court erred by comparing only the phospholipid_limitation of claim 1 to the ¡¬301_patent the only prior_art considered by the court while ignoring other limitations of the claim
the ¡¬301_patent describes a phospholipid range of 75.0 % -95.5 % which overlaps the hypothetical_claims range of 68.6 % -94.5 %
the district_court therefore concluded that the asserted range of equivalents was too broad because it encompassed the prior_art
we disagree because the ¡¬301_patent fails to disclose the claim_limitation of free_fatty_acids in the amount of 1.0 % -27.7 %
in fact the ¡¬ 301 patent does not make any reference to a surfactant containing free_fatty_acids although the ¡¬839_patent acknowledges that ta-546` contains less than 1.0 % of free_fatty_acids'
¡¬839_patent col. 1 l.38
it was this discovery that ta-546` can be enhanced by increasing the relative_amount or content of free_fatty_acids' that distinguished the ¡¬839 surfactant from the one described by the ¡¬301_patent
id.at ll.43-44
thus the ¡¬301_patent can not anticipate the hypothetical_claim that literally covers the accused device because the ¡¬301_patent does not disclose each and every limitation of that claim
we also have no basis for concluding that abbotts hypothetical_claim would be obvious over the ¡¬301_patent
on the contrary the addition of free_fatty_acids distinguished the surfactant claimed by the ¡¬ 839 patent from the surfactant described by the ¡¬301_patent
the addition of free_fatty_acids is no less significant with respect to the hypothetical_claim and on this basis an examiner could have determined that the hypothetical_claim was nonobvious
see wilson sporting goods 904 f.2d at 684 14 uspq2d at 1948

a corollary to the district_courts conclusion that abbotts hypothetical_claim would not have been allowed was the idea that increasing the amount of phospholipid
necessarily required a corresponding decrease in one or more of the materials other_components
thus the change in percentages and the ratio among various components must indeed have been significant to the patent examiner and the court has no reason to believe the claim would have been allowed without the alterations made to the percentage ranges of both free_fatty_acid and phospholipid
july_26th_order at p. 7
it is true that if a hypothetical surfactant contained 99.9 %_phospholipid the surfactant could not as a matter of simple math also contain the claimed element of at least 1.0 %_free_fatty_acid
however for a surfactant such as curosurfthe_r having an upper_limit of 94.5 %_phospholipid the surfactant can still contain the remaining elements of the claimed surfactant within their specified ranges including a free_fatty_acid component of at least 1.0 % which is not found in the ¡¬301_patent
thus a hypothetical_claim with an upper_limit of 94.5 %_phospholipid continues to distinguish over the ¡¬301_patent for *1107 the same reason as the originally drafted claim the addition of free_fatty_acids in the claimed range of 1.0 % -27.7 %

as can be seen from a proper application of a hypothetical_claim_analysis wherein the claim as a whole is compared to the prior_art the scope of equivalents asserted by abbott is not so broad as to encompass the prior_art before us
the prior_art does not preclude abbott from relying on the doctrine of equivalents to prove infringement

iii
the doctrine of equivalents` is not a license to ignore or erase structural and functional limitations of the claim'
athletic alternatives inc. v. prince mfg. inc. 73_f.3d_1573 1581 37_uspq2d_1365 1373 fed.cir.1996 quoting perkin-elmer corp. v. westinghouse elec corp. 822_f.2d_1528 1532 3_uspq2d_1321 1324 fed.cir.1987
the district_court believed that abbott` offered testimony suggesting that a phospholipid_percentage as high as 99.99 % would have functioned in the same_way [ as the claimed phospholipid ] effectively and improperly reading out the phospholipid_range_limitation altogether'
july_26th_order at 5

abbotts expert testified however that there is an upper_limit to the acceptable amount of phospholipid in my opinion there is an upper_limit
and we know that because pure lipids when it was a hundred percent did n't work and we tried that in kids.. and it was unsuccessful with pure_phospholipids
we know that pure_phospholipids do n't move very fast..
so somewhere you need enough other material in there to allow the lipid molecules to move fast
and i know that from my own experiments somewhere between51 percent even as low as01 percent in some experiments of the protein would make these phospholipids able to make it to the surface
so a hundred percent would not be right but very close to a hundred percent could still work.. 95 percent would work exactly the same
thus while an exact number can not be stated any more precisely than` less than 100 %' an upper_limit does exist
abbotts expert also testified that 95 %_phospholipid an amount relevant to the curosurfthe_r product accused of infringement would be exactly the same as the claimed phospholipid
although this testimony expands the upper_limit beyond the range literally recited by the claim it does not eliminate the upper_limit altogether
in addition abbott only asserts an upper_limit of 94.5 %
an examination of what happens in the extreme outer ranges of phospholipid_content is therefore irrelevant to the scope of equivalents asserted by abbott

because abbotts application of the doctrine of equivalents to a phospholipid upper_limit of 94.5 % does not eliminate the upper_limit of phospholipid from the claim abbott should not be precluded on this basis from relying on the doctrine of equivalents in this case

iv
as a further basis for precluding abbott from relying on the doctrine of equivalents the district_court reasoned that` the patentee chose to include specific_percentage_ranges for each chemical_component in the surface_active_material and by doing so he created a record that fairly notified the public that he was surrendering the right to exclude material comprised of even the same_components in different_percentages
the plaintiffs can not recapture that surrendered subject_matter through the doctrine of equivalents'
may_21st_order at 5

the fact that a claim recites numeric_ranges does not by itself preclude abbott from relying on the doctrine of *1108 equivalents
for example in jeneric/pentron inc. v. dillon co. 205_f.3d_1377 54_uspq2d_1086_(fed.cir.2000) the claim at issue was for a porcelain composition that recited numeric percentage ranges for each component of the composition
while this court agreed with the jeneric/pentron district_courts claim construction that the claim_language` indicates that the inventions chemical_components should be limited to the precise ranges set forth therein' we also stated that` the district_court will have the opportunity to adjudicate fully the merits of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents'
id.at 1381 1384 54 uspq2d at 1089 1091
thus while the numeric_ranges limited the literal_scope of the claims we did not preclude jeneric/pentron from applying the doctrine of equivalents simply because the claim recited numeric_ranges for the components of the claimed composition
likewise in forest_laboratories we applied the doctrine of equivalents to the water element of claim 1 of the ¡¬839_patent which requires 2.1 % 5.2 % water
see forest labs. 239 f.3d at 1313 57 uspq2d at 1800
we therefore do not find a basis for precluding abbott from relying on the doctrine of equivalents simply because the claim recites numeric_ranges for the components of the claimed surfactant

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we conclude that the district_court erroneously precluded abbott from relying on the doctrine of equivalents to prove infringement by dey
we therefore vacate the district_courts summary_judgment of noninfringement and remand this case for further_proceedings in accordance with this opinion

vacated and remanded
