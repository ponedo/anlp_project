decision
gajarsa circuit_judge
this is an appeal from the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of texas entered on a jury_verdict in a consolidated declaratory_judgment and patent infringement_action relating to u.s._patent_no._5453,863 the` west_patent'
advanced_display_systems inc.` ads' filed a complaint in the northern_district of texas seeking a declaratory_judgment of invalidity of the west_patent
kent_state_university` ksu' an assignee of the west_patent and licensees kent_research_corporation` krc' and kent_display_systems inc.` kds' collectively` kent' then filed an infringement_action and the two cases were consolidated with kent as the nominal defendant and ads as the nominal plaintiff
the parties agreed to have a magistrate_judge preside over the jury_trial
following the two-week trial the jury found that the west_patent was invalid for anticipation and obviousness and not infringed by ads
kent then moved for a new_trial on all the issues in light of newly discovered evidence
kent also moved for a new_trial on anticipation alleging an erroneous jury_instruction
in addition kent filed a motion for sanctions against adss counsel for withholding evidence during discovery
the magistrate_judge denied all of these motions
on appeal we hold that prejudicial_legal_error tainted the jury_instruction we vacate the judgment and remand for a new_trial on anticipation
we also remand for a new_trial on obviousness and infringement in light of the newly discovered evidence
finally we reverse the magistrate_judges ruling on the motion for sanctions

background
since 1965 scientists at ksus liquid crystal institute` lci' have been researching the various properties and applications of liquid_crystal_materials
an important area of research focused on liquid_crystal displays` lcds'
a typical lcd consists of a sandwich of liquid_crystal_material between two glass substrates
an electrical_driver1 connects to the sandwich in order to stimulate or address the liquid_crystal_material thereby creating readable numerical or alphabetical characters
manufacturers of electro-optic products *1276 such as digital watches and notebook computers screens use lcds to display images and information

traditionally lcds were constructed by combining varying concentrations of liquid_crystal_materials and polymers
for example one method for creating lcds involved evaporating water from an aqueous emulsion of liquid_crystal_material in a solution of water-soluble polymer
another method involved phase separation of liquid_crystal from a homogenous solution with a synthetic resin to generate a liquid_crystal phase blended with a polymer phase
those methods however were expensive and entailed complex manufacturing processes
in addition the presence of polymers created a haze effect that obstructed visibility of the displayed information when the lcds were viewed from oblique angles

in early 1992 dr. john west` west' director of lci began experimenting with techniques for developing polymer-free_lcds
west eventually developed a new polymer-free_lcd using cholestric_visible_materials.2 west determined that applying an electric_field pulse of sufficient duration and voltage to cholestric_visible_material creates a contrast between the materials light reflecting and light scattering textures thereby enabling a stable image display
west further found that a stable image could be sustained through a single electric_field pulse rather than continuous application of an electric_field
thus through the unique use of cholestric_visible_materials west achieved the advantages of prior lcds without the drawbacks attendant to the use of polymers

on may_4,_1993 west and his colleague dr. deng-ke yang filed a patent_application covering their polymer-free device and a method for stimulating it
on september 26 1995 the application matured into the west_patent
west then assigned the patent to ksu which through its licensing arm krc subsequently licensed the patent to kds

in february 1992 dr. bao gang wu` wu' a former ksu student and colleague of west formed ads
in june 1993 jiamini gao` gao' adss vice-president of research and development secured a written formula for kents cholestric_lcd
even with knowledge of that formula however ads failed to develop a functional lcd device because it could not construct an effective electrical_driver

in early 1994 dr._zvi_yaniv` yaniv' then president of kds and a former classmate of wu visited ads and demonstrated a prototype of kents cholestric_lcd and its electrical_driver
following the demonstration yaniv went to lunch with wu leaving the prototype at adss offices
seizing the opportunity gao clandestinely removed the prototype from its box and brought it into an ads laboratory
gao then instructed a group of ads engineers including victor zhou` zhou' to disassemble the prototype photograph its various components and re-assemble it in such a manner as to avoid any indication of tampering
throughout this process gao urged his employees to work quickly to avoid detection because he knew the implication of the theft

prior to yanivs visit ads failed to develop an operational polymer-free_lcd through its independent efforts
equipped with the photographs of kents prototype however ads replicated kents cholestric_lcd and electrical_driver within a month
on april_11,_1994 ads also filed a patent_application for a polymer-free_lcd based on the equivalent subject_matter that had been photographed and copied during the surreptitious disassembly of kents prototype
the patent listed wu gao zhou and yao-dong ma as inventors
*1277 while adss application was pending the west_patent issued and the patent and trademark office examiner rejected adss claims directed exclusively to polymer-free_lcds as anticipated by the west_patent
ads consequently amended and limited its claims to cover the application of surface treatment in polymer-free_lcds
the ads application eventually matured into u.s._patent_no._5625,477 on april_29,_1997

in early 1996 kent learned that ads was promoting a polymer-free_lcd and notified ads that it intended to enforce the west_patent
while kent and ads were discussing licensing arrangements ads filed a complaint in the northern_district of texas seeking a declaratory_judgment of invalidity of the west_patent
after settlement negotiations failed kent sued ads for infringement of the west_patent and the cases were consolidated in the northern_district of texas

concurrent with discovery in the present_case ads filed suit in texas state court against usa_display a company with several former_ads_employees alleging trade secret misappropriation
adss attorneys in the usa_display_suit and in the present_case were from the same law firm
during discovery in the usa_display_suit zhous deposition was taken
the pertinent parts of the deposition are set forth below
q can you describe for me or explain to me what exhibit 3 is ?
a this is a picture taken by an employee in ads
i can not remember who took it but i know dr._zvi_yaniv [ and kent ] also develop a similar display they call [ theirs ] bistable display but in ads they call multistable display
but ads did not know how to design the driver for this device
so one day dr._zvi_yaniv visited ads with a sample and [ kent ] have [ a ] completed driver.. and dr._zvi_yaniv gave to jianmi gao who is the vice president of ads and boss of r & d group so he opened dr._zvi_yaniv [s ].. sample and took this picture while at that time dr._zvi_yaniv was not there
so [ yaniv ] did not know

.
.
.
.
.
q what is this picture of ?
a this picture is the picture for the sample brought by zvi_yaniv

.
.
.
.
.
q and [ yaniv ] gave [ the sample to ads ] ?
a [ h ] e not gave a sample he just waited at ads with a sample and- q [ t ] hen he left ?
a no he did not [ leave ] he showed the sample
but during [ t ] his time_period he left and [ gao ] opened the box and took the picture

.
.
.
.
.
q you were there ?
a yeah i was there
q did you open up the driver ?
a yes
i was an employee there
i did whatever my boss told me to do

.
.
.
.
.
q where was mr. zvi_yaniv [ at that time ] ?
a well we are taking picture and i do n't know who he was talking to but he was somewhere within the building or maybe left for lunch..
i just know that [ gao ] want us to take the picture and we took it

.
.
.
.
.
q prior to the meeting in which the kent_state_product was taken apart and photographed at ads.. was ads working on a similar type of display ?
a yeah
they were trying to develop the similar thing
q you said.. that ads was trying to but had not succeeded in making a driver for [ their lcd ] ; is that correct ?
a yes thats correct

.
.
.
.
.
*1278 q would you please describe the difficulties ?
a yeah we did not know how to drive the new display since the driving is another difficult part for design [ ing ] the whole display
we did not know how to drive it what kind of waveform.. we did not know that
q [ was ] exhibit 3 [ helpful ] ?
a right
exhibit 3
this is very big help
so since then we knew we start to know how to design the driver

.
.
.
.
.
q [ b ] efore the photograph was made
how was [ gao ] involved in trying to make the driver ?
a we tried [ for ] a long_time-we tried to understand how to drive it but were not successful
q did [ gao know ? ]
a he had some idea but all not successful
q none of his ideas were ?
a no
we did n't even-

.
.
.
.
.
q [ during ] the time_period before the kent_state_product was taken apart and photographed in the ads lab.. [ was ] ads.. trying to make a driver ?
a right
q and failed
could not do it
a no
they did not have an idea at that time

.
.
.
.
.
q why did ads need a driver for [ its lcd ] ?
a without the driving circuit no one [ is ] interested in that [ lcd ]
that is just a piece of glass
you have to make the life

.
.
.
.
.
q do you know when.. mr._gao brought you the formula for the kent_state cholestric_material ?

.
.
.
.
.
a before june
q before june of what ?
a june93
q before mr._gao gave you the formulation had ads succeeded in making any [ lcd ] cholestric_materials ?
a i did not see it
q after he gave you what he told you to be the kent_state formula were you successful in making cholestric [ lcd ] material ?
a yeah
q you were ?
a after he gave me [ the kent_state_formulation ]
q how long did it take you after he gave you the formulation ?
a few days

.
.
.
.
.
q all right
now after you used the kent_state_formulation to make the [ lcd ] your next problem was the driver ?
a yeah
q and on the day that zvi_yaniv visited ads and brought the [ kent_prototype ] module to show everybody that the photographs were made did zvi_yaniv know the module was being photographed ?
a [ gao ].. told us to be quick
do n't let dr._zvi_yaniv know..

.
.
.
.
.
q so after the photographs were made what happened to the [ kent_prototype ] ?
was it reassembled ?
a reassembled and the [ n ] gave [ it back to yaniv ]
q how long did it take to photograph it ?
a pretty quick
q [ gao ] told you to be quick did n't he ?
a yeah pretty quick

.
.
.
.
.
*1279 q after the kent_state [ prototype ] was copied were you successful in making a driver ?
a yes
after about a month or so
q how did your driver compare to the kent_state driver ?
a we changed the microprocessor but we used the driver
the driver is the key part the most important to this

.
.
.
.
.
q the cholestric_material that was developed at ads was based upon the formulas from kent_state ?
a yes
q and the driver on the [ lcd ] at ads was based upon the driver from kent_state ?
a yeah at that time yes

.
.
.
.
.
q you did n't know whether kent_state or ads owned the technology did you ?
a i know-technically i know the basic [ s ] are the same
q the basic [ s ] of the kent_state- a the chemistry_mixture and the way they make the cell are the same
q as kent_state and ads ?
a right..

.
.
.
.
.
q why did n't [ ads ] just buy the functioning [ driver ].. ?
a [ i ] t is not market available i think
we can not buy it

.
.
.
.
.
q is it true that there are hundreds of shelf drivers ?
a thousands and thousands
q and so theoretically you could begin today to test and test drivers for years and not other than by accident hit the right driver ?
a by luck you may get it in a second
if not luck it takes 10 years it takes your life
q so in order to find one that [ properly charged the lcd ] you either do random experimentation to find a shelf driver or invent or create a new driver ?
a yeah
q or use somebody elses driver ?
a right

.
.
.
.
.
q [ n ] one of [ the drivers ] was built before ads got this photograph ?
a right
q so the entire system that makes this was still to be done ?
a right
q and was anybody working on designing this system ?
a [ w ] e did not know how to design.. we do n't know

.
.
.
.
.
q [ dr. wu ] told you to change things around so that he could get out-away from an earlier patent ?
a he tried to find us a new_way to build another kind of [ polymer-free_lcd ] so we can avoid a conflict with kent_state yes

.
.
.
.
.
q why did n't you find a new_way ?
a it is very hard.. we did not have the time we did not have the money to test everything

during this testimony adss attorney attempted to terminate the deposition and telephoned the presiding judge to request a protective_order
the judge denied adss request but suggested that both parties keep the deposition confidential until ads filed a formal motion for a protective_order
ads however never filed the motion and eventually abandoned the suit
adss attorney also instructed the court_reporter not to prepare a transcript of the deposition

during discovery in the present_case ads failed to disclose to kent the events that took place during yanivs lunch with wu in spite of various demands made upon *1280 ads
in particular kent served upon ads a document_request for` [ a ] ll documents that refer or relate to any evaluation analysis examination testing performance or investigation of any light-modulating reflective_device comprising [ cholestric_material ] or any compound thereof made by kds the [ lci ] or any third_party'
adss attorneys however failed to notify kent about zhous identity or the deposition in the usa_display_suit
adss attorneys also failed to produce the photograph of kents prototype instead characterizing it as` attorney work product' in the privilege log.3

at the end of discovery all pre-trial issues regarding claim construction validity and infringement were submitted to a special_master who construed the claims and recommended a denial of adss motion for summary judgment on the issue of anticipation
the magistrate_judge then adopted the special_masters report and this case proceeded to a jury_trial

at trial both parties presented evidence and expert testimony concerning anticipation obviousness and infringement
on the issue of anticipation in particular ads argued that the west_patent was anticipated by u.s. patent no._4097,127 the` haas_patent' and the documents incorporated by reference therein
the documents incorporated into the haas_patent disclosed hundreds of different liquid_crystal_materials that could reflect visible and infrared light
from that body of materials ads contended with perfect hindsight that the combination of the haas_patent and three particular liquid_crystal_materials taught every element of the west_patent

into the first week of trial kent was advised by mr._kan_xu a former_ads_employee and president of usa_display that zhou possessed information relevant to the case
then more than one week into trial and without an opportunity to probe zhous knowledge kent called zhou to testify about how ads disassembled kents prototype and photographed it
the photograph was also finally provided to kent and admitted into evidence
at this stage however kent still did not possess a copy of zhous deposition_transcript from the usa_display_suit

at the close of evidence kents attorney did not make a motion for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' on either the validity or infringement issues
on the issue of anticipation the magistrate_judge instructed the jury that their role was to determine whether and to what extent_material from other_documents was incorporated by reference into the haas_patent
kents attorney objected to this instruction but the magistrate_judge overruled the objection and included the instruction in his final charge to the jury
the magistrate_judge also provided the following definition of incorporation by reference [ t ] he purpose of incorporation by reference is to make one document become part of another document by referring to the form in the latter in such a manner that it is apparent that the cited document is part of the referencing document as if it were fully set out therein

after initial_deliberations the jury was unable to resolve the issues of anticipation and obviousness
the magistrate_judge however instructed the jurors to continue deliberating until they reached a verdict
two hours later the jury determined that the west_patent was invalid for anticipation and obviousness and not infringed

following the jury_verdict kents attorney again failed to make a motion for jmol
rather having finally received zhous deposition_transcript kent filed a motion for a new_trial based on 1 newly discovered evidence in view of the deposition and 2 adss withholding of relevant_evidence during discovery
kds also filed a motion seeking the imposition of sanctions *1281 against ads and its attorneys for improper conduct during discovery
regarding kents motion for a new_trial the magistrate_judge found that zhous deposition was merely cumulative of his testimony at trial
the magistrate_judge also determined that kent was not prejudiced by the late disclosure of the photograph and the evidence relating to adss disassembly of kents prototype because kent was able to present that evidence to the jury
as for sanctions the magistrate_judge denied kdss motion but remarked that he was` deeply concerned' with the conduct of adss attorneys and indicated that he would consider further disciplinary action

anticipation
anticipation is a question of fact see in re graves 69_f.3d_1147 1151 36_uspq2d_1697 1700 fed.cir.1995 that this court reviews for substantial evidence on appeal from a jury_trial see baxter int l inc. v. mcgaw inc. 149_f.3d_1321 1332 47_uspq2d_1225 1233 fed.cir.1998
however a partys failure to make a motion for jmol see fed.r.civ.p
50 b at any phase of the litigation precludes an appellate court from reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the jury_verdict
see biodex corp. v. loredan biomedical inc. 946_f.2d_850 862 20_uspq2d_1252 1261 fed.cir.1991 holding that failure to make a post-verdict jmol forecloses appellate review of the jurys factfinding ; jurgens v. mckasy 927_f.2d_1552 1557 18_uspq2d_1031 1035 fed.cir.1991 requiring a party to make a motion for directed verdict in order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal ; see also 9a charles alan wright & arthur r. miller federal practice & procedure ¡± 2536 2d ed.1994 explaining that the rationale for the rule is that a partys failure to make a motion for jmol works as a concession that sufficient evidence exists for a jury to reach a verdict
in the present_case because kent did not make a motion for jmol at the close of evidence or following the jury_verdict we will not disturb the jurys factual determinations

notwithstanding the absence of a motion for jmol a party may still challenge a jury_verdict by establishing that the judge committed legal_error or abused his discretion
see biodex 946 f.2d at 854 20 uspq2d at 1255 stating that jury_verdict may be altered if the instructions` were incorrect or incomplete as given' ; jurgens 927 f.2d at 1557-58 18 uspq2d at 1036 providing that despite the absence of a jmol motion party could challenge judgment based on jury_instructions
on appeal kent contends that the magistrate_judge committed legal_error by instructing the jury to determine what material was incorporated by reference into the haas_patent for purposes of anticipation.4 a party seeking to alter a judgment based on erroneous jury_instructions must establish that 1 it made a proper and timely objection to the jury_instructions 2 those instructions were legally erroneous see biodex 946 f.2d at 853-54 20 uspq2d at 1254-55 3 the errors had prejudicial effect see jamesbury corp. v. litton indus
prod. inc. 756_f.2d_1556 1558 225_uspq_253 255 fed.cir.1985 and 4 it requested alternative instructions that would have remedied the error
see delta-x corp. v. baker hughes prod
tools inc. 984_f.2d_410 415 25_uspq2d_1447 1450-51 fed.cir.1993

pursuant to rule 51 of the federal_rules of civil_procedure a party must object to jury_instructions` before the jury retires to consider its verdict stating distinctly the matter objected to and the *1282 grounds for objection'
fed.r.civ.p
51
because objection to a jury_instruction involves a procedural matter that is not intimately related to this courts exclusive jurisdiction we look to the regional circuit law to ascertain the requirements necessary to comply with the rule
see lummus indus. inc. v. d.m
& e. corp. 862_f.2d_267 270 8_uspq2d_1983 1985 fed.cir.1988 applying fourth circuit law to determine whether a party timely objected to a jury_instruction
according to fifth_circuit_law a party satisfies rule 51 by objecting to an instruction prior to the jurys deliberation and stating the reason for its objection
see a.b
baumstimler v. rankin 677_f.2d_1061 1069 215_uspq_575 581-82 5th cir.1982
here kent objected before the magistrate_judge charged the jury and explained that the instruction was erroneous because the jury should not decide what material was incorporated by reference
kents objection therefore complied with fifth_circuit_law

whether a jury_instruction is legally erroneous is a question of law
see brooktree corp. v. advanced micro devices inc. 977_f.2d_1555 1570 24_uspq2d_1401 1411 fed.cir.1992
when reviewing an instruction for legal_error this court reads the instructions as a whole and considers them in light of the entire charge to the jury
see united states surgical corp. v. ethicon inc. 103_f.3d_1554 1564 41_uspq2d_1225 1232 fed.cir.1997` jury instructions are reviewed for correctness with due attention to their clarity objectivity and adequacy taken as a whole
`` ; biodex 946 f.2d at 854 20 uspq2d at 1255 noting that this court reviews jury_instructions in their entirety
here the relevant inquiry is whether the magistrate_judge committed legal_error in his jury_instruction on anticipation

section 102 b provides that` a person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was patented or described in a printed publication.. more than one year prior to the date of the application'
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b 1994
accordingly invalidity by anticipation requires that the four corners of a single prior_art_document describe every element of the claimed invention either expressly or inherently such that a person of ordinary_skill in the art could practice the invention without undue experimentation
see atlas powder co. v. ireco inc. 190_f.3d_1342 1347 51_uspq2d_1943 1947 fed.cir.1999 ; in re paulsen 30_f.3d_1475 1479 31_uspq2d_1671 1673 fed.cir.1994
material not explicitly contained in the single prior_art_document may still be considered for purposes of anticipation if that material is incorporated by reference into the document
see ultradent prods. inc. v. life-like cosmetics inc. 127_f.3d_1065 1069 44_uspq2d_1336 1339-40 fed.cir.1997 holding that material incorporated by reference into a document may be considered in an anticipation_determination
incorporation by reference provides a method for integrating material from various_documents into a host_document-a patent or printed publication in an anticipation_determination-by citing such material in a manner that makes clear that the material is effectively part of the host_document as if it were explicitly contained therein
see general elec co. v. brenner 407_f.2d_1258 1261-62 159_uspq_335 337 d.c.cir.1968 ; in re lund 54_c.c.p.a._1361 376_f.2d_982 989 153_uspq_625 631 ccpa 1967
to incorporate material by reference the host_document must identify with detailed particularity what specific material it incorporates and clearly indicate where that material is found in the various_documents
see in re seversky 474_f.2d_671 674 177_uspq_144 146 ccpa 1973 providing that incorporation by reference requires a statement` clearly identifying the subject_matter which is incorporated and where it is to be found' ; in re saunders 58_c.c.p.a._1316 444_f.2d_599 602-03 170_uspq_213 216-17 ccpa 1971 reasoning that a rejection for anticipation is appropriate only if one reference` expressly incorporates a particular part' of another reference ; national latex *1283 prods co. v. sun rubber co. 274_f.2d_224 230 123_uspq_279 283 6th cir.1959 requiring a specific reference to material in an earlier application in order have that material considered part of a later application ; cf
lund 376 f.2d at 989 153 uspq at 631 holding that a one sentence reference to an abandoned application is not sufficient to incorporate material from the abandoned application into a new application

whether and to what extent_material has been incorporated by reference into a host_document is a question of law
see quaker city gear works inc. v. skil corp. 747_f.2d_1446 1453-54 223_uspq_1161 1166 fed.cir.1984 reasoning that whether a document is incorporated by reference into a patent presents a question of law when determining enablement
as the court observed in general electric the doctrine of incorporation by reference has its roots in the law of wills and contracts
407 f.2d at 1260 159 uspq at 337
in those areas of jurisprudence whether material is incorporated by reference presents a question of law
see 11 richard a. lord williston on contracts ¡± 30:25 4th ed.1999 observing that terms of a contract may be expressed in separate documents and the determination of which terms are incorporated into the contract is a question of law ; george taylor bogert the law of trusts and trustees ¡± 105 2d ed
rev.1984 describing the use of incorporation by reference to supply additional terms to a will and providing cases holding that whether terms are incorporated into a will is a question of law ; see also topro servs. inc. v. mccarthy w
constr. inc. 827_f.supp._666 667 d.colo.1993` whether the prime contract or any part of it was incorporated by reference into the subcontract is a question of law
`` ; siler v. dorsett 108_n.c._300 302 12_s.e._986 987 n.c.1891 holding that court decides whether a will incorporated material from other_documents
logic therefore requires that incorporation by reference in the field of patent law is also a question of law
further the standard of one reasonably skilled in the art should be used to determine whether the host_document describes the material to be incorporated by reference with sufficient particularity

moreover no necessary contradiction exists given that incorporation by reference is a question of law while anticipation is a question of fact
anticipation put simply requires that every element of the claimed invention was previously` described in a single_reference'
scripps clinic & research found
v. genentech inc. 927_f.2d_1565 1576 fed.cir.1991 emphasis added
thus if incorporation by reference comes into play in an anticipation_determination the courts role is to determine what material in addition to the host_document constitutes the single_reference
the factfinders role in turn is to determine whether that single_reference describes the claimed invention

turning now to the present_case ads argued at trial that the west_patent was anticipated by the haas_patent and the material incorporated therein from other_documents
the magistrate_judge charged the jury with the task of determining what material was incorporated by reference
as explained above it was the duty of the magistrate_judge to determine as a matter of law whether and what material was incorporated by reference into the haas_patent
thus we conclude that instructing the jury to make that determination constituted legal_error

we next consider whether that error was prejudicial
prejudicial legal_error exists when it` appears to the court [ that the error is ] inconsistent with substantial justice'
fed.r.civ.p
61
in the present_case determining what material was incorporated by reference into the haas_patent was a critical question of law for the magistrate_judge to resolve before submitting the factual issue of anticipation to the jury
indeed during trial ads never contended that the material explicitly set forth in the haas_patent alone would anticipate the *1284 west_patent
rather adss anticipation argument hinged on the combination of the haas_patent and the material potentially incorporated therein
the magistrate_judge however failed to address the legal question ; instead he left that determination for the jury
this misallocation of responsibility goes to the core of an anticipation_determination when if incorporation by reference is at issue the court must determine what material constitutes the single prior_art_document
consequently because the instruction vitiated kents right to have a pivotal legal question resolved by the court we hold that the legal_error was prejudicial

we further hold that kents objection would have cured the defect
in the present_case the proper jury_instruction on incorporation by reference would have been no instruction at all
thus kents request that the question of incorporation by reference not be submitted to the jury would have ameliorated the error

accordingly given that kent preserved its right to appeal the jury_instruction and prejudicial_legal_error infected that instruction we remand for a new_trial on anticipation

obviousness
because kent failed to make a motion for jmol at any time during trial we can not weigh the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the jurys factual findings on obviousness
see biodex 946 f.2d at 862 20 uspq2d at 1261
kent however preserved its right to seek relief from the verdict by making a motion for a new_trial which the magistrate_judge denied
see new idea farm equip corp. v. sperry corp. 916_f.2d_1561 1565-66 16_uspq2d_1424 1428 fed.cir.1990 providing that as an alternative to a post-verdict motion court may grant motion for a new_trial if prejudicial error occurred
this court reviews a denial of a motion for a new_trial under the abuse of discretion standard
see motorola inc. v. interdigital tech corp. 121_f.3d_1461 1468 43_uspq2d_1481 1486 fed.cir.1997
to that end we must determine whether in the conduct of the trial an error occurred that was so egregious as to render the trial unfair
see dmi inc. v. deere & co. 802_f.2d_421 427 231_uspq_276 280 fed.cir.1986

rule 59 a of the federal_rules of civil_procedure provides that a` new_trial may be granted to.. any of the parties.. in an action in which there has been a trial by a jury for any of the reasons for which new_trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in courts of the united states'
fed.r.civ.p
59 a ; see blue diamond co. v. charles m. allen & son inc. 56_f.2d_1 3 5th cir.1932 recognizing that newly discovered evidence can give rise to a right to a new_trial
kent contends that it is entitled to a new_trial due to newly discovered evidence-namely the zhou_deposition
determining whether the newly discovered evidence warrants a new_trial entails the following three-prong analysis 1 the probability that the evidence would have changed the outcome of the trial ; 2 whether the evidence could have been discovered earlier through the moving partys due_diligence ; and 3 whether the evidence is merely cumulative or impeaching
see farm credit bank v. guidry 110_f.3d_1147 1155 5th cir.1997 ; diaz v. methodist hosp. 46_f.3d_492 495 5th_cir.1995

this court measures whether the newly discovered evidence is potentially outcome determinative by reference to our obviousness jurisprudence
a claimed invention is invalid for obviousness if the differences between it and the prior_art` are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 1994 ; see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 13-14 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
obviousness is ultimately a question of law that rests on *1285 underlying factual inquiries including 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 objective_considerations of nonobviousness
see graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684 ; robotic vision sys. inc. v. view eng g inc. 189_f.3d_1370 1376 51_uspq2d_1948 1953 fed.cir.1999
objective considerations such as failure by others to solve the problem and copying see graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684` may often be the most probative and cogent evidence' of nonobviousness
stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538 218_uspq_871 879 fed.cir.1983

in the present_case zhous deposition furnishes persuasive evidence that the west_patent is nonobvious by describing adss repeated failures to design the claimed invention
in his deposition zhou testified that ads was entirely unsuccessful in developing the cholestric_visible_material through independent research
zhou also explained that ads` tried for a long_time' to build an electrical_driver but its efforts` were all not successful'
zhou further detailed how adss attempts to develop a polymer-free_lcd met with failure and that ads` did not know how to design' the device until it copied the claimed invention
in addition zhou testified that even after gaining access to the claimed invention ads was unable to design around the west_patent because such a task was time consuming and` very hard'

our case law supports kents view that such_evidence of failed attempts by others could be determinative on the issue of obviousness
for example in alco standard corp. v. tennessee valley authority this court held that when evidence in the record fully supports a finding that others in the industry failed to solve the problem then objective_considerations` may.. establish that an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior_art was not'
808_f.2d_1490 1500-01 1_uspq2d_1337 1344-45 fed.cir.1986
similarly in intel corp. v. united states international trade commission we reasoned that an accused infringers inability to develop a product made possible by the claimed invention indicated nonobviousness
946_f.2d_821 835 20_uspq2d_1161 1173 fed.cir.1991 ; see also minnesota mining & mfg co. v. johnson & johnson orthopaedics inc. 976_f.2d_1559 1574 24_uspq2d_1321 1333-34 fed.cir.1992 reasoning that competitors failure to develop the patented invention suggested nonobviousness ; panduit_corp. v. dennison_mfg co. 774_f.2d_1082 1099 227_uspq_337 349 fed.cir.1985 reasoning that failure by others including the accused infringer to develop the claimed invention constitutes` virtually irrefutable' evidence of nonobviousness vacated dennison_mfg co. v. panduit_corp. 475_u.s._809 106_s.ct._1578 89_l.ed.2d_817_(1986) vacating for failure to give proper deference to district_courts fact finding rather than legal_error

zhous deposition also provides compelling_evidence of nonobviousness by illustrating adss wholesale copying of the claimed invention
see specialty composites v. cabot corp. 845_f.2d_981 991 6_uspq2d_1601 1608 fed.cir.1988 reasoning that an accused infringers close copying of the` claimed invention rather than one in the public domain is indicative of nonobviousness'
indeed zhous deposition reveals that adss device was virtually an identical replica of the claimed invention
zhou testified that the kent and ads` chemistry_mixture [ s ] and the way [ s ] they make the cell are the same'
underlying that comparison was zhous testimony that ads developed its cholestric_visible_material by copying kents formula
zhou also explained that ads built its electrical_driver by disassembling kents prototype photographing its features and then using the photograph essentially as an instruction manual
the import of such copying evidence merits even greater weight in view of adss failure *1286 to develop independently the claimed invention
see dow chem co. v. american cyanamid co. 816_f.2d_617 622 2_uspq2d_1350 1355 fed.cir.1987 reasoning that an infringers failed attempts to develop the claimed invention followed by subsequent copying of the invention supports a holding of nonobviousness ; vandenberg v. dairy equip co. 740_f.2d_1560 1567 224_uspq_195 199 fed.cir.1984` the copying of an invention may constitute evidence that the invention is not an obvious one..
this would be particularly true where the copyist had itself attempted for a substantial length of time to design a similar device and had failed
``

furthermore with respect to both objective_considerations zhous deposition_testimony constitutes highly probative evidence of nonobviousness given that after initial_deliberations the jury was in equipoise on the issue of obviousness and this newly discovered evidence could have been the tipping factor for finding the west_patent to be not invalid
thus we find that the constellation of facts contained in the zhou_deposition presents evidence that is potentially outcome determinative on the issue of obviousness

we also hold that kent exercised due_diligence throughout the discovery_process but it was powerless to unearth the zhou_deposition because ads deliberately and intentionally withheld the deposition and the photograph of kents prototype
in its first document_request kent required` all documents that refer or relate to any evaluation analysis examination testing performance or investigation of any light-modulating reflective_device comprising [ cholestric_material ] or any compound thereof made by kds the [ lci ] or any third_party'
in its interrogatories kent asked ads to
[ i ] dentify each communication that ads or its present or former.. employees.. has participated in or has knowledge of that refers or relates to [ kent ] or products being developed under research under investigation made sold or offered for sale by [ kent ] or to any claims asserted by any party in this lawsuit or to any allegations that ads has made against or about [ kent ]
with reference to each communication provide.. the identity of all documents referring or relating to the communication.. any fair reading of the document_request and interrogatory coupled with adss duty to supplement its disclosures and responses under rule 26 e of the federal_rules of civil_procedure required ads to disclose the existence of the zhou_deposition and to produce the photograph of kents prototype

ads however effectively concealed both pieces of evidence
with regard to the deposition adss counsel instructed the court_reporter not to prepare a transcript and then quickly abandoned the state court suit thereby suppressing the existence of zhous deposition_testimony
as for the photograph which was initially produced at the deposition ads characterized it as` attorney_work_product'
as a result by preventing kent from examining the photograph and inquiring about how ads came to possess it ads completely sealed off kent from discovering the existence of the zhou_deposition much less its substance

in fact the sole reason that kent was able to discover that zhou possessed crucial information was through its continued diligence
midway through trial kent served a trial subpoena on mr._kan_xu a former_ads_employee who then advised kent that zhou would be a useful witness to their case
thus half-way through trial and by virtue of its own effort kent became aware of information that adss counsel was obligated to disclose months earlier during the normal course of discovery
kent however still could not ascertain the full scope of zhous knowledge because it did not receive the deposition_transcript until after the jury retired to deliberate

*1287 we further hold that zhous deposition_testimony is not merely cumulative or impeaching
rather zhous deposition contained a significant amount of material_evidence that ads prevented kent from presenting at trial
for example the jury did not hear zhous deposition_testimony about how ads obtained kents cholestric formula used that formula to duplicate kents cholestric_material and then used that material in its own_device ; nor did the jury hear zhous admission that adss electrical_driver was essentially the same as kents
the jury also did not hear zhous statements concerning the extent of adss failure to develop its own_device or the detailed copying of kents prototype
furthermore the jury did not hear about adss failure to design around the claimed invention even after it disassembled and studied kents prototype

moreover to the extent that some overlap exists between the zhou_deposition_testimony and his trial testimony we do not find it sufficient to preclude a new_trial
to find otherwise would be to prejudice the party who acts diligently and complies with the federal_rules of civil_procedure and to benefit the party who contravenes those rules and uses dilatory discovery tactics
indeed one can readily imagine a situation in which counsel conceals material_evidence throughout discovery and then reveals that evidence late into the trial thereby depriving the other party of a fair_trial in the first instance as well as foreclosing the opportunity for a new_trial
such a result would be manifestly unjust

thus in light of the newly discovered evidence we remand for a new_trial on the issue of obviousness

infringement
as with obviousness kents only viable argument to alter the non-infringement verdict is through a motion for a new_trial
because the analysis for the last two prongs of the test for a motion for a new_trial is the same for obviousness and infringement we limit our discussion to the first prong-whether the newly discovered evidence is potentially outcome determinative on the issue of infringement

to establish infringement a party must show that the accused device contains either literally or by equivalents every limitation of the claimed invention
see applied materials inc. v. advanced semiconductor materials am. inc. 98_f.3d_1563 1574 40_uspq2d_1481 1489 fed.cir.1996 ; pennwalt corp. v. durand-wayland inc. 833_f.2d_931 934-35 4_uspq2d_1737 1739-40 fed.cir.1987 en banc
during the deposition zhou testified that the design of adss device was directly` based upon' kents cholestric_material formula and its electrical_driver_circuitry
zhou also explained that the kents and adss` chemistry_mixture [ s ] and the way they make the cell are the same'
zhou further testified that ads failed to design a device that was different from the claimed invention

although not itself evidence of infringement zhous deposition is compelling_evidence relating to infringement
zhou was one of the engineers who worked on adss device and possessed an intimate understanding of the similarities between adss device and the claimed invention
zhous deposition directly addresses how adss electrical_driver_circuitry was designed and implemented
that circuitry provides a waveform to change portions of the liquid_crystal
the way in which adss device causes the liquid_crystal to switch is material to the question of literal infringement because the west_patent covers a particular method for stimulating the liquid_crystal
in addition the evidence of copying present in zhous deposition supports a claim of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
see graver tank & mfg co. v. linde air prods co. 339_u.s._605 612 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097_(1950) ; roton barrier inc. v. stanley works 79_f.3d_1112 1126 37_uspq2d_1816 1827 fed.cir.1996

*1288 furthermore the impact of zhous deposition on the issue of infringement is not limited solely to the content of the deposition ; rather this evidence has ramifications that would have greatly changed the complexion of kents trial strategy
if kent possessed this evidence before trial it could have chosen to depose more witnesses-most notably zhou pursued different avenues of discovery sought additional corroborating evidence implemented different tactics during cross-examination and so forth
in short armed with the zhou_deposition at an early stage in discovery kent could have developed a different theory of the case and presented a more persuasive story at trial

accordingly based on the newly discovered evidence we remand for a new_trial on infringement

sanctions
following the jury_verdict kent made a motion for sanctions against adss counsel seeking sanctions in the form of new_trial given adss suppression of the zhou_deposition and the photograph of kents prototype
the magistrate_judge denied the motion but indicated that he was` deeply concerned' by the conduct of adss counsel
the magistrate_judge also indicated that he would seriously consider taking disciplinary action under the local rules and imposing appropriate sanctions other than granting a new_trial

when reviewing a district_courts decision on the propriety of imposing sanctions for misconduct during discovery we apply the regional circuits law
see seal-flex inc. v. athletic track & court constr. 172_f.3d_836 845 50_uspq2d_1225 1231 fed.cir.1999
the fifth circuit reviews a denial of sanctions for an abuse of discretion
see tacon mechanical contractors inc. v. aetna cas
& sur co. 65_f.3d_486 489 5th_cir.1995
although a district_court possesses inherent power to sanction an attorneys bad_faith_conduct during litigation see chambers v. nasco inc. 501_u.s._32 43-46 111_s.ct._2123 115_l.ed.2d_27_(1991) the threshold for the imposition of such sanctions is high see chaves v. m/v medina star 47_f.3d_153 156 5th_cir.1995
thus the district_court must make a specific finding of bad_faith_conduct in order to impose sanctions
see id

from the record below it appears to this court that adss development of its lcd_technology consisted of deceitful and conniving machinations that amounted to nothing short of corporate espionage of a competitors valuable technology
regretfully the conduct of adss counsel in defending such actions was equally egregious
indeed to say that counsels conduct during discovery raises the collective eyebrow of this court would be to understate the severity of their transgressions

counsels tactics during discovery evinced a brazen disregard for the legal process
throughout discovery counsels strategy consisted of efforts to obfuscate cover-up and subvert evidence that was properly discoverable and responsive to kents requests
for example when confronted with the bleak realization that zhous deposition would reveal damaging information adss counsel attempted to terminate the deposition
counsel next tried to eliminate any trace of the deposition by instructing the court_reporter not to make a transcript
counsel then failed to disclose the depositions existence during the discovery stage of the action
counsel further failed to list zhou as a person having knowledge of the development of adss lcd_technology even though he was an engineer at ads working on the project during those years

moreover in what may be its most egregious discovery ploy counsel characterized the photograph of kents prototype as` attorney-work product' even though the photograph was taken by an ads employee years before the present litigation ensued
when asked about the justification for listing the photograph on the privilege *1289 log adss counsel responded that the original_photograph was photocopied by an attorney
this court however is unable to find any legal principle that even remotely supports the notion that an otherwise discoverable document alchemically metamorphisizes into privileged work product simply because an attorney photocopies it

thus we conclude that the suppression of the zhou_deposition and the concealment of the photograph through a spurious privilege claim coupled with the central role that such_evidence would have played at this trial amounts to bad_faith_conduct on the part of adss counsel
in a case such as this in which counsel deliberately and repeatedly flouts discovery requests and disregards the federal_rules of civil_procedure the sanction of a new_trial fits the transgression
indeed the acts of adss counsel strike at the heart of the discovery_process and they deprived kent of its full measure of a right to a fair_trial based upon all the relevant_evidence
accordingly we reverse the magistrate_judges denial of a motion for sanctions by granting a new_trial
furthermore we strongly encourage the magistrate_judge to follow through on his desire to review very carefully the conduct of adss counsel and to consider within his discretion imposing disciplinary actions and additional sanctions beyond the granting of a new_trial

conclusion
based upon the discussion above we vacate the judgment and remand for a new_trial on the issue of anticipation because the magistrate_judges jury_instruction contained prejudicial_legal_error
we also remand for a new_trial on the issues of obviousness and infringement because of the newly discovered evidence
in addition we also reverse the magistrate_judges ruling on sanctions by the grant of a new_trial

reversed-in part vacated-in-part and remanded
