tyco_healthcare_group_lp and mallinckrodt inc. collectively` tyco' appeal from a summary_judgment invalidating the two claims of u.s. patent no._5211,954` the ¡¬954_patent` for obviousness
we affirm

i. temazepam is a hypnotic sleep-inducing drug that is one of a class of compounds known as benzodiazepines
pharmacological formulations of temazepam have been marketed internationally for the treatment of insomnia since the 1970s and in the united_states since 1981 under the name restorilthe_r
tyco holds the rights to the ¡¬954_patent which has two claims for temazepam formulations
claim 1 reads a hard gelatin capsule containing a temazepam formulation consisting essentially of 6_to_8 milligrams of crystalline_temazepam having a surface_area of from 0.big_token__65_to_1__big_tokenbig_token__1_m_2__big_token /g and 95 % of the temazepam having a particle size of less than 65 microns in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor
claim 2 is identical except that it recites a composition containing 7.5 milligrams of crystalline_temazepam
the ¡¬954_patent issued in may 1993 with a priority_date of september 1986
tycos predecessor-in-interest began marketing restorilthe_r in 7.5 mg_dosages in 1991

in november 2006 mutual pharmaceutical company inc. filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' with the u.s. food and drug administration` fda' seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of 7.5 mg_temazepam_capsules
tyco responded in march 2007 by filing an infringement action against mutual and united_research_laboratories inc. collectively` mutual'
in july 2009 after mutual had received tentative fda approval of its anda tyco moved for a preliminarily injunction to prevent mutual from selling its generic temazepam capsule
the district_court denied tycos motion based on uncontroverted evidence that mutuals anda disclosed a product that could not literally infringe the ¡¬954_patent because the anda required the surface_area of the crystalline_temazepam to be at least 2.2 square meters per gram
see bayer ag v. elan pharm
research corp. 212_f.3d_1241 1249 fed.cir.2000

mutual then moved for summary_judgment of noninfringement and invalidity
the district_court granted mutuals motion with respect to invalidity concluding that mutual had shown by clear and convincing evidence that the ¡¬954_claims were obvious and that no reasonable trier of fact could find to the contrary
in reaching that conclusion the court noted first that restorilthe_r capsules had been sold in the united_states in 15 mg and 30 mg_dosages more than a year before the priority_date of the ¡¬954_patent
second the court looked to a 1983 volume of the british national formulary` bnf' a medical_reference_book published in the united kingdom which directed physicians to the use of temazepam at a dosage between 5_and_15 mg for the treatment of insomnia in the elderly
third the court observed that the parties did not dispute that` physicians always seek to prescribe the lowest_effective_dose of any medication particularly hypnotics such as temazepam'
based on those undisputed facts the court concluded that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art to combine the preexisting 15 mg restorilthe_r capsule with the dosage_range identified in the bnf_reference
tyco appeals the district_courts order invalidating the ¡¬954_claims

*1372 ii
the only physical feature distinguishing the ¡¬954_claims from the restorilthe_r 15 mg_capsules is the amount of temazepam contained in the capsule
in 1987 tycos predecessor-in-interest filed a supplemental new drug application with the fda for manufacture and sale of 7.5 mg_temazepam_capsules within the scope of both ¡¬954_claims
the application stated that [ t ] he formulation and manufacture of restorilthe_r capsules 7.5 mg are similar to that used for the 15_and_30 milligram capsules..
the formulation differs only in the reduction of the dose..
the capsule manufacturing method is exactly the same as has been described for the currently marketed doses
given that uncontested description the only limitation of the two ¡¬954_claims that was not fully disclosed by the prior_art restorilthe_r capsules is the lower_dosage of temazepam

the bnf is a medical_reference_book published semiannually by the british medical association and the pharmaceutical society of great_britain
the preface to the bnf explains that it serves as` a pocket book for rapid reference.. for prescribing and dispensing' drugs and that its entries` are intended to help in the choice of appropriate treatment of each patient'
the 1983 bnf_entry for` temazepam' reads as follows indications insomnia useful in the elderly cautions ; side-effects see under nitrazepam,1 but except at high dosage hangover is uncommon and doses less cumulative
less appropriate in patients with early wakening

dose 10-30 mg elderly_patients 5-15 mg increasing in severe insomnia to 60 mg 30 minutes before bedtime
bnf at 127 emphasis added
the district_court concluded that` [ t ] his entry plainly tells one of skill in the art to treat insomnia in the elderly by administering a dose in the range of 5_to_15 mg.' 2 the court noted that a physician would be motivated to prescribe a temazepam dosage lower than 15 mg because of the preference for the lowest_effective_dose particularly in the case of elderly_patients sensitive to the side_effects of hypnotic medications
ordinarily` where there is a range disclosed in the prior_art and the claimed invention falls within that range there is a presumption of obviousness'
*1373 iron grip barbell co. v. usa sports inc. 392_f.3d_1317 1322 fed.cir.2004 ; accord lazare kaplan int l inc. v. photoscribe techs. inc. 628_f.3d_1359 1380-81 fed.cir.2010
that presumption is rebuttable either by a showing that the prior_art taught away from the invention or by a showing of new and unexpected_results relative to the prior_art
iron grip barbell 392 f.3d at 1322
tyco argues first that the bnf_reference does not direct a person of ordinary_skill in the art to temazepam hard_capsules in the 5_to_15 mg dosage_range
it then argues that the prior_art as a whole taught away from a range of 6_to_8 mg
finally tyco contends that secondary_considerations of new and unexpected_results and commercial_success support a finding of non-obviousness

a. tyco contests the district_courts interpretation of the bnf_reference
it relies on the declaration of its expert dr. william orr who stated that` [ a ] person of ordinary_skill in the art would not interpret [ the bnf ] reference as recommending any particular_dose'
the district_court however concluded that dr._orr had not offered a factual basis for his conclusion or explained his rationale and therefore discredited his characterization of the bnf

in support of his interpretation of the bnf_reference dr._orr stated that the bnf_reference` nowhere states that a temazepam dose of 5 mg 6_to_8 mg or 7.5 mg is effective in treating insomnia' nor does it` state that 7.5 mg was effective'
he added that the bnf_reference provides` [ n ] o clinical or statistical evidence.. demonstrating that a dose within a range of 5-15 mg would work' in treating insomnia

those statements by dr._orr correctly describe the contents of the bnf_reference but they do not undermine the district_courts conclusions as to obviousness
the ¡¬954_claims do not discuss the intended use of the capsules in a particular treatment regimen
the manufacture of a 7.5 mg_temazepam_capsule with the disclosed claim limitations would infringe both claims of the ¡¬954_patent irrespective of the efficacy of the product
dr._orrs statements did not contest the fact that the bnf refers to dosages of temazepam between 5_and_15 mg.3 his statements are directed to the utility of temazepam as a treatment for insomnia

tyco argues that all the properties of a composition of matter relevant to patentability must be considered in evaluating whether that composition would have been obvious in light of the prior_art and that the unclaimed property of effectiveness in treating insomnia renders the claims at issue nonobvious
that argument is unavailing
`` the discovery of a new property or use of a previously known composition even when that property and use are unobvious from the prior_art can not impart patentability to the known composition'
in re spada 911_f.2d_705 708 fed.cir.1990 noting that` a new use of a known composition.. may be patentable as a process'
the recommendation in the *1374 bnf of a range of temazepam_dosages that include the dosages claimed in the ¡¬954_patent renders obvious the claims to those dosages even in the absence of documentation in the bnf of the effectiveness of such dosages

dr._orr noted that the bnf_reference listed several brands of commercially available temazepam formulations which had dosages of 10 mg and 20 mg but not 5 mg. that observation however does not call into doubt what the bnf_reference disclosed
tyco does not dispute that at the time the bnf was published 5 mg temazepam hard_capsules had been sold abroad for more than a decade under the name levanxolthe_r
in addition the record contains two prior_art publications discussing experimentation with 5 mg_capsules a 1970 italian study` senini' and a 1974 indian study` sardesai'

finally dr._orr stated that one of skill in the art reading the preface to the bnf_reference` would understand that one must look to otherspecialised publications'-i.e. scientific publications relating to the effectiveness of temazepam doses-in order to determine whether any particular_dose is effective'
again dr._orrs position does not undermine the bnf as a supporting reference
first as already discussed the ¡¬954_claims are not tied to product efficacy so the absence of any particularized discussion of efficacy in the bnf_reference is immaterial to obviousness of the composition here claimed in light of the prior_art showing general efficacy for the same use
second none of the specialized_publications cited by dr._orr and tyco undermine the teaching of the bnf_reference that a person of ordinary_skill in the art could consider temazepam_dosages between 5 mg and 15 mg to treat insomnia

b
two of the specialized_publications cited by tyco are articles from the 1970s by the same authors` nicholson 1976' and` nicholson 1979'
the first reference nicholson 1976 described a sleep_study conducted with six males between the ages of 19_and_43
the experimenters administered 10 mg and 20 mg_doses of temazepam to the subjects
the experiment disclosed that 10 mg_temazepam_doses produced a` marked reduction in sleep_onset_latency' -i.e. the time it takes a person to fall asleep-but resulted in` little or no increase in total_sleep_time'

tyco argues that nicholson 1976 taught that 10 mg_capsules were` ineffective because they do not affect thekey requirement of total_sleep_time'
according to tyco` effectiveness as a sleeping_pill requires both that sleep_latency is decreased and total_sleep_time is increased'
tyco cites the ¡¬ 954 patent dr._orrs declaration and a 1983 publication` matejcek' in support of that proposition
the ¡¬954_patent discusses experimental findings that 7.5 mg_temazepam_capsules reduced sleep_onset_latency and increased total_sleep_time
¡¬954_patent col._2,_ll._32-34
dr._orr declared that` [ t ] he only means to conclusively verify a hypnotic agents effect on sleep patterns is to conduct studies specifically designed to record additional polysomnographic parameters such as total_sleep_time and sleep_latency' because only such studies` give reliable indications of whether any particular treatment is effective'
matejcek discussed further below stated that` effects on the sequence duration and relative depth of individual sleep stages.. have been used to estimate latency to sleep onset and the relative potency and duration of drug activity'
although each of those sources refers to both sleep_onset_latency and total sleep *1375 time none states that a sleeping_pill must achieve improvement on both parameters in order to be considered effective
therefore the evidence in the record does not support tycos contention that nicholson 1976 taught away from 10 mg_temazepam_doses

tyco also points out that nicholson 1976 taught that 20 mg_temazepam_capsules are effective for treatment of insomnia
the study found a statistically significant increase in total_sleep_time and decrease in sleep_onset_latency following administration of 20 mg_temazepam_capsules
however that result is not pertinent to the issue in this case because it does not teach away from the efficacy of 7.5 mg_capsules

the second reference nicholson 1979 described a sleep_study conducted with six middle-aged males between the ages of 45_and_55
the experimenters administered 10 20 and 30 mg_doses of temazepam
the experimental_results revealed no statistically significant change in total_sleep_time or sleep_onset_latency after administration of any of those dosages of temazepam
all three dosages however resulted in statistically significant reductions in the duration of awakenings during the night

tyco contends that` the temazepam soft_capsules produced in the older group amarked reduction in total_sleep_time and anincrease in latency to certain sleep stages exactly the opposite of what one wants in a sleep aid'
the portion of nicholson 1979 from which those quotations were drawn however discusses a comparison of general sleep patterns between young adults ages 20_to_29 and middle-aged adults using a placebo treatment for both groups
apart from that mischaracterization of the nicholson 1979 reference the only point that tyco makes about that study is that no dosage of temazepam-10 20 or 30 mg-yielded a statistically significant improvement in total_sleep_time or sleep_onset_latency

tyco also relies on matejcek which described a daytime experiment administering various dosages of temazepam to 12 males between the ages of 20_and_30
that study like those disclosed in the sendai and sardesai references included the use of 5 mg_capsules of temazepam
tyco seizes on a remark in the` results' section of the article in which the authors stated that` temazepam 5-mg values were excluded from the test_procedure [ measuring a particular type of brain wave activity ] since this dose is known to be of no clinical importance as a hypnotic'
contrary to that statement matejcek did include 5 mg_temazepam_capsules in its test_procedure and displayed results for those capsules in two tables in the article
those tables revealed a statistically insignificant decrease in` alpha-activity' for 5 mg_dosages of temazepam and statistically significant decreases for 15 mg and 30 mg_dosages

tyco argues that` matejcek would have directly discouraged [ a person of ordinary_skill in the art ] from the idea that hard_capsules with 7.5 mg of temazepam would be effective to treat insomnia'
that argument is predicated on the position taken by tyco in this court that the effectiveness of particular_doses of temazepam depends on whether the capsule is hard or soft
according to tyco each milligram of temazepam delivered in soft capsule form is equivalent to 1.5 mg delivered in hard capsule form
therefore tyco asserts the fact that the 5 mg_temazepam_capsule had statistically insignificant effects on certain brain wave activity would have cast doubt on the efficacy of the claimed 7.5 mg_capsules

there are two problems with tycos argument
first the matejcek_study did not identify whether hard or soft_capsules *1376 were used in its experiment
the prosecuting attorney for the ¡¬954_patent represented to the pto that matejcek` clearly state [ s ]' that the capsules used were soft_capsules but there is no support for that statement in the record
after mutual pointed out the lack of evidence on that point in its brief tyco refrained from characterizing the matejcek capsule as a soft capsule in its reply_brief

second the only prior_art reference in the record before this court that could conceivably have given rise to tycos alleged 1:1.5 efficacy ratio is a published article from 1977` fuccella 1977'
that reference disclosed an experiment on six males between the ages of 21_and_33 using both soft and hard_capsules of temazepam and the last paragraph of the article states it is interesting that in a study of its effect on sleep temazepam 20 mg in scherer capsules was significantly better than 30 mg of the same substance in hard conventional capsules according to a subjective evaluation of quality of sleep awakening from sleep and impairment of behaviour [ reference ]
the results of these studies are in keeping with bioavailability from soft gelatin capsules and the pharmacokinetic profile of temazepam
essentially tycos argument is based on a passing mention in an article of a subjective_sleep_evaluation_study described in another article in which 20 mg soft_capsules performed better than 30 mg hard_capsules
however tyco did not refer to either of those articles as relevant prior_art in its opening brief
moreover according to tycos own argument that measurement of several objective sleep parameters e.g. sleep_onset_latency and total_sleep_time is required to evaluate the efficacy of a sleeping_pill the subjective_sleep_evaluation_study that could ultimately have led to tycos 1:1.5 ratio would not have been able to measure sleeping_pill efficacy with accuracy
nor did the matejcek_study measure those parameters
in sum tycos argument that the matejcek reference teaches away from use of a 7.5 mg hard capsule of temazepam to treat insomnia is not supported by evidence in the record

furthermore none of the relevant references cited by tyco4-nicholson 1977 nicholson 1979 and matejcek-studied the effects of temazepam on elderly_patients
the bnf_reference specifically directed readers to a lower_dosage of temazepam for the elderly given the increased risk of side_effects such as ataxia
even if the references cited by tyco could be viewed as teaching away from the use of 7.5 mg_temazepam_capsules generally it would not cast doubt on the bnf_references dosage_range for elderly_patients
to the contrary nicholson 1979 cited other studies` suggest [ ing ] that hypnotics may have an enhanced effect in old age' including` increased sensitivity' and an increased` effect on performance'
if anything such statements viewed in light of the undisputed preference of physicians for prescribing the lowest effective dosage of temazepam point toward the use of lower-dosage capsules

*1377 c. tyco argues that secondary_considerations support a finding of non-obviousness of the ¡¬954_claims
it contends that the experimental_results described in the ¡¬954_patent were unexpected
in support tyco cites the patent specifications description of the inventors experimental_results as` unexpected'
¡¬954_patent col.2 ll.34-36
unsupported statements in the specification however can not support a finding of unexpected_results
in re de blauwe 736_f.2d_699 705 fed.cir.1984

tyco also contends that` experts expressed skepticism about.. possible effectiveness at the time the invention was made'
it first cites a memorandum prepared by the original assignee of the ¡¬954_patent memorializing a 1984 meeting
that document relates the opinion of a` sleep expert consultant' that transient insomniacs might require a higher dosage of temazepam for treatment than chronic insomniacs
since the products disclosed by the claims at issue are not limited to treatment for transient insomnia that statement is of little relevance to the question whether 7.5 mg_capsules were unexpectedly effective
in any event the district_court did not find evidence in the memorandum casting doubt on the efficacy of 7.5 mg_capsules

tyco next points to a 1985 letter sent by an fda_expert to the company employing the named inventor asking the company to` provide the rationale for the choice of the 7.5 mg dosage' in its experiment
the motivation for that request was not disclosed in the letter
that letter provides no indication that the fda_expert would have been surprised at the results disclosed in the ¡¬ 954 patent

tyco also cites dr._orrs declaration that in light of the prior_art already discussed the results of the inventors experiment would have been surprising at the time
that statement is entitled to little weight in light of the lack of support in the record for dr._orrs interpretation of the prior_art
tyco does not supply further evidence of unexpected_results other than citations to the prior_art previously discussed
on the evidence and argument in the summary_judgment record tyco has not overcome mutuals clear and convincing showing of obviousness

finally tyco argues that the commercial_success of restorilthe_r 7.5 mg_capsules supports a finding of nonobviousness
it notes that over the past decade annual sales of the capsules have averaged more than $ 30 million
the district_court acknowledged the products commercial_success but properly found that the evidence as a whole did not overcome mutuals strong prima facie case of obviousness
see ryko mfg co. v. nu-star inc. 950_f.2d_714 719 fed.cir.1991 ; see also ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 413 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) upholding district_courts summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness despite evidence of commercial_success ; anderson's-black rock inc. v. pavement salvage co. 396_u.s._57 61 90_s.ct._305 24_l.ed.2d_258_(1969)
we therefore uphold the summary_judgment determination of the district_court that the two claims of the ¡¬954_patent are invalid for obviousness
in light of our decision mutuals motion to strike portions of tycos reply_brief is denied as moot

the district_courts interpretation of the bnf_reference is consistent with evidence in the record of a statement made in 1984 by an fda representative to a group that included the named inventor of the ¡¬ 954 patent
according to notes of a meeting to discuss a` proposed course of action to further characterize the profile of [ restoril ]' dr. hillary lee of the fda stated that` the doses proposed in [ the ] studies may be too high citing that in great_britain temazepam doses from 5-15 mg are recommended for geriatrics and doses from 15-30 mg for adults'
3
at oral argument tycos counsel argued that dr._orrs declaration should be interpreted to mean that the reference to` 5-15 mg' did not disclose all dosages between 5_and_15 mg
counsel argued that the bnf_reference` while it has 5_dash_15 a person of ordinary_skill in the art would know that it can not refer to 7.5 specifically
it refers to 5 arguably perhaps a 10 perhaps a 15..' that argument is silly
not only is it contrary to the ordinary understanding that a dash joining two numbers signifies the end points of an inclusive range but it also is at odds with dr._orrs own reference to` 5-15 mg' as constituting a` range'
4
tyco argues that` as late as 1989 the fda recommended ausual hard capsule adult dose of 30 mg.. [ and ] counseled that a hard capsule dose of 15 mgmay be sufficient in some patients
`` in support it cites to a page of the 1989 edition of the physicians desk reference a medical_reference_book published commercially
the passages quoted by tyco do not suggest that dosages less than 15 mg would be insufficient in all patients
in fact the reference notes that` the risk of development of oversedation dizziness confusion and/or ataxia increases substantially with larger doses of benzodiazepines in elderly and debilitated patients..' end of document
