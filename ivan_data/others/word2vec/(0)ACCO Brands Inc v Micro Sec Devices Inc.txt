discussion
the ¡¬989_patent is directed to a locking mechanism for portable_electronic_devices such as computers
claim 10 is the only claim in suit 10
a locking system comprising a portable_electronic_device including an exterior wall defining a security_slot ; cable means for attaching to a first object other than to the portable_electronic_device ; a housing proximate to said electronic device and including a slot_engagement_member having a slot_engaging_portion provided with a locking member having a peripheral profile complementary to preselected dimensions of said security_slot to thereby permit said locking member to extend into said slot said slot_engagement_member being rotatable between an unlocked_position wherein said locking member is removable from the slot and a locked_position wherein said *1077 locking member is retained within the slot ; a pin coupled through said housing for extending into said security_slot_proximate said slot_engaging_portion when said slot_engagement_member is in said locked_position to thereby inhibit rotation of said slot_engagement_member to said unlocked_position ; and
means coupled to said housing for attaching said cable to said housing
( emphasis added

the accused pc_guardian_devices are the notebook_guardian 2000 and notebook_guardian 2001
the district_court construed the` pin' clause to require that the pin actively extends into the security_slot when the slot_engagement_member is in the locked_position and that the pin thereby inhibits rotation to the unlocked_position [ the pin is ] a post or peg coupled through said housing for extending into said security_slot_proximate said slot_engaging_portion at or during the time that said slot_engagement_member is in said locked_position to thereby inhibit rotation of said slot_engagement_member to said unlocked_position

kensington challenges this claim_construction and its application to avoid infringement by the pc_guardian_devices

i
an infringement_analysis requires that the court determine the scope and meaning of the claims asserted and compare the construed claims to the allegedly infringing device
cybor corp. v. fas technologies inc. 138_f.3d_1448 1454 46_uspq2d_1169 1172 fed.cir.1998 en banc
we give plenary review to the district_courts claim_construction id.at 1455 138_f.3d_1448 46 uspq2d at 1173 and to the summary_judgment of non-infringement
conroy v. reebok international ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994

a
the parties dispute whether the clause` for extending into said security_slot_proximate said slot_engaging_portion when said slot_engagement_member is in said locked_position' describes a functional attribute of the pin or a purely structural one
at the district_court the parties agreed that in this context` when' means` at or during the time that' and on appeal they frame the question as whether` extending' is an` active_verb' or a` state of being'
the district_court ruled that` extending' is used as an active_verb and that the pin must extend at or during the time that the slot_engagement_member is in the locked_position
kensington states that the courts construction is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the claim language that the court improperly excluded the embodiments of patent figures 11_and_13 from the scope of the claims and that this construction violates the doctrine of claim differentiation because during reexamination` when' was amended to` after' in other claims which are presumptively of different scope but was not amended in claim 10

the specification shows that in operation of the patented device the slot_engagement_member is first placed in the security_slot and then rotated to reach the locked_position
the pin extends into the slot and prevents rotation to the unlocked_position
the specification describes some embodiments in which the pin is extended into the slot before the slot_engagement_member is rotated and others wherein the pin is extended after the locked_position is reached *1078 by rotation
the ¡¬989_patent a divisional in a family of patents claiming priority to u.s
application ser
no._07 /824,964 is directed to the invention exemplified in figure 14 depicting an embodiment in which the pin is extended after the slot_engagement_member is in locked_position
figure 14 is shown on the front_page of the ¡¬989_patent
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.84 j` one of the [ drawings ] should be suitable for inclusion on the front_page of the patent application publication and patent as the illustration of the invention'
the claim states that the pin is` for extending' when the slot_engagement_member is in locked_position that is after it is in the slot and rotated
viewed in light of the specification the phrase` for extending' is a functional restriction on the pin
see e.g. k-2 corp. v. salomon s.a. 191_f.3d_1356 1363 52_uspq2d_1001 1004 fed.cir.1999` the functional language is of course an additional limitation in the claim'
kensingtons argument that` for extending' describes a` state of being' that encompasses a pin that extends into the slot before locking is negated by the explanation and argument during prosecution
we conclude as did the district_court that the participle` extending' refers to an action occurring when the slot_engagement_member is rotated to and in the locked_position

during prosecution of the reexamination application in response to a rejection of independent_claims 1 10 and 11_under_35 u.s.c.¡± 103 the applicant described the device of the jacobi reference with` a pin 25 is movable when the locking member is in the locked_position to prevent the locking member from rotating' and also distinguished the reference on other grounds
in addressing a rejection of claims 1-big_token__3_under_35__big_token u.s.c.¡± 102 and ¡± 103 based on the young_reference the applicant distinguished the pin argued that` for extending' is a functional recitation that must be given patentable weight and identified` when said slot_engagement_member is in said locked_position' as a limitation not present in the references
the examiner accepted this argument which the applicant consistently applied to the pin element of independent_claims 1 10_and_11 and withdrew rejections related to the young_reference stating` in young the slot_engagement_member 60 is put into its locking position when the pin enters the slot.. because young fails to teach a pin coupled through the hous [ ing ] which extends into the security_slot after the slot_engagement_member is in the locked_position the 102 rejection was improper'
statements made during prosecution which clearly disclaim a particular claim interpretation will limit the scope of the claims
ballard medical products v. allegiance healthcare corp. 268_f.3d_1352 1359 60_uspq2d_1493 1498 fed.cir.2001
see southwall_technologies inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1576 34_uspq2d_1673 1676 fed.cir.1995` the prosecution history limits the interpretation of claim terms so as to exclude any interpretation that was disclaimed during prosecution'

the young_reference was cited against claims 1-3
kensington then amended independent claim 1 changing` for extending.. when' to` and extending..
after'
kensington also made changes to other aspects of claims 1_and_10 responsive to other rejections
the examiner then issued a notice of intent to issue reexamination certificate with a statement of reasons for allowance which reiterated his understanding that the pin is extended after the slot_engagement_member is in locked_position the following is an examiners statement of reasons for allowance the instant invention is allowable over the prior_art of record in that the prior_art fails to *1079 teach or make obvious a computer locking system combining a computer having an aperture with a locking assembly as particularly claimed
in particular the prior_art fails to teach or make obvious a computer locking assembly having a locking member which is rotatable to a locked_position after being placed through an opening in a computer having a configuration matching that of the locking member and subsequently a pin being placed into the opening after the locking member is rotated to the locked_position to hold the lock device within the computer such that the computer can be locked to another object using a cable to prevent theft of the computer
kensington did not respond to this statement
although there is no obligation to respond to an examiners statement of reasons for allowance and the statement of an examiner will not necessarily limit a claim bell atlantic network services inc. v. covad communications group inc. 262_f.3d_1258 1273 59_uspq2d_1865 1874 fed.cir.2001 in this case the examiner simply repeated the arguments that the patentee had presented

the pin was claimed in original claim 10 in the same terms as in claim 1 but claim 10 was not amended
although kensington argues that the examiners reasons for allowance apply only to the claims in which` for extending.. when' was replaced with` and extending.. after' during reexamination the examiner made no such distinction and kensington made no arguments for claim 10 that could suggest that this statement did not apply to all the claims
see tandon corp. v. united_states_international_trade_comm n 831_f.2d_1017 1023 4_uspq2d_1283 1288 fed.cir.1987 recognizing that` two claims which read differently can cover the same subject matter'

we conclude that the pin_clause of claim 10 must be construed in the same way as the pin_clause of claim 1 for the examiners reasons for allowance make clear that the examiner and the applicant understood that the invention requires that the pin extends actively into the slot after rotation
see modine mfg co. v. united_states_international_trade_comm n 75_f.3d_1545 1551 37_uspq2d_1609 1612 fed.cir.1996` [ i ] t is incorrect to construe a claim as encompassing the scope that was relinquished in order to obtain allowance of another claim despite a difference in the words used
``

kensington also argues that the specification includes embodiments shown in figures 11_and_13 that are not within the scope of claim 10 as construed by the district_court
however embodiments in which the pin extends through the slot before rotating to locked_position were claimed in u.s. patent no._5381,685 not in suit
the ¡¬989_patent is a division related to the ¡¬685_patent and was filed in response to a restriction requirement
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 121` if two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in one application the commissioner may require the application to be restricted to one of the inventions'
the ¡¬685_patent contains claims that do not limit pin extension temporally and claims that require that the pin extends into the slot before the slot_engagement_member is rotated to locked_position
figure 14 was selected` as the illustration of the invention' of the ¡¬989_patent
see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.84 j
the presence in the ¡¬989 specification of embodiments carried over from the parent application but claimed in other patents does not serve to broaden the scope of the ¡¬989 claims that were the subject of the divisional application

*1080 b
the parties also dispute the meaning of` pin.. for extending.. to thereby inhibit rotation of said slot_engagement_member to said unlocked_position'
kensington argues that the district_court improperly construed this clause to require that the pin directly interfere with rotation of the lock thereby improperly adding an extraneous limitation to the claim and excluding the embodiments of figures 3-15 from the scope of the claim
pc_guardian responds that the district_court adopted the ordinary meaning of this clause as was argued by kensington during the claim_construction hearing
pc_guardian also states that the district_court correctly construed the claim to require that rotation of the slot_engagement_member` to said unlocked_position' must be inhibited by extension of the pin

we confirm the district_courts construction of this clause
the specification shows that the pin extends through the security_slot to prevent rotation of the slot_engagement_member into the unlocked_position and removal from the slot
in the embodiments of figures 3-15 the pin inhibits rotation of the slot_engagement_member to the unlocked_position by extending through the security_slot and maintaining the position of the lock housing in relation to the slot and the slot_engagement_member
those embodiments therefore are consistent with the prosecution record and are not excluded from the scope of this element as correctly construed
we conclude that the claim requires a pin that can be extended into the security_slot and thereby inhibit rotation of the slot_engagement_member between the locked and unlocked_positions

ii
the district_court found no infringement literally or under the doctrine of equivalents based on its construction that claim 10 does not include a pin that extends into the security_slot before the slot_engagement_member is rotated to the locked_position

a. literal infringement requires that every element of the invention as claimed is present in the accused device
southwall_technologies 54 f.3d at 1575 34 uspq2d at 1676
infringement by equivalents requires that the accused device contains elements identical or equivalent to each element of the claim
warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chemical co. 520_u.s._17 40 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1875 1997

the two accused pc_guardian_devices are of similar structure and operation as illustrated below

?
*1081 the hook_arm the slot_engagement_member of claim 10 rotates out from a recess in the flanged_tab_structure the pin into locked_position
in use the flanged_tab_structure and the hook_arm are inserted together into a security_slot in the portable_electronic_device and the hook_arm is pivoted into the locked_position when the key is turned
kensingtons technical witness david dornfield agreed with this method of operation` in both accused products the pin-the flanged_tab_structure-extends into the slot before the slot_engagement_member-the hook_arm-is placed in the locked_position'

on this basis the district_court found no literal_infringement for the hook_arm and flanged_tab_structure of the pc_guardian products are inserted simultaneously and before the cam is rotated to place the hook_arm in the locked_position
the flanged_tab of the accused devices can not be extended into the security_slot when the hook_arm is in locked_position
moreover the extension of the flanged_tab into the slot has no effect on the pivoting or rotation of the hook_arm to its locked_position ; instead in the pc_guardian_devices it is the cam not the flanged_tab_structure that inhibits movement of the hook_arm

while kensington argues that the flanged_tab inhibits rotation to the unlocked_position because in its absence the hook_arm may be rotated and removed from the slot this assertion is without support
the pin does not in fact prevent rotation to the unlocked_position ; the unlocked_position is achieved solely by extending or retracting the hook_arm
thus the tab could not be extended when the slot_engagement_member is in locked_position and the lock could not attain a locked_position
the slot_engagement_member would not rotate between an unlocked_position wherein the locking member is removable from the slot and a locked_position as required by claim 10
these operational facts are not disputed
we therefore affirm the summary_judgment that there is no literal_infringement of claim 10

b. kensington also argues that the mode of operation of pc_guardians flanged_tab_structure is insubstantially different from that of the pin of claim 10 even under the district_courts claim_construction stating` whether the pin in the accused device extends before or after the slot_engagement_member is rotated to the locked_position is an insubstantial difference'
however this difference was a focus of the reexamination and the basis of the amendment to distinguish the young patent
in the pc_guardian_devices the pin extends into the slot before the hook_arm is moved into locked_position whereas the claim requires that the pin extends when or after the slot_engagement_member is moved
whether the pin extends before at the time of or after the slot_engagement_member is locked was a distinction from the prior_art and a distinction between embodiments subject to restriction
when a claim amendment was made to distinguish the prior_art at the point of difference between the claim and the accused device the difference can not be viewed as insubstantial because it was necessary for patentability on reexamination
the courts findings that the pc_guardian_devices are not equivalent to the claimed invention and thus do not give rise to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents must be sustained

kensington also argues that the district_court erroneously compared the pc_guardian_devices to` the kensington_product' rather than to the invention as claimed
the language of the claim not the patent owners commercial product is *1082 the measure of infringement
amstar corp. v. envirotech corp. 730_f.2d_1476 1481-82 221_uspq_649 653 fed.cir.1984
pc_guardian responds that the district_court merely used the term` product' to refer to the properly construed claim
although the court indeed referred to` the kensington_product' in its infringement_analysis the court also compared the construed claim to the pc_guardian_devices
we discern no reversible error in this analysis

the judgment of noninfringement is

affirmed
