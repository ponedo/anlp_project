ficosa north america corporation fico_cables s.a. and ficosa north america s.a. de c.v.` ficosa' appeal the final_judgment of the u.s. district court for the eastern_district of michigan entered in favor of teleflex inc.` teleflex'
the district_court entered judgment following a jury_verdict that ficosa infringed teleflexs u.s. patent no._5632,182` the ¡¬182_patent` and that teleflexs u.s. patent no._4581,953` the ¡¬953_patent` and the ¡¬182_patent were not invalid
ficosa appeals the denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' of non-infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent the grant of summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation in the ¡¬182_patent the denial of its jmol_motion of invalidity of the ¡¬ 182 patent and the denial of its jmol_motion of invalidity of the ¡¬953_patent
because the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation and substantial_evidence supports the jury_verdict of infringement and validity we affirm the district_courts decision on appeal

background
teleflex is the assignee of the ¡¬182_patent and the ¡¬953_patent
the ¡¬ 182 patent is directed to a` serviceable_clip_core_coupling' which is a component of a two-piece_shift_cable installed by general_motors` gm' in certain sport utility vehicles
the two-piece_shift_cable connects the shift_knob with the automatic transmission of the sport utility vehicle so that when a driver moves the shift_knob e.g. from` park' to` drive' the transmission is engaged
the two-piece cable allows gm to wait until an advanced stage of the manufacturing process before putting the two pieces together and permits the cable to be taken apart later for servicing

claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent recites

1
a motion transmitting remote control assembly 10 comprising a first_core_element_section 12 for transmitting motion ; a first guide length for movably supporting said first_core_element_section 12 ; a second_core_element_section 14 for transmitting motion ; a second guide length for movably supporting said second_core_element_section 14 ; connection means for locking said first 12 and second 14 core_element_sections together in a locked_position mechanically prevented from moving relative to one another axially in either direction ; and
characterized by said connection means including a clip 28 manually insertable into and manually removable from said locked_position mechanically interlocking said core_element_sections together while moving axially within said guide_lengths said connection means including a female_member 24 attached to an end of said first_core_element_section 12 and a male_member 26 defining an end of said second_core_element_section 14 said male_member 26 presenting a male_groove 30 said female_member 24 having at least one slot 32 extending tangentially therethrough said clip 28 being disposed about said female_member 24 and extending through said_slot 32 and into said male_groove *1319 30 for mechanically interlocking said core_element_sections together in said locked_position
'182_patent col._3,_ll._45-66 col._4,_ll._1-10 emphases added

the parties disputed at trial the interpretation of the claim_term` clip 28'
the district_court construed the term in the jury_instructions as follows in claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent the term` clip' means a structure that has a single_pair of legs which provide the dual_functions of disposing the clip around and holding the female_member through the slots in the female_member and extending through the slots into the groove in the male_member to lock the members together

figure 1 of the ¡¬182_patent is reproduced below

?
the ¡¬953_patent is directed to a` molded terminal with vibration dampener pocket'
the ¡¬953_patent describes an invention that allows for attachment of the shift cable to the shift_knob and the transmission in a manner that minimizes noise and vibration transmitted from the transmission to the shift_knob

claim 1 of the ¡¬953_patent recites 1
a motion transmitting remote control assemly [ sic ] 10 for transmitting motion in a curved path said assembly 10 comprising guide_means 12 ; core_means 18 movably supported by said guide_means 12 and extending therefrom to provide a variable extending length of said core_means 18 between said guide_means 12 and one end 20 therefor to define a line of force ; and an integral terminal_member 22 for operatively interconnecting said extending length of said core_means 18 and a control_member 24 through a ball_pin 32 and having an opening 36 therethrough defining an axis being perpendicular relative to said line of force said terminal_member 22 including a resilient integral vibration dampening member 38 totally encapsulated therein and defining a portion of said opening 36 and including a retaining pocket for retaining the ball_pin 32 of the control_member 24 therein said retaining pocket including a resilient cylindrical wall 40 and an annular integral flexible flange 42 extending into said opening 36 from said wall 40 for engaging and retaining the ball_pin 32 extending from the control_member 24 within *1320 said cylindrical wall 40 said vibration dampening member 38 further including a resilient substantially cylindrical containing pocket extending from said flexible flange 42 and away from said retaining pocket
¡¬953_patent col._4,_ll._57-68 col._5,_ll._1-14 emphases added

claim 6 of the ¡¬953_patent recites 6
an assembly as set forth in claim 1 further characterized by said terminal_member 22 including a plurality of slots 56 therethrough extending radially from said axis defined by said opening 36 about said retaining pocket of said opening 36

?
both teleflex and ficosa manufacture shift cables for automobiles
teleflex has traditionally focused on the north american market and ficosa on the european market
in 1990 they entered a joint venture to sell cables in europe but the venture was dissolved in 1997

teleflex supplied gm with two-piece_shift_cables from the inception of the` gmt-800_program' for use in gm manufactured sport utility vehicles
in 1997 teleflex learned of ficosas efforts to supply gm with cables for the gmt-800_program and the parties exchanged letters concerning possible infringement by ficosa of teleflexs patents
ficosa retained european patent counsel for an opinion concerning infringement of the european equivalent of the ¡¬182_patent

ficosa had its own design for the two-piece_shift_cable
an illustration of the ficosa counterpart to the` clip 28' recited in claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent is reproduced below

*1321. ?
on august 3 1998 teleflex sued ficosa for infringement of four patents including the ¡¬182 and ¡¬953_patent s. ficosa counterclaimed for declaratory_judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of all of the asserted patents
teleflex voluntarily withdrew its claim based on one of the four patents and the district_court granted ficosas motion for partial_summary_judgment of non-infringement of another patent
these two patents were removed from the case and the present appeal concerns only the remaining ¡¬182 and ¡¬ 953 patents

on august 30 1999 teleflex moved for partial_summary_judgment of literal_infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent which the district_court granted on december 15 1999
six days prior to trial ficosa filed a motion to vacate the ruling of literal_infringement of claim 1 in light of new evidence the september 19 2000 issuance of a patent to ficosa
the district_court granted ficosas motion and vacated its partial_summary_judgment ruling regarding claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent

the parties filed cross-motions for summary_judgment concerning violation of the best_mode_requirement in the ¡¬182_patent
ficosa argued that the inventor admitted during his deposition that he knew of a best_mode for practicing the claimed invention in the following colloquy q now that change in the clip_metal and the matching of the male_member_metal to the clip_metal was that the best_way that you had to make this cable join at the time you did this work in 1995 ?
a yeah
yep yep
yes

teleflex responded that the inventor clarified later in his deposition that the clip *1322 metal and matching of the male_member_metal to the clip_metal was done to satisfy gms requests to reduce the insertion force and connector size and the invention would work without these customer-specific details q was the change in material on the core element connect as referenced in the section of the deposition that i read to you a moment ago critical to getting the core_element_connect_design to meet general_motors specification or was it critical to getting the core_element_connect_design to work at all ?
a to meet general_motors requirements
that was the problem

on december 15 1999 the district_court granted teleflexs motion finding no violation of the best_mode_requirement
in its order the court discussed the inventors deposition testimony and then stated in cases such as this one satisfying requests of specific_customer [ sic ] can be an exception to the best_mode_rule..
in this case the ¡¬182_patent does not claim a cable_assembly for the 1999 gm full-size_pickup_truck just a cable_assembly
thus the best_mode does not include details particular to 1999 gm_pickups
teleflex conceded during closing argument that it could not prove literal_infringement of claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬953_patent

the following issues went to the jury 1 infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬ 182 patent 2 validity of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent 3 validity of claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬953_patent and 4 damages if any awarded to teleflex for infringement by ficosa of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent
on january 8 2001 the jury found claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent not invalid and infringed and found damages of $ 552,778.00
the jury also found claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬953_patent to be not invalid

the parties filed various jmol_motions after the verdict
the district_court entered final_judgment on may_9,_2001 awarding teleflex damages of $ 552,778.00 plus interest and costs and permanently enjoined ficosa from infringing the ¡¬ 182 patent

ficosa appeals the denial of its jmol_motion of non-infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent the grant of summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation in the ¡¬182_patent the denial of its jmol_motion of invalidity of the ¡¬182_patent and the denial of its jmol_motion of invalidity of the ¡¬953_patent

exclusive jurisdiction is vested in this court pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
literal infringement of the ¡¬182_patent
following the jury_verdict finding that ficosa infringed claim 1 of the ¡¬ 182 patent ficosa moved for jmol arguing there was no substantial_evidence of infringement under the district_courts claim_construction of` clip 28'
at trial ficosa had argued in favor of the claim_construction eventually adopted by the district_court ; teleflex had argued for a substantially broader claim_construction
although ficosa prevailed in its claim_construction arguments the jury decided the ultimate issue of infringement of the ¡¬182_patent in favor of teleflex

a two-step process is used in the analysis of patent infringement first the scope of the claims are determined as a matter of law and second the properly construed claims are compared to the allegedly infringing device to determine as a matter of fact whether all of the limitations of at least one claim are present either literally or by a substantial equivalent in the accused device
see johnson worldwide assocs
v. zebco corp. 175_f.3d_985 988 50_uspq2d_1607 1609 fed.cir.1999
the first of these two steps is performed by the court and is subject to de novo review by this court
cybor 138 f.3d at 1456 46 uspq2d at 1174 ; markman 52 f.3d at 979 34 uspq2d at 1329

330 338 14_l.ed._717_(1853)
if tried to a jury the jurys factual_findings pursuant to the second_step are reviewed by this court for lack of substantial_evidence see genentech 29 f.3d at 1565 31 uspq2d at 1168-69 as part of this courts reapplication of the jmol_standard
cybor 138 f.3d at 1467 46 uspq2d at 1172

in this case the parties disagree as to whether the district_court correctly performed the first_step with regard to the` clip 28' limitation in claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent
teleflex contends that` clip 28' should be construed to mean any device of any shape that holds two things together and also performs the functions of being manually insertable into and manually removable from a locked_position
teleflex argues that the claim_language does not support the construction applied by the district_court` clip' is defined nowhere in the specification or the prosecution_history and the district_court committed a` cardinal sin' of claim_construction by importing limitations from the written description into the claims
see scimed life sys. inc. v. adv
cardiovascular sys. inc. 242_f.3d_1337 1340 58_uspq2d_1059 1062 fed.cir.2001
ficosa argues that the district_court correctly construed the claim_term` clip 28'

the parties also disagree as to whether the jury correctly performed the second_step in the infringement_analysis of the ¡¬182_patent
ficosa argues that under the construction of` clip 28' as determined by the district_court the record lacks substantial_evidence on which the jury could have based its finding of infringement
teleflex argues that under either the district_courts construction of` clip 28' or teleflexs preferred construction substantial_evidence appears in the record supporting the jurys verdict of infringement of the ¡¬182_patent

we address each of the first and second_steps of the infringement_analysis below
regarding the first_step we conclude that claim_terms take on their ordinary and accustomed_meanings unless the patentee demonstrated an intent to deviate from the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of a claim_term by redefining the term or by characterizing the invention in the intrinsic_record using words or expressions of manifest_exclusion or restriction representing a clear_disavowal of claim_scope
regarding the second_step substantial_evidence appears in the record to support the jurys verdict of infringement and therefore we affirm the district_courts denial of ficosas motion for jmol

we begin our claim_construction_analysis as always with the words of the claim

ficosa argues that where only one embodiment is disclosed in the specification claim_terms are limited to the embodiment disclosed citing toro co. v. white consolidated industries inc. 199_f.3d_1295 53_uspq2d_1065_(fed.cir.1999) wang laboratories inc. v. america online inc. 197_f.3d_1377 53_uspq2d_1161_(fed.cir.1999) and bell atlantic network services inc. v. covad communications group inc. 262_f.3d_1258 59_uspq2d_1865_(fed.cir.2001)
a review of these cases and others demonstrates that our precedent establishes no such rule

in toro we considered whether a claim that recited a cover` including' a restriction ring should be construed to require attachment of the ring to the cover
199 f.3d at 1300 53 uspq2d at 1068-69
the specification described an embodiment showing the ring permanently attached to the cover and listed advantages of permanent attachment` it automatically restricts the size of air inlet depending upon which operation is being conducted without having the operator manually insert or remove a replaceable ring'
id.at 1301 53 uspq2d at 1069
in our opinion concluding that` including' required attachment we emphasized that the specification and drawings provided` context' for construction *1327 of the claims
id
we noted that` clear_statements of scope' in the specification and prosecution_history determined the correct claim_construction
id.at 1302 53 uspq2d at 1070

in wang we construed the claim_term` frame' to be limited to` character-based protocols' even though the ordinary_meaning of the term could arguably be applied to` bit-mapped protocols'
197 f.3d at 1382 53 uspq2d at 1166
although we noted that the only system described and enabled in the specification used a character-based protocol we also noted that the intrinsic_evidence did not describe bit-mapped protocols as included in the invention and a person skilled in the art would not have understood bit-mapped protocols to be included
id. 197_f.3d_1377 53 uspq2d at 1165
the applicant during prosecution distinguished the` pel [ picture element ] level' from the` character level' and presented the invention as involving a character-based system
id.at 1384 53 uspq2d at 1165
we described the correct approach to the inquiry although precedent offers assorted quotations in support of differing conclusions concerning the scope of the specification these cases must be viewed in the factual context in which they arose
whether an invention is fairly claimed more broadly than the` preferred_embodiment' in the specification is a question specific to the content of the specification the context in which the embodiment is described the prosecution_history and if appropriate the prior_art.. id.at 1383 53 uspq2d at 1165

in bell atlantic we construed the term` modes' to be limited to the three categories described in the specification
262 f.3d at 1273 59 uspq2d at 1875
although the terms ordinary_meaning may have supported a broader reading id.at 1269 59 uspq2d at 1871 we found that` the patentees defined the termmode by implication through the terms consistent use throughout the ¡¬786_patent specification'
id.at 1273 59 uspq2d at 1874
we also noted that the claim_language and the prosecution_history supported this construction
id. 262_f.3d_1258 59 uspq2d at 1875
thus we construed` modes' based on clear indications throughout the intrinsic_evidence
id.at 1273-74 59 uspq2d at 1874-76

in sum the number of embodiments disclosed in the specification is not determinative of the meaning of disputed claim_terms
as we explained in ccs_fitness an accused infringer can not overcome the` heavy_presumption' that a claim_term takes on its ordinary_meaning simply by pointing to the preferred_embodiment or other structures or steps disclosed in the specification or prosecution_history
288 f.3d at 1366 62 uspq2d at 1662
we hold that claim_terms take on their ordinary and accustomed_meanings unless the patentee demonstrated an intent to deviate from the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of a claim_term by redefining the term or by characterizing the invention in the intrinsic_record using words or expressions of manifest_exclusion or restriction representing a clear_disavowal of claim_scope

in this case nothing in the intrinsic_evidence indicates that` clip 28' should be limited to` a single_pair of legs'
the language of asserted claim 1 does not support limiting the claim to a` single_pair of legs'
neither` single' nor` pair of legs' appears in claim 1
neither the specification nor the prosecution_history includes an expression of manifest_exclusion or restriction demonstrating an intent to limit` clip 28' to a single_pair of legs
the term` clip' is not defined in the specification or in the prosecution_history and although the specification describes only one embodiment of the clip no` clear *1328 statements of scope' limit the term` clip' to having a` single_pair of legs'
furthermore the ordinary_meaning of` clip' is not restricted to having a` single_pair of legs'
the expert_witnesses for ficosa agreed that the ordinary_meaning of` clip' is broad enough to encompass the accused ficosa_device in this case

the district_court thus erred by importing the` single_pair of legs' limitation from the specification into the claim
instead of using the specification as context the district_court apparently limited the` clip 28' recited in claim 1 to the embodiment described in the specification
we have` cautioned against limiting the claimed invention to preferred_embodiments or specific examples in the specification'
see comark 156 f.3d at 1186 48 uspq2d at 1005 quoting texas instruments inc. v. united states int l trade comm n 805_f.2d_1558 1563 231_uspq_833 835 fed.cir.1986
the specification describes only one embodiment of the claimed` clip 28' but in the circumstances of this case the record is devoid of` clear_statements of scope' limiting the term appearing in claim 1 to having` a single_pair of legs'
absent such clear_statements of scope we are constrained to follow the language of the claims rather than that of the written description
see sri 775 f.2d at 1121 227 uspq at 585
to the extent that the district_court construed the term` clip' to be limited to the embodiment described in the specification rather than relying on the language of the claims we conclude that the district_court construed the claim_term` clip 28' too narrowly
we construe the term` clip 28' in claim 1 to mean a structure that provides the dual_functions of disposing the clip around and holding the female_member through the slots in the female_member and extending through the slots into the groove in the male_member to lock the members together

b
comparison to the accused device
notwithstanding this error by the district_court` [ w ] hen we determine on appeal as a matter of law that a trial judge has misinterpreted a patent_claim we independently construe the claim to determine its correct meaning and then determine if the facts presented at trial can support the appealed judgment'
exxon chem patents inc. v. lubrizol corp. 64_f.3d_1553 1560 35_uspq2d_1801 1806 fed.cir.1995
we may affirm the jurys findings on infringement or validity issues if substantial_evidence appears in the record supporting the jurys verdict and if correction of the errors in a jury_instruction on claim_construction would not have changed the result given the evidence presented
see weinar v. rollform inc. 744_f.2d_797 808 223_uspq_369 376 fed.cir.1984` [ a ] reversal.. is not available to an appellant who merely establishes error in instructions.. where the procedural error washarmless i.e. where the evidence in support of the verdict was so overwhelming that the same verdict would necessarily be reached absent the error or the error was cured by an instruction a new_trial would be mere waste and affirmance of the judgment is required
`` cert
denied 470_u.s._1084 105_s.ct._1844 85_l.ed.2d_143_(1985)
under these circumstances the error in claim_construction is harmless and does not require a new_trial
see ecolab inc. v. paraclipse inc. 285_f.3d_1362 1374 62_uspq2d_1349 1357 fed.cir.2002` when the error in a jury_instruction could not have changed the result the erroneous instruction is harmless'
( internal quotations omitted

in this case the claim_construction_error by the district_court had the effect of narrowing the scope of asserted claim 1
thus under the correct construction claim 1 encompasses a broader scope *1329 of subject_matter
if a reasonable_juror could have found literal_infringement under a more narrow reading of claim 1 then the same reasonable_juror could not have avoided finding literal_infringement under the correct broader construction of the claim
thus the district_courts error was harmless
see ecolab 285 f.3d at 1374 62 uspq2d at 1357 ; weinar 744 f.2d at 808 223 uspq at 376

the record shows that teleflexs expert testified concerning the operation and structure of the accused device including the details of the ficosa_clip
the accused ficosa cable including the clip was available to the jury as was a detailed diagram of the ficosa_clip
because the details of the ficosa_device were presented to the jury we can not say that substantial_evidence was lacking in support of the jurys finding of infringement of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent
the district_courts denial of ficosas motion for jmol of non-infringement of the ¡¬182_patent is affirmed

iii
validity of the ¡¬182_patent
ficosa argues that the ¡¬182_patent is invalid for failure to disclose the best_mode_requirement and for obviousness
we address each of these issues in turn

a
best mode
ficosa challenges the decision of the district_court granting summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation in the ¡¬182_patent
ficosa argues that the inventor of the ¡¬182_patent testified that he knew of a` best_way' of practicing the invention including providing the clip with a particular_thickness and matching the hardness of the clip and the male_member
ficosa relies on the statement of this court in chemcast corp. v. arco industries corp.` where the inventor has failed to disclose the only mode he ever contemplated of carrying out his invention the best_mode_requirement is violated'
913_f.2d_923 930 16_uspq2d_1033 1039 fed.cir.1990
the parties do not dispute that the thickness and hardness_matching_details were not included in the ¡¬182_patent disclosure

teleflex argues that the inventor after his testimony concerning` best_way' clarified that the thickness and hardness_matching_details were a function of gms requirements
teleflex contends that the inventor explained that in the absence of gms specific requirements the invention of the ¡¬182_patent would work with any particular_thickness or hardness
teleflex argues that the thickness and hardness of the materials of the clip are specific to the particular commercial embodiment of gms gmt-800_program and thus not the best_mode of the invention of the ¡¬182_patent citing christianson v. colt industries operating corp. 822_f.2d_1544 1563 3_uspq2d_1241 1255 fed.cir.1987 vacated on other_grounds 486_u.s._800 108_s.ct._2166 100_l.ed.2d_811` [ t ] hebest_mode is that of practicing the claimed invention
it has nothing to do with mass production or with sales to customers having particular requirements'
( emphasis in original

the district_court ruled in favor of teleflex and granted summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation in cases such as this one satisfying requests of specific_customer [ sic ] can be an exception to the best_mode_rule..
in this case the ¡¬182_patent does not claim a cable_assembly for the 1999 gm full-size_pickup_truck just a cable_assembly
thus the best_mode does not include details particular to 1999 gm_pickups

in our discussion of best_mode we first address the contours of the best_mode_requirement and then apply the best_mode_requirement to the present facts
as discussed in more detail below our analysis of compliance with the best_mode *1330 requirement must begin and remain focused on the language of the claim
because the alleged best_mode_information in this case involves unclaimed_subject_matter relating to production_details dictated by customer_requirements we find no error in the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation

1
the contours of the best_mode_requirement
the best_mode_requirement appears in the patent statutes at 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 first_paragraph` the specification.. shall set forth the best_mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention'
the best_mode_requirement creates a statutory bargained-for exchange by which a patentee obtains the right to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention for a certain time period and the public receives knowledge of the preferred_embodiments for practicing the claimed invention
eli_lilly & co. v. barr labs. inc. 251_f.3d_955 963 58_uspq2d_1869 1874 fed.cir.2001 cert
denied 534_u.s._1109 122_s.ct._913 151_l.ed.2d_879_(2002)

the purpose of the best_mode_requirement is to restrain inventors from applying for patents while at the same_time concealing from the public_preferred_embodiments of the inventions they have in fact conceived
see transco prods inc. v. performance contracting inc. 38_f.3d_551 560 32_uspq2d_1077 1084 fed.cir.1994
a holding of invalidity for failure to disclose the best_mode requires clear and convincing_evidence that the inventor both knew of and concealed a better mode of carrying out the claimed invention than that set forth in the specification
id

we have acknowledged that` the termmode and the phrasecarrying out the invention are not definable with precision'
wahl_instruments inc. v. acvious inc. 950_f.2d_1575 1579 21_uspq2d_1123 1126 fed.cir.1991
however in explaining its purpose we have described the best_mode_requirement as` separate and distinct' from the enablement requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 first_paragraph manifestly the sole purpose of this [ best_mode ] requirement is to restrain inventors from applying for patents while at the same_time concealing from the public_preferred_embodiments of their inventions which they have in fact conceived
in re gay 50_c.c.p.a._725 309_f.2d_769 772 135_uspq_311 315 1962 quoted in spectra-physics inc. v. coherent inc. 827_f.2d_1524 1532 3_uspq2d_1737 1742 fed.cir.1987
indeed this court has repeatedly disclaimed a link between enablement and best_mode
see e.g. glaxo inc. v. novopharm ltd. 52_f.3d_1043 1050 34_uspq2d_1565 1569 fed.cir.1995 distinguishing between enablement and best_mode

compliance with the best_mode_requirement is a question of fact which involves a two-pronged inquiry
n. telecom ltd. v. samsung elecs co. 215_f.3d_1281 1286 55_uspq2d_1065 1068 fed.cir.2000
the first prong is subjective focusing on the inventors state of mind at the time he filed the patent_application and asks whether the inventor considered a particular mode of practicing the invention to be superior to all other modes at the time of filing
id
the second prong is objective and asks whether the inventor adequately disclosed the mode he considered to be superior
see amgen inc. v. chugai pharm co. 927_f.2d_1200 1212 18_uspq2d_1016 1025-26 fed.cir.1991

with respect to both the first and second prongs` [ t ] he best_mode inquiry is directed to what the applicant regards as the invention which in turn is measured by the claims'
*1331 engel_indus. inc. v. lockformer co. 946_f.2d_1528 1531 20_uspq2d_1300 1302 fed.cir.1991
accord n. telecom 215 f.3d at 1286 55 uspq2d at 1068` as we have repeatedly held the contours of the best_mode_requirement are defined by the scope of the claimed invention.. the party asserting invalidity must show that the asserted best_mode relates directly to the claimed invention
`` ; eli_lilly 251 f.3d at 963 58 uspq2d at 1874` [ t ] he extent of information that an inventor must disclose depends on the scope of the claimed invention
`` ; chemcast 913 f.2d at 927 16 uspq2d at 1036` the other objective limitation on the extent of the disclosure required to comply with the best_mode_requirement is of course the scope of the claimed invention

`` ; zygo corp. v. wyko corp. 79_f.3d_1563 1567 38_uspq2d_1281 1284 fed.cir.1996` the focus of a section 112 inquiry is not what a particular user decides to make and sell or even in what field the invention is most likely to find success
rather in keeping with the statutory mandate our precedent is clear that the parameters of a section 112 inquiry are set by the claims
`` ; christianson 822 f.2d at 1563 3 uspq2d at 1255` [ t ] hebest_mode is that of practicing the claimed invention
``

although we have found violations of the best_mode_requirement for failure to disclose subject_matter not strictly within the bounds of the claims even in these cases the alleged best_mode_information bore a strong relationship to the claimed invention or implicated questions of concealment
see nobelpharma ab v. implant innovations inc. 141_f.3d_1059 1065 46_uspq2d_1097 1101 fed.cir.1998` critical to the production of a functional implant' ; great n. corp. v. henry molded prods. inc. 94_f.3d_1569 1572 39_uspq2d_1997 1999 fed.cir.1996` critical to practicing the claimed invention' ; dana corp. v. ipc ltd. p'ship 860_f.2d_415 420 8_uspq2d_1692 1695 fed.cir.1988` necessary to satisfactory performance' ; spectra-physics inc. v. coherent inc. 827_f.2d_1524 1537 3_uspq2d_1737 1746 fed.cir.1987` necessary to the enjoyment of the invention' ; see also engel_indus. 946 f.2d at 1531 20 uspq2d at 1302` unclaimed subject_matter is not subject to the disclosure requirements of ¡± 112 ; the reasons are pragmatic the disclosure would be boundless and the pitfalls endless
`` ; degeorge v. bernier 768_f.2d_1318 1325 226_uspq_758 763 fed.cir.1985

in degeorge the specification failed to disclose a particular` engineering level of mt/st [ word_processor ]' and the board of patent interferences found a violation of the best_mode_requirement
id
we reversed the board found no best_mode in the degeorge applications
the boards analysis however was influenced by its erroneous count construction.. because the properly construed count does not include a word_processor failure to meet the best_mode_requirement here should not arise from an absence of information on the word_processor
id

the best_mode_requirement does not extend to` production_details' including commercial considerations such as equipment on hand availability of materials relationships with suppliers or customer_requirements
young dental mfg co. v. q3 special prods. inc. 112_f.3d_1137 1144 42_uspq2d_1589 1594-95 fed.cir.1997 ; wahl_instruments 950 f.2d at 1579 21 uspq2d at 1126 ; christianson 822 f.2d at 1563 3 uspq2d at 1255

eli_lilly 251 f.3d at 963 58 uspq2d at 1874 ; young dental 112 f.3d at 1144 42 uspq2d at 1595
routine details need not be disclosed because one skilled in the art is aware of alternative means for accomplishing the routine detail that would still produce the best_mode of the claimed invention
eli_lilly 251 f.3d at 966 58 uspq2d at 1877

2
application of the best_mode_requirement
we begin our application of the best_mode_requirement with the language of the claim
claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent recites a clip 28 manually insertable into and manually removable from said locked_position mechanically interlocking said core_element_sections together while moving axially within said guide_lengths.. said clip 28 being disposed about said female_member 24 and extending through said_slot 32 and into said male_groove 30 for mechanically interlocking said core_element_sections together in said locked_position
'182_patent col._3,_ll._45-66 col._4,_ll._1-10
the claims do not mention any particular material hardness or material matching for the clip
the claims do not mention any particular_thickness for the clip
thus the information alleged to be part of the best_mode and alleged to be missing from the disclosure is unclaimed_subject_matter

here the relationship between the alleged missing information and the claimed invention does not implicate the best_mode_requirement
the inventor stated that the particular_hardness-matching and thickness of the clip was not necessary for operability of the invention of the ¡¬182_patent but instead was dictated by the size and axial force specifications of general_motors
nothing in the record refers to axial_forces except for a statement in a parent application issued as u.s. pat
no._5577,415 and even there axial_forces are not discussed in the context of the thickness or material of the clip
this reference does not indicate that the thickness or material information is best_mode_information with respect to the claimed invention of the ¡¬182_patent

the inventor testified that the clip_thickness and hardness matching of the materials were not necessary to carry out the invention but instead were dictated by customer_requirements q so as you understand it mr. reasoner the design of a serviceable core element connect set forth in the ¡¬182_patent can work with clips of a variety of thicknesses ?
[ objection ] a to answer your question definitely yes
you can if the general_motors requirement when it came back and said mike design it to 50 pound installation efforts i could use everything standard and made an assembly a lot cheaper for teleflex

* * * * * * q focusing for a moment on the hardness of the male_terminal and the clip was it necessary to use this particular_hardness for the ¡¬182 design as pictured in the ¡¬182_patent to work ?
[ objection ] a not to work
if again if the requirements from general_motors or any customer anybody who would have used looked at this patent 100 pound snap-in efforts not a problem
give me a hundred mills longer on the male_terminal not a problem
you could have hard-hard slip soft-soft terminal and theyd go together

thus rather than showing a material_fact in dispute the evidence demonstrates *1333 that the alleged best_mode_information the clip_thickness and hardness matching information was instead another example of production_details that the law excepts from best_mode disclosure
see eli_lilly 251 f.3d at 965 58 uspq2d at 1876

where the alleged best_mode_information relates to production_details dictated by specific_customer_requirements and does not fall within the scope of the claims we can not say that the district_court erred in its finding that there is no genuine issue of material_fact regarding violation of the best_mode_requirement
accordingly we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation in the ¡¬182_patent

b. obviousness
ficosa argues that the district_court erred by denying its jmol_motion of invalidity of the ¡¬182_patent based on obviousness
ficosa contends claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent is obvious over any one of several combinations of prior_art_references including references from the` hose_art'
ficosa acknowledges that the requisite suggestion or motivation to combine is missing from these references see yamanouchi pharm co. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 231_f.3d_1339 1343 56_uspq2d_1641 1644 fed.cir.2000 but contends that the required motivation may be found in the prior_art itself and in the nature of the problem to be solved see brown & williamson tobacco corp. v. philip morris inc. 229_f.3d_1120 1124-25 56_uspq2d_1456 1459 fed.cir.2000

teleflex argues in response that substantial_evidence in the record supports the jurys verdict including the testimony of expert_witnesses that combinations of the cited references would not work
teleflex argues that the cited references fail to disclose all limitations of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent for example that the slots in the female_member are not disclosed in references within the analogous arts
teleflex further argues that certain references relied upon by ficosa are from fields of non-analogous art and the question of whether the` hose_art' is analogous was a fact question for the jury
see in re paulsen 30_f.3d_1475 1481 31_uspq2d_1671 1675 fed.cir.1994
teleflex contends that ficosa failed to present evidence of motivation to combine and that the record contains substantial_evidence of commercial_success showing objective indicia of non-obviousness
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)

in analyzing validity` [ t ] he first_step involves the proper_interpretation of the claims
the second_step involves determining whether the limitations of the claims as properly interpreted are met by the prior_art'
beachcombers int l inc. v. wildewood creative prods. inc. 31_f.3d_1154 1160 31_uspq2d_1653 1658 fed.cir.1994

given a proper_interpretation of the claim see section ii.a supra we must determine whether or not ficosa has shown that no reasonable_juror in performing the second_step of the analysis could have found less than clear and convincing_evidence of obviousness including the required motivation to combine
we agree with teleflex that ficosa failed to make such a showing

although ficosa argues that a motivation to combine the cited references may be found in the prior_art itself the evidence presented by teleflex contradicted that assertion
dr._peterson teleflexs expert witness testified that the prior_art combinations cited by ficosa failed to suggest using a clip with the dickirson reference
dr._peterson commented on the testimony of dr. radcliffe ficosas expert and testified that he erroneously used the teachings of the ¡¬182_patent in hindsight to *1334 suggest the use of a clip to solve the problem
thus the record shows substantial_evidence supporting the jurys finding of validity

moreover the evidence supporting validity remains unaffected by our correction of the district_courts claim_construction
dr._petersons testimony including that concerning lack of motivation to combine and the use of hindsight by ficosas expert constitutes substantial_evidence of nonobviousness whether or not the` clip 28' of claim 1 is limited to a` single_pair of legs'
evidence introduced at trial including dickirson and other references cited by ficosa showed a lack of motivation to combine a serviceable connector with any clip regardless of the presence of a` single_pair of legs'
thus the district_courts claim_construction_error washarmless with respect to the jury finding of nonobviousness
see ecolab 285 f.3d at 1374 62 uspq2d at 1357 ; weinar 744 f.2d at 808 223 uspq at 376

regarding the argument that the required motivation to combine may be found in the nature of the problem ficosas argument is unpersuasive
the showing of a motivation to combine must be clear and particular and it must be supported by actual evidence
in re dembiczak 175_f.3d_994 999 50_uspq2d_1614 1617 fed.cir.1999
ficosa offers no evidence in support of its conclusory assertion that the nature of the problem supplies the necessary motivation to combine much less a clear and particular showing
see id

in addition teleflex presented evidence of commercial_success another basis upon which the jury could have concluded that the invention of claim 1 of the ¡¬ 182 patent was non-obvious
the record shows that ficosa sold a substantial number of accused two-piece cables to gm for the gmt-800_program
in light of the substantial_evidence of non-obviousness in the record we conclude that the district_court properly denied ficosas jmol_motion of obviousness of claim 1 of the ¡¬182_patent

validity of the ¡¬953_patent
ficosa argues that the district_court erred by denying its motion for jmol of invalidity of the ¡¬953_patent
ficosa contends that claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬ 953 patent are anticipated by and/or obvious in view of` spease_exhibit 11' a drawing of a terminal_member that was according to teleflex` a predecessor to the ¡¬953_patent'
ficosa argues that no substantial_evidence appears in the record to support the jurys verdict that the ¡¬953_patent was valid

teleflex argues that ficosa admitted in its brief that spease_exhibit 11 lacks the limitation in claims 1_and_6 that the vibration-dampening member be` totally encapsulated'
teleflex argues that anticipation requires that a single prior_art_reference disclose every limitation of a claim and ficosa conceded that spease_exhibit 11 failed to satisfy this requirement
regarding obviousness teleflex argues that the teachings of the prior_art fail to show the` totally encapsulated' feature described in the ¡¬953_patent and even if they did ficosa failed to show any motivation to combine

ficosa responds by citing in re graves 69_f.3d_1147 36_uspq2d_1697_(fed.cir.1995) for the proposition that a prior_art_reference may anticipate if a skilled artisan could take the references teachings in combination with his own knowledge of the particular art and be in possession of the invention
according to ficosa the prior_art-including another teleflex patent-establishes that one of ordinary_skill would have known how to` totally encapsulate [ ]' according to claims 1_and_6 and therefore *1335 given spease_exhibit 11 would have been in possession of the ¡¬953 invention

again our validity analysis entails a two-step procedure` the first_step involves the proper_interpretation of the claims
the second_step involves determining whether the limitations of the claims as properly interpreted are met by the prior_art'
beachcombers 31 f.3d at 1160 31 uspq2d at 1658
ficosa does not challenge the construction of any claim_term in the ¡¬953_patent but instead challenges the second_step arguing that the limitations of claims 1_and_6 are met by spease_exhibit 11 in combination with the knowledge of one skilled in the art and that therefore the ¡¬953_patent is invalid

to prevail on its motion for jmol ficosa must show that` there is no legally sufficient_evidentiary_basis for a reasonable_jury to find for [ teleflex ] on that issue'

teleflex points to spease_exhibit 11 as substantial_evidence in support of its contention that the ¡¬953_patent is not anticipated
teleflex points to expert testimony and prior_art of record as substantial_evidence in support of its argument that the ¡¬953_patent is not obvious

spease_exhibit 11 fails to show the` totally encapsulated' limitation of claims 1_and_6 as ficosa admits
as we have repeatedly stated anticipation requires that each limitation of a claim must be found in a single reference
see e.g. in re donohue 766_f.2d_531 534 226_uspq_619 621 fed.cir.1985
although we have permitted the use of additional references to confirm the contents of the allegedly anticipating reference see id. we have made clear that anticipation does not permit an additional reference to supply a missing claim limitation

v. dart indus. inc. 726_f.2d_724 727 220_uspq_841 842 fed.cir.1984
ficosas argument attempts to` combine the teachings of the references to build an anticipation'
id
we find ficosas anticipation argument unpersuasive in demonstrating lack of substantial_evidence for the jurys verdict

as for obviousness ficosa fails to carry its burden on appeal
ficosa argues in favor of obviousness on the basis of the examiners statement of reasons for allowance which cited elements present in spease_exhibit 11
ficosa contends that because the prior_art including spease_exhibit 11 discloses the claimed features of claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬953_patent then the jury could not reasonably have found these claims non-obvious
ficosa argues that a suggestion or motivation to combine the references may be supplied by the nature of the problem or the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art
ficosas argument essentially asks us to re-weigh the evidence and substitute our own factual_findings for those of the jury
this we can not do
we find that substantial_evidence supports the jurys conclusion that the ¡¬ 953 patent is not anticipated by or obvious in view of spease_exhibit 11

conclusion
because the district_court correctly granted summary_judgment of no best_mode_violation and substantial_evidence supports the jury_verdicts of infringement and validity of the ¡¬182 and ¡¬953_patent s we affirm the district_courts decision on appeal

affirmed
