i
since 1989 durling has served as a freelance furniture designer in tupelo mississippi
in the spring of 1991 the president of global furniture company global requested that durling prepare a design for a low-cost sectional_sofa group with a corner_table and integral_end_tables
durling conceived of the design shown in the243_patent reproduced below the embodiment of which global sold until it went out of business in the spring of 1992
at that time one of globals customers had sufficient interest in the product that it asked spectrum_furniture_co. inc. spectrum to make furniture embodying the design
spectrum contacted the former president of global and received his approval to supply the product to globals former customer

in august 1992 durling submitted an application for a patent on the furniture design he had provided to global
this application matured into the243_patent which issued in september 1993
shortly thereafter durling sued spectrum for infringement of his patent

at trial spectrum argued that the sole_claim of the243_patent was invalid as obvious in view of several prior_art_designs that were not considered by the examiner
of these several references the district_court emphasized the design of a sectional group manufactured by schweiger furniture industries inc. the schweiger_model reproduced below.1

relying heavily on durlings concession that the schweiger_model is the` closest prior_art to the design thats involved in this case' the district_court found that the differences between the prior_art and the243_patent are insignificant
based on its further finding that durling had not established commercial success related to the patented_design the district_court concluded that the sole_claim of the243_patent is invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994
durling appeals from the district_courts judgment which we review pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1 1994

*103 ii
pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 171 1994 one may obtain a design_patent for` any new original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture'
to obtain such a patent however one must satisfy the patentability requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 1994
in re_borden 90_f.3d_1570 1574 39_uspq2d_1524 1526 fed.cir.1996 ; see 35 u.s.c.¡± 171 1994
in the design_patent_context the ultimate inquiry under section 103 is whether the claimed design would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary_skill who designs articles of the type involved
in re rosen 673_f.2d_388 390 213_uspq_347 349 c.c.p.a.1982
more specifically the inquiry is whether one of ordinary_skill would have combined teachings of the prior_art to create the same_overall_visual_appearance as the claimed design
see in re_borden 90 f.3d at 1574 39 uspq2d at 1526

before one can begin to combine prior_art_designs however one must find a single_reference` a something in existence the design characteristics of which are basically the same as the claimed design'
in re rosen 673 f.2d at 391 213 uspq at 350
once this primary_reference is found other references may be used to modify it to create a design that has the same_overall_visual_appearance as the claimed design
see in re_harvey 12_f.3d_1061 1063 29_uspq2d_1206 1208 fed.cir.1993
these secondary references may only be used to modify the primary_reference if they are` so related [ to the primary_reference ] that the appearance of certain ornamental features in one would suggest the application of those features to the other'
in re_borden 90 f.3d at 1575 39 uspq2d at 1526-27

iii
durling contends that the district_courts invalidity decision is erroneous because no primary_reference exists in the present_case
durling explains that although the prior_art cited by spectrum has the same basic design concept as his claimed design i.e. a sofa_sectional with integrated end_tables each of those prior_art_designs create a different visual_impression than his design
we agree

as explained above the first step in an obviousness analysis for a design_patent requires a search of the prior_art for a primary_reference
this requires the trial_court to 1 discern the correct visual_impression created by the patented_design as a whole ; and 2 determine whether there is a single_reference that creates` basically the same' visual_impression
in comparing the patented_design to a prior_art reference the trial_court judge may determine almost instinctively whether the two designs create basically the same_visual_impression
nonetheless the judge must communicate the reasoning behind the decision
this explanation affords the parties a basis upon which to challenge and also aids the appellate_court in reviewing the judges ultimate decision
cf
lyles v. united states 759_f.2d_941 943-44 d.c.cir.1985 stating that trial_court must provide findings and reasoning to aid appellate_court in understanding the ground or basis of trial_courts decision

in the design_patent_context however the judges explanation of the decision is more complicated because it involves an additional level of abstraction not required when comprehending the matter claimed in a utility patent
unlike the readily available verbal_description of the invention and of the prior_art that exists in a utility patent case a design_patent case presents the judge only with visual_descriptions
given the lack of a visual language the trial_court must first translate these visual_descriptions into words-i.e. into a common medium of communication.2 from this translation the parties and appellate_courts can discern the internal reasoning employed by the trial_court to reach its decision as to whether or not a prior_art_design is basically the same as the claimed design

in the present_case the district_courts opinion demonstrates that it misinterpreted the visual_impression created by durlings claimed design
the district_court described durlings design as follows` the look that the patent-in-suit presented is a sectional_sofa with double rolls of upholstery under the seating area which curve arcuately upward under the end_tables
the end_tables have *104 the appearance of little_vertical_support'
the district_court had earlier defined` vertical_support' to mean` the extent to which the base extends under the end_tables'

based on this verbal_description of durlings claimed design it comes as no surprise that the district_court determined that the prior_art especially the schweiger_model had` looks that are similar to the patent-in-suit'
like durlings design the schweiger_model has integral_end_tables and a continuous front_rail that curves upwardly to support the end_tables
according to the district_court the main difference between durlings design and the schweiger_model is that durlings design has somewhat less vertical_support

the error in the district_courts approach is that it construed durlings claimed design too broadly
the district_courts verbal_description of durlings claimed design does not evoke a visual_image consonant with the claimed design
instead the district_courts description merely represents the general concept of a sectional_sofa with integrated end_tables
as we have explained in the past however the focus in a design_patent obviousness inquiry should be on visual_appearances rather than design_concepts
see in re_harvey 12_f.3d_1061 1064 29_uspq2d_1206 1208 fed.cir.1993
by focusing on the design concept of durlings design rather than its visual_appearance the district_court erred

a proper interpretation of durlings claimed design focuses on the visual_impression it creates
this visual_appearance is that of a contiguous three-piece_sectional_sofa_group containing two sofa_sections at approximately right angles to each other with a triangular_corner_table at their juncture
on the sides away from the corner_table each sofa_section has rounded corners and includes a bolster pillow as an armrest
in addition each sofa_section has a double_front_rail that begins at the end adjacent to the corner_table follows along the bottom of the sofa towards the other end and curves upwardly i.e. sweeps upward through a 90 o angle to truncate at a horizontal_plane upon which the end_table rests

the visual_appearance created by the schweiger_model is that of a three-piece contiguous sofa_sectional group
two linear sofa_sections are placed at approximately right angles to each other as in durlings design
instead of having a triangular_corner_table at their juncture however the schweiger_model contains a third curved sofa_section that lies between the other two sofa_sections
when the three sofa_sections are joined the appearance is that of a rounded right angle
as in durlings design the schweiger_model has rounded ends bolster pillows and a double_front_rail
in the schweiger_model however the double_front_rail curves upward slightly and then curves outward in a horizontal direction to wrap around the end_tables

from these two verbal_descriptions it is readily apparent that the schweiger_model does not create the same_visual_impression as does durlings claimed design
the schweiger_model does not have a corner_table as does durlings design
more significantly the front_rail in the schweiger_model curves upward and then around the end_table
in contrast the front_rail in durlings claimed design simply curves upwardly until it is truncated at a horizontal_plane
if not for the truncating the front_rail in durlings design would continue vertically ; that in the schweiger_model would continue horizontally
because of these significant differences the schweiger_model does not create basically the same_visual_impression as does durlings design and therefore can not suffice as a primary_reference.3

iv
in conclusion the district_courts verbal_description reveals that it improperly interpreted *105 durlings claimed design in terms of design_concepts rather than its visual_appearance as a whole
the record contains no prior_art_design that creates basically the same_visual_impression as does durlings claimed design
no primary_reference has been shown to exist
without such a primary_reference it is improper to invalidate a design_patent on grounds of obviousness
the judgment of the district_court must be
reversed

in its opinion the district_court also mentions the gentry_model and a sectional_sofa group manufactured by gaines manufacturing company the gaines_model
the only apparent difference between the gaines and schweiger_models is that the end_tables in the gaines_model are separate from the sofa whereas those in schweiger are integrated
the appearance of the two however is essentially identical
because the obviousness inquiry focuses upon appearance and not functional considerations the gaines_model is cumulative to schweiger and accordingly we will refer only to the schweiger_model
2
when properly done this verbal_description should evoke the visual_image of the design
3
similarly the gentry_model does not create basically the same_visual_impression as durlings design
the gentry_model appears to consist of a single linear sofa unlike the multiple-component right-angled design of durling
moreover the front_rail in the gentry_model barely curves upward and provides almost total vertical_support for the end_table
the gentry_model therefore does not duplicate durlings design of an upward sweeping front_rail having very little_vertical_support
