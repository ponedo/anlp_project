i
background
a
the technology
sevoflurane is a fast-acting highly effective inhalation anesthetic
however pure sevoflurane has a serious problem unknown at the time of its invention and original shipment it degrades in the presence of lewis_acids
lewis_acids are essentially defined as any species with an empty electron orbit leading to electron affinity and are common enough that avoiding exposure of sevoflurane to lewis_acids is quite difficult
among the products of the degradation_reaction is hydrofluoric_acid which is highly dangerous if inhaled
¡¬176_patent col.1 ll.52-57
the original containers in which abbott shipped its product had lewis_acids exposed on their interiors
the hydrofluoric_acid thus produced etched the containers glass surfaces exposing even more lewis_acids resulting in a vicious-cycle cascading reaction that seriously compromised abbotts product while on the shelf and forced a recall

after investigating the cause of the degradation abbott discovered the source of the problem
it also found a solution water mixed in with sevoflurane will bind to and deactivate lewis_acids protecting the sevoflurane from the degradation_reaction
a deliberate addition of water to sevoflurane ran counter to the conventional wisdom at the time previously abbott had sought to minimize its products water_content
abbott filed a patent application on the degradation-preventing combination of water or other` lewis_acid_inhibitors' with sevoflurane which issued as the ¡¬176_patent at issue here

b
prior proceedings
baxter sought to ship its own_sevoflurane_product
on january 26 2001 it filed an amended abbreviated new drug application` anda' with the food and drug administration` fda' covering its own_sevoflurane_product
baxter filed with the fda a certification of noninfringement and invalidity of the ¡¬ 176 patent pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv commonly known as a` paragraph iv certification' which created the cause of action giving rise to this suit under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2

there are multiple product and method_claims at issue
claim 1 of the ¡¬ 176 patent is representative an anesthetic composition comprising a quantity of sevoflurane ; and a lewis_acid_inhibitor in an amount effective to prevent degradation by a lewis acid of said quantity of sevoflurane said lewis_acid_inhibitor selected from the group consisting of water butylated hydroxytoluene methylparaben propylparaben propofol and thymol
'176_patent col. 11 ll.21-29
the other claims at issue speak to using water specifically methods of combining sevoflurane and lewis_acid_inhibitors to produce the *1366 above-mentioned composition or both
id.at cols.11-12

this case came before us for the first time when we reviewed the district_courts construction of the phrase` amount effective to prevent degradation' to require at least 131 parts per million` ppm' of water and its consequent summary_judgment of noninfringement
abbott 334 f.3d at 1277
we disagreed with that construction noting that` an effective amount of any given lewis_acid_inhibitor will vary according to the conditions to which sevoflurane is subjected' making construction referencing particular ranges of water_content inappropriate
id.at 1278
we vacated the district_courts summary_judgment and remanded
id.at 1283
on remand the district_court conducted a bench_trial
it determined that the term` to prevent degradation' had been left unconstrued abbott no._01-_cv-1867 slip op.at 7 and concluded that` sevoflurane is degraded if it contains degradants in amounts greater than 300 ppm'
id.at 16
it found abbotts literal infringement evidence to be unpersuasive id.at 27 and abbotts doctrine of equivalents argument to be barred by prosecution history estoppel id.at 31
it addressed baxters claim that the patent was unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct but declined to so hold
id.at 48

baxter made two distinct invalidity arguments
it first argued that since some lots of the pre-recall sevoflurane sold by abbott had not degraded there had been a prior_sale which would bar the patent
the district_court found insufficient evidence that those lots had actually been exposed to lewis_acids making a finding that they had contained water` in an amount effective to prevent degradation' unsupportable
id.at 44
baxters second argument was that the ¡¬211_patent disclosed a composition of water-saturated sevoflurane that met all the limitations of the asserted_claims
id.at 37-39
the district_court noted some of our holdings finding anticipation even where as here there was no knowledge at the time of the relevant_properties of the prior_art
id.at 40-41 citing atlas powder co. v. ireco inc. 190_f.3d_1342 1348-49 fed.cir.1999 ; smithkline beecham corp. v. apotex corp. 403_f.3d_1331 1343-44 fed.cir.2005 ; schering corp. v. geneva pharms. inc. 339_f.3d_1373 1378-80 fed.cir.2003
however it concluded that the ¡¬211_patent did not anticipate
id.at 43
that decision was based on its reading of our decision in bristol-myers_squibb co. v. ben venue labs. inc. in which we noted that` [ n ] ewly discovered results of known processes directed to the same_purpose are not patentable because such results are inherent'
id.at 42 quoting 246_f.3d_1368 1376 fed.cir.2001 emphasis added by district_court
it concluded that since the ¡¬211_patent disclosed an` intermediate_step' in the manufacture of sevoflurane` the patents purpose was not to produce sevoflurane in its final useable form' in distinction to the purpose of the ¡¬176_patent which` involves a final step in production'
id.at 42
the district_court reasoned that since the patents purposes were different the bristol-myers_squibb distinction foreclosed a finding of anticipation
id.at 42-43

all of these rulings by the district_court are before us via either abbotts appeal or baxters cross-appeal
abbott challenges the claim_construction arguing that the intrinsic evidence of the ¡¬176_patent permits more than 4,000 ppm of impurities before the sevoflurane may be considered` degraded'
abbott also challenges the district_courts findings on literal and doctrine of equivalents infringement
baxter challenges enforceability and validity the latter in light of both the ¡¬211_patent and *1367 the alleged prior_sale
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
a
standard of review
patent claims are presumed to be valid 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 and the party seeking to show invalidity must prove facts supporting invalidity by clear and convincing evidence
n. am vaccine inc. v. am
cyanamid co. 7_f.3d_1571 1579 fed.cir.1993
since this case comes to us from a trial without jury we review the district_courts findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo
panduit corp. v. dennison mfg co. 810_f.2d_1561 1565 fed.cir.1987

b
the ¡¬211_patent
the ¡¬211_patent was applied for in 1995 and awarded to kawai et al
in november 1997
appellant central glass co. is the assignee
the parties do not dispute that the ¡¬211_patent predates the ¡¬176_patent for the purposes of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 and the facts about what the ¡¬211_patent teaches are in relevant part undisputed
it discloses a technique for purifying sevoflurane for` use [ ] as a pharmaceutical and particularly as an inhalation anesthetic' ¡¬211_patent abstract which involves the addition of water
if the steps of its illustration 1 table 2 are practiced the result will be sevoflurane that is saturated with water unable to absorb any more moisture
saturation implies that the sevoflurane contains an amount of water sufficient to prevent it from degrading due to lewis_acids

at the time however knowledge of the beneficial nature of a water-sevoflurane mix was wholly lacking in the art
the district_court describes the matter succinctly [ p ] rior to [ the ¡¬176_patent ] invention no one had any idea that lewis_acids had the potential to degrade sevoflurane
further no one was aware of the stabilizing effect water would have to prevent lewis_acid_degradation
in fact water was considered an impurity and was removed from sevoflurane to the extent possible during the manufacturing process that included the teachings of the ¡¬211_patent
abbott no._01-_cv-1867 slip op.at 39 2005_wl_2347221
thus the ¡¬ 211 patent discloses a particular composition and claims a process for making that composition but does not teach the advantageous feature of that composition whose discovery led to the patent in suit

c. unknown properties and anticipation
our cases have consistently held that a reference may anticipate even when the relevant_properties of the thing disclosed were not appreciated at the time
the classic case on this point is titanium_metals corp. v. banner 778_f.2d_775_(fed.cir.1985)
in titanium_metals the applicants sought patent_protection on an alloy with previously unknown corrosion resistance and workability properties
id.at 776
the prior_art_reference was an article by two russian scientists that disclosed in a few data points on its graphs an alloy falling within the scope of the claims of the patent in suit
id.at 776-77
there was no sign that the russian authors or anyone else had understood the later-discovered features of the alloy thus described
id.at 780-81
despite the fact that` the applicants for patent had discovered or invented and disclosed knowledge which is not to be found in the reference' we held that the russian article anticipated the asserted patent claims
id.at 782
the titanium_metals rule has been repeatedly confirmed and applied by this court
see e.g. *1368 in re crish 393_f.3d_1253 1258-59 fed.cir.2004 citing cases ; holding asserted_claims covering a genes nucleotide sequence anticipated where the gene though not its particular sequence was already known to the art ; in re cruciferous sprout litig. 301_f.3d_1343 1349-50 fed.cir.2002 inventors recognition of substances that render broccoli and cauliflower particularly healthy does not permit patent on identifying broccoli seeds or preparing broccoli as a food product ; atlas powder 190 f.3d at 1347-1350 holding asserted_claims covering air mixed into an explosive composition anticipated by prior_art that necessarily also contained air as claimed even though benefits of the air were not recognized
indeed the rule did not originate with titanium_metals
see ansonia brass & copper co. v. elec
supply co. 144_u.s._11 18 12_s.ct._601 36_l.ed._327_(1892)` [ t ] he application of an old process or machine to a similar or analogous subject with no change in the manner of application and no result substantially distinct in its nature will not sustain a patent even if the new form of result had not before been contemplated
`` ; in re pearson 494_f.2d_1399 1403 c.c.p.a.1974 inventors recognition that prior-art compound inhibited defects in peanut plants did not suffice to grant patent_protection on that compound ; in re benner 36_c.c.p.a._1081 174_f.2d_938 942 1949` [ n ] o provision has been made in the patent statutes for granting a patent upon an old product based solely upon discovery of a new_use for such product
``

the general principle that a newly-discovered property of the prior_art can not support a patent on that same art is not avoided if the patentee explicitly claims that property
`` [ a ] prior_art_reference may anticipate without disclosing a feature of the claimed invention if that missing characteristic is necessarily present or inherent in the single anticipating reference'
schering 339 f.3d at 1377 citing continental can co. v. monsanto co. 948_f.2d_1264 1268 fed.cir.1991
`` [ i ] nherent anticipation does not require that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time would have recognized the inherent disclosure'
id
( citing cruciferous sprout 301 f.3d at 1351

abbotts objection here is merely that at the time of the ¡¬211_patent nobody knew that the water-saturated sevoflurane that patent disclosed had the property of resisting the lewis_acid_degradation_reaction
just as in titanium_metals that lack of knowledge is wholly irrelevant to the question of whether the ¡¬176_patent claims something` new' over the disclosure of the ¡¬211_patent ; the claimed property of resistance to degradation is found inherently in the disclosure
since the ¡¬211_patent discloses sevoflurane saturated with water-i.e. unable to absorb any additional water to further protect it from the degradation_reaction-it anticipates the claims of the ¡¬176_patent
this is true under any definition of the term` prevent degradation' that the claims might reasonably bear so we need not construe that phrase with numerical exactitude in order to reach our decision

the district_court nonetheless found the patent valid due to the purpose-based distinction we drew in bristol-myers_squibb
abbott no._01-_cv-1867 slip op.at 42-43 citing 246 f.3d at 1376
as a threshold matter we note that that distinction is applicable only to process claims
bristol-myers_squibb states that` new_uses of known processes may be patentable' citing in support the definition of` process' found at 35 u.s.c.¡± 100 b
246 f.3d at 1376
the case does not speak to composition claims ; the district_court therefore committed legal error by applying it to sustain the validity of those claims of the ¡¬176_patent that cover a mixture of sevoflurane *1369 and water
as to the ¡¬176_patents process claims we agree that bristol-myers_squibb needs to be considered but we disagree with the concept that the processes described in the ¡¬176_patent are not` directed to the same_purpose' id. under the meaning of bristol-myers_squibb
both the ¡¬211 and the ¡¬176_patent s disclose methods which help to ensure that sevoflurane will be of high purity at the time it is administered to patients
the ¡¬211_patent discloses a method of achieving that end by adding water and then distilling the solution which results in removing impurities from the sevoflurane while the ¡¬176_patent accomplishes the same objective by merely adding water which results in safeguarding the sevoflurane against impurities generated by the presence of lewis_acids
all of the steps of the ¡¬176_patent are thus disclosed in the ¡¬211_patent in furtherance of the same_purpose the delivery of safe effective sevoflurane anesthetic
all that is contributed by the method_claims of the ¡¬176_patent is the recognition of a new property of the prior_art_process
we hold today as we did in bristol-myers_squibb that` the claimed process here is not directed to a new_use ; it is the same use'
id
; see also catalina mktg int l inc. v. coolsavings.com inc. 289_f.3d_801 809-10 fed.cir.2002 explaining that an inventor may not obtain a patent on a process having the same steps as a prior_art_process in which the new process merely identifies a new advantageous property of the prior_art_process

we also do not find it material that the district_court found the anticipating method in the ¡¬211_patent to be` an intermediate_step' in the manufacture of sevoflurane
abbott no._01-_cv-1867 slip op.at 42
the product of that method was an anesthetic_sevoflurane_composition with sufficient water to prevent lewis_acid_degradation-exactly what is claimed by the ¡¬176_patent
commercial finality is not claimed

iii
conclusion
for the reasons given above we reverse the district_courts judgment that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬176_patent are valid
since all asserted_claims are invalid we do not reach questions of infringement or inequitable_conduct

reversed
