opinion
gajarsa circuit_judge
king_pharmaceuticals inc. and king_pharmaceuticals_research and development inc.` king' appeal the u.s. district court for the eastern_district of new_yorks grant of eon_labs inc.s` eon' motion for summary_judgment that all claims of u.s. patent nos._6407,128 the` ¡¬128_patent` and 6,683,102 the` ¡¬102_patent` are invalid
see king_pharms. inc. v. eon_labs inc. 593_f.supp.2d_501 e.d.n.y.2009
in granting eons motion the district_court held four claims invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 101 three claims invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 and the remaining claims invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
see id.at 506-15

*1270 following the summary_judgment order the district_court entered a final_judgment against both king and elan_pharmaceuticals inc.` elan' a prior owner of one of the asserted patents and a third-party counterclaim_defendant
elan filed a` cautionary' notice of appeal on july_2,_2009 contending that the district_court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final_judgment against it
elan then moved to be dismissed as a party from this appeal for lack of subject_matter_jurisdiction and to vacate the district_courts judgment as to elan
a federal circuit motions panel denied the motion because the jurisdictional facts went to the merits of the case
elan reasserts its jurisdictional arguments in the present appeal

for the reasons stated below we affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment of invalidity
we vacate the district_courts invalidity_order against elan because the district_court lacked subject_matter_jurisdiction to adjudicate the invalidity counterclaim

background
king markets and sells a name brand version of metaxalone called skelaxin
metaxalone is a muscle relaxant that is used to treat` discomforts associated with acute painful musculosketal_conditions'
¡¬128_patent col.1 ll.21-23
metaxalone was first discovered in the 1960s and the first patent claiming the method of producing the compound u.s. patent no._3062,827 issued in 1962 to a.h. robins company inc. a.h. robins began selling metaxalone under the brand name skelaxin in 1962
elan eventually acquired the rights to skelaxin and sold those rights in 2003 to king which now markets and sells skelaxin

on august 31 2004 eon filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' for a generic 800 mg_metaxalone_tablet
eon filed with the anda a patent certification pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv` paragraph_iv_certification' which alleged that none of the claims of the ¡¬128_patent would be infringed by the manufacture use or sale of eons generic 800 mg_metaxalone_tablet and that all the claims of the ¡¬128_patent are invalid
in response to the anda and paragraph_iv_certification king filed suit against eon under the hatch-waxman act the` 800 mg_action'
the complaint accused eon of infringing the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s. kings action was consolidated with an earlier related action elan_pharmaceuticals inc. v. eon_labs inc. no._03-0006 e.d.n.y
( the` 400 mg_action' that elan filed in 2001 against eon after eon filed an anda for a generic 400 mg_metaxalone_tablet
elan asserted the ¡¬128_patent in the 400 mg_action but the case was dismissed after eon withdrew its 400 mg anda
the district_court then severed eons claims for attorneys_fees against king and elan and consolidated those claims with the 800 mg_action

the ¡¬128_patent titled` method for increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone' issued on june_18,_2002 and was initially assigned to elan
elan subsequently assigned the ¡¬128_patent to king in 2003
the patent discloses a method of` increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone by administration of an oral_dosage_form with food'
¡¬128_patent [ abstract ]
the claimed invention is the result of` the unexpected finding that administration of metaxalone with food increases both the rate and extent of absorption via the oral_dosage_form in human subjects'
id.at col.2 ll.6-9

the ¡¬128_patent has three independent_claims claims 1 9 and 17
claim 1 claims` a method of increasing the oral_bioavailability of metaxalone' by` administering to the patient a therapeutically effective_amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical_composition with food'
claim 9 claims a *1271 method for increasing` the rate and extent of absorption.. of metaxalone.. in the blood stream' by` administering to the patient a therapeutically effective_amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical_composition with food'
claim 17 claims a method similar to claim 1 but limits the effective_amount of metaxalone to between 400_and_800 mg and defines an increase in bioavailability as` an increase in the maximal_plasma_concentration cmax and extent of absorption auc last of metaxalone compared to administration without food'

dependent_claims 2 3 10 and 11 specify that the` therapeutically effective_amount' of metaxalone is` 200 mg to 900 mg' claims 2_and_10 or` 400 mg to 800 mg' claims 3_and_11
dependent_claims 4-6 12-14 and 18-20 specify specific times for administering the metaxalone relative to the consumption of food either thirty minutes prior to two hours after consumption of food claims 4 12_and_18` substantially at the same_time' as consumption of food claims 5 13_and_19 or up to one hour after consumption of food claims 6 14_and_20
dependent_claims 7_and_15 limit the dosage to a tablet_form and dependent_claims 8_and_16 limit the dosage to a` unit_dosage_form'
dependent claim 21 claims the method of claim 1 with the additional_limitation of` informing' the patient that taking metaxalone with food will increase the drugs bioavailability and dependent_claim 22 claims the method of claim 1 with the additional_limitation that` the metaxalone is from a container with printed labeling advising' that taking metaxalone with food will increase the drugs bioavailability

the ¡¬102_patent issued on january 27 2004 and is titled` methods of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions'
elan assigned the application that resulted in the ¡¬102_patent to king in 2003
like the ¡¬ 128 patent the ¡¬102_patent discloses a method of` increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone by administration of an oral_dosage_form with food'
¡¬102_patent [ abstract ]
independent_claim 1 claims a method for using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal_conditions comprising both` providing' a patient with a` therapeutically effective_amount of metaxalone' and` informing' the patient that taking metaxalone with food increases the bioavailability of the drug
claims 2_through_5 depend from claim 1 and either specify the` therapeutically effective_amount' as 200 mg to 900 mg claim 2 or 400 mg to 800 mg claim 3 or limit the dosage to a tablet_form claim 4 or a` unit_dosage_form' claim 5

independent_claim 6 claims a` method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal_conditions' consisting of` informing a patient' that taking metaxalone with food increases the bioavailability of the drug compared to taking metaxalone without food
independent_claim 7 claims a` method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal_conditions' by` obtaining metaxalone from a container providing information that administration of metaxalone with food' increases the drugs bioavailability and` ingesting the metaxalone with food'

independent_claim 8 claims a` method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal_conditions' comprising both administering metaxalone with food and informing the patient that such administration increases the bioavailability of the drug
dependent_claims 9_through_11 limit claim 8 to metaxalone from a container with printed information concerning the increased bioavailability of the drug claim 9 metaxalone in a tablet_form claim 10 and 400 mg of metaxalone claim 11
claims 12 13 and 14 depend from claim 9 and limit the printed label to stating certain_percentage_increases in the *1272 bioavailability of metaxalone
finally claim 15 depends from claim 8 and limits the metaxalone to a 400 mg_tablet with a printed label that states certain_percentage_increases in the bioavailability of the metaxalone

before the district_court eon presented six prior_art_references it contended invalidated the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s. see king_pharms. inc. 593 f.supp.2d at 504-06
in granting eons motion for summary_judgment the district_court relied only upon three references kazem fathie musculoskeletal disorders and their management with a new relaxant clinical medicine 678 april 1965` fathie_ii' ; joseph a. albanese nurses drug reference 427 2_ed._1982` albanese' ; and anne c. abrams clinical drug therapy 145 1995` abrams'
see id.at 506-15

fathie_ii describes a clinical study in which patients were given 800 mg of metaxalone to be taken three to five times a day
the article notes that several patients complained of nausea and that` [ n ] ausea might have been less prominent if the medication had been taken with food'
j.a.3054

albanese is a reference_guide for registered nurses
the guide discloses that metaxalone is available in 400 mg_tablets and recommends a dosage range of 800 mg three to four times daily
the guide also notes that` [ a ] dministration with meals will help reduce gastric_upset'
j.a.3065

abrams is another reference_guide for registered nurses
the reference_guide discloses providing patients with 800 mg of metaxalone three or four times daily for not more than ten consecutive days
the reference_guide also instructs nurses to give metaxalone` with milk or food' in order to` decrease gastrointestinal_distress'
j.a.3072

eon moved for summary_judgment of invalidity
eons motion asserted that all claims of the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s were either anticipated by or obvious in light of the prior_art
the district_court granted eons motion
see king_pharms. inc. 593_f.supp.2d_501

starting with independent_claim 1 of the ¡¬128_patent the district_court found the claims preamble-' [ a ] method of increasing the oral_bioavailability of metaxalone to a patient receiving metaxalone_therapy' -inherently anticipated because` an increase in the bioavailability of metaxalone is inherent when the drug is taken with food'
id.at 508
the district_court then concluded that` because the ¡¬128_patent teaches nothing more than administering metaxalone with food to increase its bioavailability and because fathie_ii albanese and abrams all teach administering metaxalone with food-which inherently increases metaxalones bioavailability-claim 1 is anticipated'
id.at 509

turning to the ¡¬128_patents dependent_claims the district_court found claims 2_and_3 anticipated because the prior_art_references disclosed dosage amounts within the claimed` therapeutically effective' range
see id.at 510
claims 4_through_7 were also found anticipated because the prior_art disclosed taking metaxalone with food within the various time_frames claimed
see id
as for claim 8 the district_court found that no reference disclosed taking a single tablet of metaxalone with food but held the claim obvious in light of a prior_art_reference 18 r.w
dent jr. and dorothy k. ervin a study of metaxalone skelaxin vs
placebo in acute musculoskeletal disorders a cooperative study current therapeutic research 1975` dent' which discloses a single tablet dosage and albanese which discloses taking dosages with food
see id.at 510-11

the district_court then found claims 9_through_16 mirrored claims 1_through_7 *1273 and found the claims anticipated for the earlier stated reasons
see id.at 512
claim 17 was also found anticipated because the claims` wherein the administration [ of metaxalone ] results in an increase in [ bioavailability ]' language like claim 1s preamble is an inherent_property of the prior_art
see id
claims 18_through_20 which depend from claim 17 include the same timing limitations as claims 4_through_6 and were anticipated for the same_reasons
see id
the district_court then found claim 21 invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 101 because the claims` informing' limitation did not` transform the metaxalone into a different_state or thing'
id.at 513 citing in re_bilski 545_f.3d_943_(fed.cir.2008) affd sub nom bilski v. kappos -- - u.s. -- -- 130_s.ct._3218 177_l.ed.2d_792_(2010)
finally the district_court held claim 22 anticipated because the inclusion of an instruction sheet with a known compound did not make the claim patentably distinct from the prior_art
see id
( citing in re ngai 367_f.3d_1336_(fed.cir.2004) per curiam

the district_court next addressed the ¡¬102_patent reading claim 1 to` require [ ] giving a patient metaxalone and informing the patient about an inherent_property of the drug'
id.at 514 alteration added
in analyzing claim 1 the district_court held that administering metaxalone to a patient was disclosed in the prior_art the` informing' limitation was not patentable for the same_reasons as claim 21 of the ¡¬128_patent and the entire claim was invalid under ¡± 101
see id
claims 2_through_4 contained dosage limitations similar to the limitations disclosed in anticipated claims 2 3 and 7 of the ¡¬128_patent and the district_court found the claims to be similarly anticipated under ¡± 102
see id
claim 5 was similar to claim 8 of the ¡¬128_patent and was obvious for the same_reasons
see id

the district_court found claim 6 claimed solely the` informing' limitation and invalidated it under ¡± 101.1 see id
the district_court then found claims 7_and_9 invalid for the same_reasons as claim 22 of the ¡¬128_patent and claim 8 invalid for the same_reasons as claim 21 of the ¡¬128_patent
see id.at 514-15
claims 10_and_11 were found invalid for the same_reasons as claim 7 of the ¡¬128_patent
see id.at 515
finally claims 12_through_15 which` differ from the prior_art only in the content of the written material that accompanies the metaxalone' were like claim 22 of the ¡¬128_patent anticipated because` a variation in written material that is not functionally related to the invention does not render a known product patentable'
id

in light of its invalidity determination the district_court granted kings motion to dismiss eons counterclaims for fraud and unclean_hands as moot
see id.at 516
the district_court however permitted eon to brief its argument that the case was exceptional under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
see id.at 515
the district_court then entered its invalidity judgment against not only king but also elan which had not participated in the summary_judgment proceeding

b
analysis
the district_court considered and invalidated all thirty-seven claims of the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s and king appeals thirty-six of those findings
we begin as the district_court did with the ¡¬128_patent and then turn to the ¡¬102_patent

i
the ¡¬128_patent
a
claim 1
claim 1 is an independent_claim requiring the administration of` a therapeutically effective_amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical_composition with food'
claim 1 contains a preamble which king argues is the claims source of novelty
the preamble reads` [ a ] method of increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone to a patient receiving metaxalone_therapy'
according to king while the prior_art may disclose taking metaxalone with food it does not disclose increasing the bioavailability of the drug

in its summary_judgment opinion the district_court rejected kings argument and found claim 1s preamble inherently anticipated
see king_pharms. inc. 593 f.supp.2d at 507-09
according to the district_court an increase in the bioavailability of metaxalone is an inherent_property of taking metaxalone with food which is disclosed in each of fathie_ii albanese and abrams
see id

on appeal king argues the district_court erred because eon did not provide any evidence or expert testimony that the prior_art would necessarily result in an increase in metaxalones bioavailability
king argues that the prior_arts disclosure taking metaxalone with food to reduce gastric discomfort is vague as to the conditions under which the food was administered such that it was improper for the district_court to assume that an increase in bioavailability was necessarily disclosed
specifically king contrasts the precise conditions on food_consumption disclosed in the ¡¬128_patent with the vague conditions disclosed in fathie_ii albanese and abrams.2 for further support king cites *1275 its own expert reports which conclude that` even a disclosure of taking metaxalone with food would not inherently disclose increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone'

as an initial matter kings attempt to link an increase in metaxalones bioavailability to specific_food_conditions is untenable
while the ¡¬128_patents written description discloses specific conditions for food_consumption its claims only recite taking metaxalone` with food'
it would be improper to limit the broad_terms used in the ¡¬128_patents claims to the specific_food_conditions disclosed in the written description
see kara tech inc. v. stamps.com inc. 582_f.3d_1341 1348 fed.cir.2009` the claims not specification embodiments define the scope of patent protection
the patentee is entitled to the full scope of his claims and we will not limit him to his preferred embodiment or import a limitation from the specification into the claims`
moreover the written description in no way suggests that the specific_food_conditions disclosed were necessary for increasing metaxalones bioavailability
rather the written description teaches that the claimed increase in metaxalones bioavailability can be achieved through the consumption of` a meal such as breakfast lunch or dinner'
¡¬128_patent col.2 ll.37-38
the district_court was therefore correct in finding that` the ¡¬ 128 patent does not identify any additional conditions that must be present for the food_effect to occur
rather it occurs naturally in most people when they take metaxalone with food'
king_pharms. inc. 593 f.supp.2d at 508 ; see also verdegaal bros. inc. v. union oil co. of california 814_f.2d_628 632 fed.cir.1987 holding reliance on non-claimed distinction between prior_art method and claimed method` inappropriate' and insufficient to save the claim from inherent_anticipation

as for the merits of kings argument we first note that fathie_ii albanese and abrams each disclose administering metaxalone` with food' or` with meals' to treat musculoskeletal_conditions
fathie_ii published thirty-six years prior to the filing of the ¡¬128_patent teaches administering metaxalone` with food' to reduce nausea
j.a.3054
albanese published nineteen years prior to the filing of the ¡¬128_patent teaches administering metaxalone` with meals' to` reduce gastric_upset'
j.a.3065
and abrams published six years prior to the filing of the ¡¬128_patent teaches administering metaxalone` with milk or food' to` decrease gastrointestinal_distress'
j.a.3072

we have held that` [ i ] t is a general rule that merely discovering and claiming a new benefit of an old process can not render the process again patentable'
in re woodruff 919_f.2d_1575 1578 fed.cir.1990
such newly discovered benefits are not patentable because they are inherent in the prior_art
see bristol-myers squibb co. v. ben venue labs. inc. 246_f.3d_1368 1376 fed.cir.2001
while inherent_anticipation` may not be established by probabilities or possibilities' in re oelrich 666_f.2d_578 581 ccpa 1981 if` the [ prior_arts ] disclosure is sufficient to show that the natural_result flowing from the operation as taught would result in the performance of the questioned function it seems to be well-settled that the disclosure should be regarded as sufficient' id
( alterations added

according to the ¡¬128_patent the natural_result of taking metaxalone with food is an increase in the bioavailability of the drug
the prior_art discloses taking metaxalone with food but not the natural_result of this process
however because the prior_art methods in their` normal and usual operation.. perform the function which [ king ] claims in [ the ¡¬128_patent ] then such [ patent ] *1276 will be considered to have been anticipated by the [ prior_art ]'
in re ackenbach 18_c.c.p.a._769 45_f.2d_437 439 1930 alterations added
as taught by the ¡¬128_patent the only steps required to increase metaxalones bioavailability are 1 ingesting metaxalone 2 with food
these steps are undeniably disclosed by the prior_art
an increase in metaxalones bioavailability is therefore an inherent aspect of the prior_art
in other_words the increase in metaxalones bioavailability is the`natural_result flowing from the [ prior_arts ] explicitly explicated limitations'
eli lilly & co. v. barr labs. inc. 251_f.3d_955 970 fed.cir.2001 alterations added ; see also mehl/biophile int l_corp. v. milgraum 192_f.3d_1362 1366 fed.cir.1999` [ t ] o the extent the embodiment in the patent achieves [ the limitation ] so does the [ prior_art ]'
( alterations added
accordingly claim 1s preamble is inherently anticipated

kings experts opinions that` even a disclosure of taking metaxalone with food would not inherently disclose increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone' do not undermine our analysis
to anticipate the prior_art need only meet the inherently disclosed limitation to the extent the patented method does
see hewlett-packard co. v. mustek systems inc. 340_f.3d_1314 1326 fed.cir.2003` [ a ] prior_art product that sometimes but not always embodies a claimed method nonetheless teaches that aspect of the invention`
because the ¡¬128_patent discloses no more than taking metaxalone with food to the extent such a method increases the bioavailability of metaxalone the identical prior_art method does as well
as the district_court aptly stated` to inherently anticipate the prior_art need only give the same results as the patent not better'
king_pharms. inc. 593 f.supp.2d at 509

for the foregoing reasons the district_courts inherent_anticipation analysis was proper
the preamble to claim 1 is inherently anticipated
to hold otherwise would remove from the public a method of treating muscle pain that has been performed for decades
see atlas powder co. v. ireco inc. 190_f.3d_1342 1348 fed.cir.1999` the public remains free to make use or sell prior_art compositions or processes regardless of whether or not they understand their complete makeup or the underlying scientific principles which allow them to operate
the doctrine of anticipation by inherency among other doctrines enforces that basic principle`
accordingly the district_courts finding that claim 1 is anticipated is affirmed

because we reject kings argument that claim 1s preamble is novel we also affirm the district_courts findings of invalidity as to claims 2 3 8-11 and 15-17
for these claims kings sole argument on appeal was that their incorporation of claim 1s preamble claims 2 3 7 and 8 or their recitation of a similar preamble claims 9-big_token__11_and_15__big_token -17 made the claims novel
like claim 1 these claims are anticipated because their sole_source of novelty is inherently disclosed by the prior_art

b
claims 4-6 12-14 and 18-20
claims 4-6 depend from claim 1
the claims limit the time_frame in which the patient must ingest the metaxalone in relation to consuming food
claim 4 limits the time_frame to` 30 minutes prior to 2 hours after consumption of the food' claim 5 limits it to` substantially at the same_time' and claim 6 limits it to` immediately after the consumption of food up to 1 hour after'
fathie_ii albanese and abrams respectively disclose administering metaxalone` with food'` with meals' and` with food or milk'
j.a.3054 3065 3072

on appeal king argues that none of the claims specific timeframe requirements is disclosed in fathie_ii albanese or *1277 abrams
yet according to kings own experts` with food' could mean taking metaxalone` 1 hour prior to up to about 2 hours after eating'
j.a.3221 decl
of dr. elia
under this common-sense definition of` with food' the prior_art discloses a timeframe for ingesting metaxalone in relation to consuming food that falls within the timeframes claimed by claims 4-6
the district_courts finding that claims 4-6 are anticipated is therefore affirmed
see titanium metals corp. of america v. banner 778_f.2d_775 782 fed.cir.1985` [ it is ] an elementary principle of patent law that when as by a recitation of ranges or otherwise a claim covers several compositions the claim isanticipated if one of them is in the prior_art
`` ; fresenius usa inc. v. baxter int l inc. 582_f.3d_1288 1298 fed.cir.2009

claims 12-big_token__14_and_18__big_token -20 contain identical timeframe requirements
the district_court invalidated these claims for the same_reasons it invalidated claims 4-6
we therefore affirm the district_courts invalidation of these claims for the same_reasons we affirmed its invalidation of claims 4-6

c. claim 21
claim 21 depends from claim 1 and adds the limitation` informing the patient that administration of a therapeutically effective_amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical_composition with food_results in an increase in the maximal_plasma_concentration cmax and extent of absorption auc last of metaxalone compared to administration without food'
the district_court invalidated claim 21 pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 101
in invalidating claim 21 the district_court cited this courts opinion in in re_bilski and held that` the act of informing another person of the food_effect of metaxalone does not transform metaxalone into a different_state or thing'
king_pharms. inc. 593 f.supp.2d at 513

on appeal king contends it was legal_error for the district_court to focus solely on the` informing' limitation in invalidating the claim
instead according to king the district_court should have examined the claim as a whole to determine whether it recited patent eligible subject_matter
king is correct

the supreme_court has stated that a ¡± 101 patentability analysis is directed to the claim as a whole not individual limitations
see parker v. flook 437_u.s._584 590 98_s.ct._2522 57_l.ed.2d_451_(1978)` [ a ] process is not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical algorithm'
( alterations added ; see also in re_bilski 545 f.3d at 958` [ t ] he [ supreme ] court has made clear that it is inappropriate to determine the patent-eligibility of a claim as a whole based on whether selected limitations constitute patent-eligible subject_matter'
( alterations added
contrary to the supreme_courts instructions the district_court ignored the claim as a whole and improperly focused on one limitation the` informing' limitation in invalidating the claim under ¡± 101
such an analysis is improper

reviewed as a whole claim 21 teaches a method of treating patients with metaxalone whereby the patient is administered metaxalone with food and informed that such treatment increases the bioavailability of the drug
prior to the supreme_courts decision in bilski this court held that such medical treatment methods were patentable processes under ¡± 101 because they fell squarely within the machine-or-transformation_test applied in in re_bilski
specifically we held that methods of treatment` are always transformative when a defined group of drugs is administered to the body to ameliorate the effects of an undesired condition' because such methods transform the human body
prometheus *1278 labs. inc. v. mayo collaborative serv. 581_f.3d_1336 1346 fed.cir.2009 cert
granted and vacated -- - u.s. -- -- 130_s.ct._3543 177_l.ed.2d_1120_(2010)
while the supreme_court in bilski made clear that our machine-or-transformation_test is not the exclusive_test for patentability bilski 130 s.ct.at 3226-27 it also made clear that the test` is a useful and important clue an investigative tool for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under ¡± 101' id.at 3227
we therefore understand the supreme_court to have rejected the exclusive nature of our test but not necessarily the wisdom behind it

the present case however does not present the proper vehicle for determining whether claims covering medical treatment methods are eligible for patenting under ¡± 101 because even if claim 21 recites patent eligible subject_matter that subject_matter is anticipated for the reasons discussed below
as an appellate court we are not limited to a district_courts stated reasons for invalidating claims and can affirm a grant of summary_judgment on any ground supported by the record and adequately raised below
see glaxo inc. v. torpharm inc. 153_f.3d_1366 1371 fed.cir.1998 ; jaffke v. dunham 352_u.s._280 281 77_s.ct._307 1_l.ed.2d_314_(1957) per curiam
in moving for summary_judgment eon argued that claim 21 as well as the other claims the district_court invalidated under ¡± 101 was invalid under ¡± 102 not ¡± 101
accordingly the novelty of claim 21 was an issue presented to the district_court and an alternative_ground upon which the district_courts invalidation of the claim can be affirmed
see hester indus. inc. v. stein inc. 142_f.3d_1472 1480 fed.cir.1998 affirming summary_judgment of invalidity on ground advanced by defendant in summary_judgment motion but not adopted by district_court

because we have already determined that independent_claim 1 is anticipated dependent_claim 21s sole potential source of novelty is the` informing' limitation
king argues that the district_court committed legal_error because it never found the` informing' limitation disclosed in the prior_art which it was required to do
see atofina v. great lakes chem corp. 441_f.3d_991 999 fed.cir.2006` anticipation requires a showing that each limitation of a claim is found in a single reference either expressly or inherently`
eon tacitly concedes that the district_court never expressly found the` informing' limitation disclosed in the prior_art but contends such a finding was unnecessary because the nonpatentable` informing' limitation can not breathe novelty into an otherwise anticipated method

the specific question before us is whether an otherwise anticipated method_claim becomes patentable because it includes a step of` informing' someone about the existence of an inherent_property of that method
we hold it does not
the` informing' limitation adds no novelty to the method which is otherwise anticipated by the prior_art
in other_words in light of our holding that the method of taking metaxalone with food to increase the drugs bioavailability as recited in claim 1 is not patentable it readily follows that claim 21 which recites the same method with the sole additional step of informing the patient about this increase in bioavailability is not patentable

in an analogous context we have held that` [ w ] here the printed matter is not functionally related to the substrate the printed matter will not distinguish the invention from the prior_art in terms of patentability'
in re gulack 703_f.2d_1381 1385 fed.cir.1983 alterations added
in such cases we have recognized that the printed matter is not independently *1279 patentable but have cautioned that the limitation must not be excised from the claim
see id.at 1385` [ t ] he board can not dissect a claim excise the printed matter from it and declare the remaining portion of the mutilated claim to be unpatentable
the claim must be read as a whole'
( alterations added
instead the relevant question is whether` there exists any new and unobvious_functional_relationship between the printed matter and the substrate'
id.at 1386 citing in re miller 57_c.c.p.a._809 418_f.2d_1392 1396 1969
the rationale behind this line of cases is preventing the indefinite patenting of known products by the simple inclusion of novel yet functionally unrelated limitations
see in re ngai 367 f.3d at 1339

although these` printed matter' cases involved the addition of printed matter such as written instructions to a known product we see no principled reason for limiting their reasoning to that specific factual context
see in re ngai 367 f.3d at 1338-39 ; in re gulack 703 f.2d at 1385-87
rather we believe that the rationale underlying these cases extends to the situation presented in this case wherein an instructional_limitation is added to a method as opposed to a product known in the art
thus the relevant inquiry here is whether the additional instructional_limitation of claim 21 has a` new and unobvious_functional_relationship' with the known method of administering metaxalone with food
see in re ngai 367 f.3d at 1338 quoting in re gulack 703 f.2d at 1386

king contends that there is a functional relationship between the` informing' limitation and the method
specifically at oral_argument kings counsel argued that the` informing' limitation increases the likelihood that the patient will take metaxalone with food thereby increasing the efficiency of the method
see oral arg.at 7:30-8:26
this relationship however is not functional
informing a patient about the benefits of a drug in no way transforms the process of taking the drug with food
irrespective of whether the patient is informed about the benefits the actual method taking metaxalone with food is the same
in other_words the` informing' limitation` in no way depends on the [ method ] and the [ method ] does not depend on the [informing limitation ]'
in re ngai 367 f.3d at 1339 alterations added
`` it is not invention to perceive that the product which others had discovered had qualities they failed to detect'
gen. elec co. v. jewel incandescent lamp co. 326_u.s._242 249 66_s.ct._81 90_l.ed._43_(1945)
accordingly we affirm the district_courts finding that claim 21 is invalid but on the alternative_ground that the claim is anticipated by the prior_art

d. claim 22
claim 22 is closely related to claim 21
claim 22 depends from claim 1 and limits claim 1s method to situations` wherein the metaxalone is from a container with printed labeling advising that administration with food_results in an increase in the maximal_plasma_concentration cmax and extent of absorption auc last of metaxalone compared to administration without food'
the district_court relying on this courts printed matter precedent as articulated in in re ngai found the claim anticipated by fathie_ii albanese and abrams
see king_pharms. inc. 593 f.supp.2d at 513

because it depends from claim 1 the printed label_limitation is claim 22s only potential source of novelty
however as the district_court correctly found the printed label_limitation falls squarely within our printed matter cases discussed above with respect to claim 21
while ostensibly a method_claim the potentially novel aspect of claim 22 concerns a printed *1280 label on a product
like claim 21s` informing' limitation the printed label is not functionally related to either the product within the method_claim or the method_claim as a whole
therefore the district_court was correct in finding the claim anticipated
see in re ngai 367 f.3d at 1339

king attempts to avoid in re ngai by limiting that case to product_claims
according to king because claim 22 is a method_claim in re ngai which addressed a product claim is not applicable
during our discussion of claim 21 we rejected the notion that in re ngais holding should be limited solely to product_claims
accordingly we reject kings argument and affirm the district_courts finding that claim 22 is anticipated

we also affirm the district_courts invalidation of claims 7 9 and 12-15 of the ¡¬102_patent which are nearly identical to claim 22 of the ¡¬128_patent
the district_court invalidated these claims for the same_reasons it invalidated claim 22
on appeal king argues claims 7 9 and 12-15 of ¡¬102_patent are novel for the same_reasons claim 22 was allegedly novel i.e. their incorporation of a printed label_limitation
for the reasons discussed above we reject this argument and affirm the district_courts invalidation of claims 7 9 and 12-15 of ¡¬102_patent

ii
the ¡¬102_patent
a
claim 1
claim 1 of the ¡¬102_patent is an independent_claim which claims a` method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculoskeletal_conditions' comprising both` providing the patient with a therapeutically effective_amount of metaxalone' and` informing the patient that administration with food_results in an increase in the maximal_plasma_concentration cmax and extent of absorption auc last of metaxalone compared to administration without food'
the district_court held the claim was invalid under ¡± 101 for the same_reasons it invalidated claim 21 of the ¡¬128_patent
see king_pharms. inc. 593 f.supp.2d at 514
king contends the district_court erred because it failed to consider the claim as a whole

as we discussed with respect to claim 21 of the ¡¬128_patent we agree with king that the district_courts invalidation of claim 1 under ¡± 101 is improper because it ignored the claim as a whole and focused on one limitation
yet also like claim 21 claim 1s sole_source of novelty is the` informing' limitation
because this limitation is not functionally related to the otherwise anticipated method the claim is anticipated
accordingly we affirm the district_courts finding that claim 1 is invalid but on the alternative_ground that the claim is anticipated by the prior_art

because we reject kings argument that claim 1s` informing' limitation is novel we also affirm the district_courts finding of invalidity as to dependent_claims 2_through_4 and independent_claim 8 and its dependent_claims 10_and_11
for these claims king argued on appeal that their incorporation of the` informing' limitation claims 2-4 or their recitation of a similar limitation claims 8 10 and 11 made the claims novel
for the reasons discussed above we reject kings argument and find the claims anticipated by the prior_art

b
claim 5
claim 5 depends from claim 1 and limits the metaxalone to a` unit_dosage_form'
like claim 8 of the ¡¬128_patent the district_court found claim 5 obvious over albanese in light of dent
see king_pharms. inc. 593 f.supp.2d at 514

in addition to arguing that the` informing' limit provides the claim with novelty king argues that the district_court improperly disregarded kings evidence of secondary *1281 indicia of non-obviousness
kings secondary-considerations evidence consisted primarily of an expert report concerning sales of skelaxin from 1998_to_2003
as the district_court found however a significant portion of the increase in skelaxin sales occurred prior to the determination that ingesting metaxalone with food increases the drugs bioavailability and well before the patents issued
moreover king has not shown any nexus between the drugs alleged commercial_success and the specific invention claimed in claim 5
brown & williamson tobacco corp. v. philip morris inc. 229_f.3d_1120 1130 fed.cir.2000` a nexus between commercial_success and the claimed features is required`
with respect to claim 5 the claimed invention is the administration of metaxalone in a tablet that constitutes a` unit_dosage_form'
king has not shown any connection between administering metaxalone in a` unit_dosage_form' and the alleged commercial_success

turning to the district_courts obviousness analysis the district_court held that a prior_art_reference dent disclosed taking metaxalone in a single 400 mg_tablet four times a day
king_pharms. inc. 593 f.supp.2d at 511
dent does make such a disclosure
it would be obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art to combine dents teaching of taking a tablet dosage of metaxalone four times a day with albaneses teaching of administering metaxalone with food
see ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 421 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)` a person of ordinary_skill is also a person of ordinary creativity not an automaton`
accordingly the district_courts determination that claim 5 is obvious is affirmed

iii
jurisdiction over elan
in january 2003 after eon filed an anda with the food and drug administration` fda' for a generic 400 mg_metaxalone_tablet it was sued by elan for infringement of the ¡¬128_patent the 400 mg_action
while that suit was pending elan entered into a sale agreement with king in which elan transferred to king all of elans rights to skelaxin including the ¡¬128_patent and the application that would yield the ¡¬102_patent
the sale occurred on june_12,_2003 and a month later elan recorded a patent assignment agreement with the patent and trademark office assigning both the ¡¬128_patent and the application that would lead to the ¡¬102_patent to king

following the sale elan attempted to extricate itself from the 400 mg_action by moving to 1 substitute king as a plaintiff and 2 dismiss itself from the suit
in addition to its motion elan represented to the district_court in several letters that it no longer possessed any rights in the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s and that it was willing to enter into a stipulation to that effect
while elans motion to substitute king as the plaintiff in the 400 mg_action was pending king filed suit against eon when eon filed an anda with the fda for a generic 800 mg_metaxalone_tablet the 800 mg_action
in this second action eon filed several declaratory counterclaims against elan including a counterclaim of invalidity
the district_court initially consolidated the 400_and_800 mg_actions but eventually dismissed the 400 mg_action when eon withdrew its 400 mg metaxalone anda
however despite the dismissal of the 400 mg_action the district_court denied elans motion to substitute king as a plaintiff and dismiss elan from the consolidated litigation
instead the district_court dismissed various anticompetitive counterclaims eon had asserted against elan but maintained eons various invalidity counterclaims against elan

despite not being formally removed from the litigation elan did not participate *1282 in the merits proceedings of the litigation
indeed elan did not submit briefing in conjunction with eons motion for summary_judgment of invalidity and eon stated in a letter to the district_court that its motion was` directed at king not elan'
j.a.9700
nonetheless when issuing its final order declaring the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s invalid the district_court entered the order against both king and elan

on appeal elan argues that the district_court lacked jurisdiction to enter an invalidity_order against it
according to elan it sold all its rights to the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s prior to king filing suit and therefore the district_court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the counterclaim

in granting summary_judgment of invalidity the district_court did not address whether it had jurisdiction over elan
this court however must address the issue
see jenkins v. mckeithen 395_u.s._411 421 89_s.ct._1843 23_l.ed.2d_404_(1969)` [ s ] ince the question of standing goes to this courts jurisdiction we must decide the issue even though the court below passed over it without comment'
( citation omitted

whether an actual_case or controversy exists is reviewed de novo
see janssen pharmaceutica n.v. v. apotex inc. 540_f.3d_1353 1359 fed.cir.2008

eon has the burden of demonstrating an actual_case or controversy
see benitec_australia ltd. v. nucleonics inc. 495_f.3d_1340 1344 fed.cir.2007` the burden is on the party claiming declaratory_judgment_jurisdiction to establish that such jurisdiction existed at the time the claim for declaratory relief was filed and that it has continued since
``

eon has not met its burden of demonstrating the existence of an actual_case or controversy between it and elan
the acquisition documents between elan and king demonstrate quite clearly that elan sold all its interests in the asserted patents to king
for example the asset purchase agreement transferred` all skelaxin patent_rights' from elan to king
elan also produced the patent assignment agreement which unambiguously assigns` an undivided right title and interest in and to the patent_rights' to king
j.a.9653-54
the` patent_rights' include both the ¡¬128_patent and the application u.s. patent application no._10 /104,044 that issued as the ¡¬102_patent

moreover in a letter to the district_court elan stated it` will waive any rights it may have if any separate and apart from any rights it has transferred to the new patent owners to pursue any damages or relief from eon.. based on elans past ownership of the ¡¬128_patent'
j.a.7408
once the ¡¬102_patent issued elan wrote eons counsel and made a similar proposal concerning that patent
elan reiterated its proposals in several pleadings before the district_court and made a similar representation during oral_argument which eons counsel found sufficient
see oral arg.at 24:32-25:30 representation 25:43-25:48 acceptance by eons counsel

elans broad and unrestricted covenants not to sue eon for infringement of the ¡¬102 or ¡¬128_patent s remove any case or controversy that may have existed between the parties at one point
see microchip technology inc. v. chamberlain group inc. 441_f.3d_936 943 fed.cir.2006 vacating district_courts summary_judgment *1283 of invalidity because the declaratory judgment plaintiff could` not identif [ y ] a single legal claim that it believes [ the defendant ] could have brought against it in the absence of [ the ] declaratory judgment action' ; benitec_australia ltd. 495 f.3d at 1347-48 finding no case or controversy where patentee withdrew its infringement claims and covenanted not to sue the defendant for future acts
had elan retained the right to sue eon in some instances then an actual_case or controversy may exist
see revolution eyewear inc. v. aspex eyewear inc. 556_f.3d_1294 1298 fed.cir.2009 holding that covenant not to sue did not divest district_court of declaratory_judgment_jurisdiction because the covenant did not cover future products
elan however did not retain any such rights and its covenants not to sue confirm that there is no case or controversy between it and eon
accordingly we vacate the district_courts order of invalidity as entered against elan

in summary while the district_court erred in invalidating several of the claims as unpatentable under ¡± 101 all the claims of the ¡¬128 and ¡¬102_patent s are ultimately anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 or obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 in light of the prior_art
additionally the district_court erred in entering a judgment of invalidity against elan because no case or controversy currently exists between elan and eon.3
