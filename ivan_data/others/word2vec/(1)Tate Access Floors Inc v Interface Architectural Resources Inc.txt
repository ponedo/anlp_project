opinion
gajarsa circuit_judge
the defendant-appellant interface_architectural_resources inc.` interface' seeks review of a final judgment by the united_states_district_court for the district of maryland granting a motion by the plaintiff-appellees tate_access_floors inc. and tate_access_floors_leasing inc. together` tate' to preliminarily enjoin interface from infringing claims 1-big_token__4_and_8__big_token -10 of united states patent no._4625,491 the` ¡¬491_patent`
interface contends that the district_court erred by granting the preliminary_injunction because tate failed to make the requisite showing of a reasonable_likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement_claim
because the district_court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary_injunction we affirm

i
background
a
the ¡¬491_patent
tate owns the ¡¬491_patent which pertains to raised access_flooring_panels
¡¬491_patent col._1,_ll._6-9
raised access_flooring_panels provide an elevated_floor under which materials such as cables and pipes can be run
id.at col._1,_ll._15-19
the panels rest on pedestals
they are placed side-by-side to form an elevated_floor
by lifting and removing certain panels one can access the materials underneath the floor
id.at col._1,_ll._30-32

the panels addressed in the ¡¬491_patent have a laminated top surface
id.at col._1,_ll._57-63
the transparent laminate protects and covers a decorative top surface
id
these decorative panels are formed by heat bonding a decorative_top_layer onto a number of layers of underlying kraft paper using resin
id
the resulting edges of the laminated panels are brittle ; without protection they chip crack and appear aesthetically unpleasing

prior to the claimed invention the industry employed an add-on trim_strip to protect the edges of the panels and to make them look better
id.at col._1,_ll._33-36
such trim was problematic because it increased the cost of panels and tended to crack and become loose and to collect dirt and moisture
id.at col._1,_ll._42-46
the ¡¬491_patent addresses the problems associated with the edges of the panels without employing an add-on trim_strip

instead of adding trim the ¡¬491_patent solves the problem of brittle edges by removing the top decorative_layer from the periphery of the panels to form an integral trim edge
id.at col._1,_l._67 to col._2,_l._4
the two independent_claims at issue claims 1_and_8 read as follows 1
a floor_panel for elevated_floors comprising a rectangular base structure adapted to be supported at its corners and providing a load_surface operable to support loads_thereon a floor covering mounted on said load_surface providing a decorative exposed surface_layer on the side thereof opposite said load_surface said floor covering providing an inner_body_portion having an appearance contrasting with the appearance of said decorative_surface_layer said floor covering providing a border along the edges of said panels *1361 along which said decorative_surface_layer is removed to expose said inner_body_portion and thereby provide an integral contrasting border around said decorative_surface_layer
8
a floor_panel comprising a rectangular support structure providing a load_surface operable to support loads_thereon a layered laminated floor covering mounted on said load_surface providing a single_visible_decorative_layer along the side of said floor covering also providing an inner_layer contrasting with said decorative_layer having a thickness substantially greater than the thickness of the decorative_layer adjacent to said decorative_layer along the side thereof facing said load_surface said floor covering providing a border extending along the edges of said panel along which the decorative_layer is removed to expose said inner_layer
id.at col._4,_l._67 to col._5,_l._11 and col._5,_l._37 to col._6,_l._11 emphasis added

the specification includes figures depicting an embodiment of the claimed floor_panels
the periphery of the panels has a sloping or beveled portion as well as a flat horizontal_portion
for example figure 4 of the ¡¬491_patent depicts a panel with edges that appear as follows

?
b
the accused product
interfaces accused floor_panels have a decorative_top_layer with a beveled edge but no horizontal single-layered portion
an example of the accused panels follows

*1362. ?
interface contends that its panels fall outside the scope of the asserted claims of the ¡¬491_patent as properly construed by virtue of their simple beveled edges
it argues that the` border' limitations of claims 1_and_8 encompass only the horizontal_portion depicted in figure 4 of the ¡¬491_patent
because interfaces panels lack a horizontal_portion formed of a single_layer of material and contain only a beveled edge interface maintains that its panels do not infringe
tate contends that panels with beveled edges meet the` border' limitations notwithstanding the absence of a horizontal_portion formed of a single_layer of material

c. the district courts grant of preliminary injunction
the district_court properly noted that pursuant to this courts precedent interpreting 35 u.s.c.¡± 283 tates entitlement to a preliminary_injunction hinged on proof regarding four factors 1 likely_success on the merits including proof of infringement and lack of a substantial_question regarding interfaces invalidity defense ; 2 irreparable_harm absent an injunction ; 3 that the balance of hardships favors granting the injunction ; and 4 that public policy favors granting the injunction

equip. inc. 821_f.2d_646 647 3_uspq2d_1316 1317 fed.cir.1987 ; see also hybritech inc. v. abbott_labs. 849_f.2d_1446 1451 7_uspq2d_1191 1195 fed.cir.1988
after finding that tate had established each of the four factors the district_court granted the preliminary_injunction
tate 132 f.supp.2d at 379

on the first factor likely_success on the merits the district_court found that tate established likely_success on both validity and infringement
tate 132 f.supp.2d at 370-75
in its validity analysis the district_court noted that patents are presumed valid pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 and that the ¡¬491_patent withstood a validity challenge based on inventorship in prior litigation
tate 132 f.supp.2d at 371 citing tate_access_floors inc. v. maxcess techs. 222_f.3d_958 55_uspq2d_1513_(fed.cir.2000) affirming jury_verdict finding ¡¬491_patent infringed and not invalid
the district_court then independently rejected interfaces obviousness argument
it found that prior_art textbooks taught beveling the edges of laminate in other contexts but that ordinary_skill in the art *1363 of making floor_panels excluded making decorative beveled borders
tate 132 f.supp.2d at 371-72
the district_court also considered secondary factors of nonobviousness` the omnipresence of relatively expensive added trims in the market before the issuance of tates patent' and the commercial success of tates embodiment of the patent
id.at 372
prior to concluding its determination that tate proved likely_success on the merits regarding validity the district_court stated the remaining evidence of obviousness under factors 1_and_3 involves the prior_art in floor_panels
whether interface is practicing the prior_art constitutes an affirmative_defense to infringement
fiskars inc. v. hunt_mfg co. 221_f.3d_1318 1323 fed.cir.2000
i address this issue in discussing infringement
id

the district_court next determined that tate had proved likely_success on its infringement_claim
id.at 372-75
it noted properly that infringement analysis proceeds in two steps 1 claim_construction which begins with an assessment of the intrinsic_evidence and considers extrinsic evidence only if the intrinsic_evidence is unclear and then 2 comparison of the accused device to the construed claims
id.at 372

interface asserted that the term` border' in independent_claims 1_and_8 must be construed to mean a` recessed horizontal border formed of a single_layer'
id
under this construction interfaces panels would not infringe ; their edges lack a horizontal_layer and are formed only of a multi-layered bevel
interface also argued that the ¡¬491_patent could not be reasonably construed to cover its accused device
id

the district_court rejected interfaces claim_construction
it noted that it was bound to presume the claim_terms` mean what they say' to accord them their ordinary and accustomed_meaning and to turn to extrinsic evidence only if the intrinsic_evidence is unclear
id
( quoting johnson_worldwide_assocs
v. zebco_corp. 175_f.3d_985 989 50_uspq2d_1607 1610-11 fed.cir.1999
it then held that nothing in the language of the claims this courts claim_construction in tate access the specification or the prosecution_history of the ¡¬491_patent limits the claimed` border' to a horizontal single_layer
id.at 372-74
it concluded that the accused panels edge is lower and decorative and that as interface advertises the edge contrasts with the surface of the panel
id.at 374
accordingly the district_court held that the accused panel could be construed in accordance with tates motion and that it` has acontrasting border visible from above and the decorative_layer has been cut away to reveal that border'
id
thus it reasoned` [ t ] he claims can rationally be construed to cover interfaces panel'
id

the district_court also rejected interfaces` practicing the prior_art' defense which it treated as a defense to infringement
interface argued that if the ¡¬491_patent covers all beveled edges it would impermissibly cover prior_art panels with vertical edges and that westinghouse had sold floor_panels with edges beveled as in the accused device prior to tates invention
id
the court rejected this argument because it found that a vertically edged panel would lack the claimed integral contrasting border and decorative trim
id.at 375
second the court noted that there was some testimony that westinghouse sold` untrimmed laminate panels beveled in the way that the accused panels are beveled' but found the conflicting testimony regarding westinghouses prior_art insufficient to defeat tates likely_success on the merits
id.at 374-75
the district_court concluded` [ a ] lthough the issue is a somewhat close one i find a likelihood of success for tate'
id.at 375

*1364 after concluding that tate had established the requisite likelihood of success on both infringement and validity the district_court analyzed the remaining three preliminary_injunction_factors
it found that tate had established these factors as well
tate established with objective evidence that it would suffer irreparable_harm absent a preliminary_injunction despite also being entitled to a presumption of irreparable_harm due to its` strong showing of validity' and` quiteclear` showing on infringement
id.at 375-78
interface failed to rebut this presumption
id.at 378
the district_court next concluded that the balance of harms between tate and interface weighed slightly in tates favor
id.at 378-79
finally because it found no public health issue at stake and because of the strong public_interest in protecting patent rights the district_court found that the final factor-public_interest-also failed to preclude an injunction
id.at 379
accordingly the district_court preliminarily enjoined interface from infringing claims 1-big_token__4_and_8__big_token -10 of the ¡¬491_patent
tate_access_floors inc. v. interface architectural res. inc. no._00 cv 2543 d.md
mar._9,_2001 preliminary_injunction order

interface appeals
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

on appeal interface challenges only the district_courts determination regarding likely_success on the merits of tates infringement_claim
interface does not challenge the validity of the ¡¬491_patent nor does it contend that the district_court erred in its analysis of the remaining preliminary_injunction_factors
accordingly the crucial_question is whether the district_court properly construed the` border' limitations in independent_claims 1_and_8 to include beveled edges without a single horizontal_layer such as those contained in interfaces accused panels

interface argues that the district_court erred in determining that tate had demonstrated the likely_success of its infringement argument for two reasons
interfaces first and primary argument is that regardless of the claim_construction its accused products can not literally infringe the asserted claims of the ¡¬491_patent because interface merely practices the prior_art
in addition interface argues that as properly construed the` border' limitations exclude simple beveled edges such as those found in its accused floor_panels

ii
standard of review
the decision to grant a preliminary_injunction under 35 u.s.c.¡± 283 rests within the district_courts sound discretion
amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343 1350 57_uspq2d_1747 1751 fed.cir.2001
this court sustains such a grant absent an abuse of discretion
id
abuse of discretion requires a showing that the district_court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors or based its decision upon a clearly erroneous factual finding or an erroneous legal standard

iii
discussion
the moving party here tate is entitled to a preliminary_injunction if it shows the following four factors *1365 1 a reasonable_likelihood of success on the merits ; 2 irreparable_harm absent an injunction ; 3 that the balance of hardships tips in its favor ; and
( 4 that the public_interest favors an injunction
amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350 57 uspq2d at 1751
individually no factor is dispositive ; the district_court must weigh the factors against each other and against the form and magnitude of requested relief
id
( quoting hybritech inc. v. abbott_labs. 849_f.2d_1446 1451 7_uspq2d_1191 1195 fed.cir.1988

in order to demonstrate likely_success on the merits tate must show that in light of the presumptions and burdens applicable at trial it will likely prove that interface infringes the asserted claims of the ¡¬491_patent and that the patent will likely withstand interfaces challenges to its validity
see id
( citing genentech inc. v. novo nordisk a/s 108_f.3d_1361 1364 42_uspq2d_1001 1003 fed.cir.1997
if interface raises a substantial_question concerning infringement or validity meaning that it asserts a defense that tate can not prove` lacks substantial merit' the preliminary_injunction issued improperly
see id.at 1350-51 57 uspq2d at 1751

although the district_court found that tate had established likely_success on the merits regarding both infringement and validity only infringement is at issue in this appeal
as interface confirmed at oral argument interface did not appeal and does not challenge the district_courts determination that tate would likely prevail on the issue of validity
we will therefore affirm the district_courts order preliminarily enjoining interface from infringing the asserted claims of the ¡¬491_patent unless the district_court determined improperly that tate would likely prevail on its contention that interfaces panels infringe the asserted claims of the ¡¬491_patent

infringement analysis involves two steps the court first construes the scope of the asserted claims and then compares the accused device to the properly construed claims to determine whether each and every limitation of a claim is present either literally or equivalently in the accused device

claim construction is an issue of law reviewed de novo

comparing the accused product to the asserted claims is a question of fact that we review with substantial deference

a
practicing the prior art
interface first argues that regardless of the proper claim_construction its panels can not literally infringe because they merely practice the prior_art or that which would have been obvious in light of the prior_art
this contention lacks merit
see baxter healthcare corp. v. spectramed inc. 49_f.3d_1575 1583 34_uspq2d_1120 1126 fed.cir.1995

this court made unequivocally clear in baxter that there is no` practicing the prior_art' defense to literal_infringement
see 49 f.3d at 1583 34 uspq2d at 1126
baxter involved a jury_verdict that the defendant spectrameds accused products infringed either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents the asserted claims of baxters patent
*1366 baxter 49 f.3d at 1579 & n. 6 34 uspq2d at 1123 & n. 6
the district_court then entered judgment as a matter of law that spectramed did not infringe the asserted claims of baxters patent which claimed a method of calibrating blood pressure transducers
id.at 1580 49_f.3d_1575 34 uspq2d at 1124
this court reversed
we held that substantial evidence supported a finding of literal_infringement notwithstanding spectrameds argument that its accused devices could not infringe because they were constructed using only the teachings contained in the prior_art
id.at 1582-83 49_f.3d_1575 34 uspq2d at 1125-26
we explained implicit in spectrameds argument is that baxter in order to establish literal_infringement must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that spectrameds accused devices embody all the limitations in the asserted claims and in addition spectrameds accused devices must not be an adoption of the combined teachings of the prior_art
this is not a correct statement of the law governing patent_infringement
there is no requirement that the accused device be nonobvious in light of the prior_art or otherwise be itself patentable
literal_infringement exists if each of the limitations of the asserted claim s read on that is are found in the accused device
questions of obviousness in light of the prior_art go to validity of the claims not to whether an accused device infringes
id.at 1583 49_f.3d_1575 34 uspq2d at 1126 footnote omitted

thus our decision in baxter directly forecloses interfaces` practicing the prior_art' argument
interface attempts to distinguish baxter on the grounds that it` merely addresses the parties respective_burdens of proof when the prior_art_defense is raised'
it also seeks to glean authority for the putative` practicing prior_art' defense to literal_infringement from the doctrine of equivalents the reverse_doctrine of equivalents and an extension of a supreme_court case predating the 1952 patent act
we address these arguments below
even if they had merit-which they do not-this panel would not be free to overrule baxter
see vas-cath inc. v. mahurkar 935_f.2d_1555 1563 19_uspq2d_1111 1117 fed.cir.1991` [ w ] e note that decisions of a three-judge panel of this court can not overturn prior_precedential_decisions
`` ; kimberly-clark corp. v. ft. howard paper co. 772_f.2d_860 863 227_uspq_36 37 fed.cir.1985` counsel is apparently unaware that a panel of this court is bound by prior_precedential_decisions unless and until overturned en banc
`` ; see also yunus v. dept
of veterans affairs 242_f.3d_1367 1372_n._1_(fed.cir.2001) citing newell cos. inc. v. kenney mfg co. 864_f.2d_757 765 9_uspq2d_1417 1423 fed.cir.1988 for the proposition that upon direct conflict between federal_circuit decisions` the precedential decision is the first'

although the differing burdens of proof for infringement and validity are indeed important baxter in no way` merely addresses the parties respective_burdens of proof when the prior_art_defense [ to literal_infringement ] is raised'
the discussion in baxter cited above makes clear that literal_infringement is determined by construing the claims and comparing them to the accused device not by comparing the accused device to the prior_art
baxter 49 f.3d at 1583 34 uspq2d at 1126` there is no requirement that the accused device be nonobvious in light of the prior_art or otherwise be itself patentable
literal_infringement exists if each of the limitations of the asserted claim s read on that is are found in the accused device
``

interface cites several doctrine of equivalents cases in an attempt to bolster its` practicing the prior_art' defense to literal_infringement
they hold that the scope of equivalents may not extend so far as to *1367 ensnare prior_art
see fiskars inc. v. hunt_mfg co. 221_f.3d_1318 1323 55_uspq2d_1569 1573 fed.cir.2000 holding that the argument that a hypothetical_claim literally covering the accused device would be unpatentable is a defense to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents for which the defendant bears the burden of proof ; sextant avionique s.a. v. analog devices inc. 172_f.3d_817 827 49_uspq2d_1865 1871 fed.cir.1999 stating that the defendant would have had a` complete_defense' if practicing the prior_art because` the prior_art and prosecution_history estoppel provide independentpolicy oriented limitations on the doctrine of equivalents` emphasis added ; wilson sporting goods co. v. david geoffrey & assocs. 904_f.2d_677 685 14_uspq2d_1942 1948-49 fed.cir.1990` in this context it is important to remember that the burden is on wilson to prove that the range of equivalents which it seeks would not ensnare the prior_art uniroyal ball
``

with respect to literal_infringement these cases are inapposite
the doctrine of equivalents expands the reach of claims beyond their literal_language
that this expansion is guided and constrained by the prior_art is no surprise for the doctrine of equivalents is an equitable doctrine and it would not be equitable to allow a patentee to claim a scope of equivalents encompassing material that had been previously disclosed by someone else or that would have been obvious in light of others earlier disclosures
but this limit on the equitable extension of literal_language provides no warrant for constricting literal_language when it is clearly claimed

moreover just as the doctrine of equivalents can not extend so broadly as to ensnare prior_art claim_language should generally be construed to preserve validity if possible
see e.g. whittaker corp. v. unr indus. inc. 911_f.2d_709 712 15_uspq2d_1742 1744 fed.cir.1990
prior_art is relevant to literal_infringement only to the extent that it affects the construction of ambiguous claims
where the meaning of claim_language is clear in light of the specification however and properly supported by the patents disclosure the situation differs
fairness and the public notice function of the patent law require courts to afford patentees the full_breadth of clear claim_language and bind them to it as well
consequently where such claim_language clearly reads on prior_art the patent is invalid
see rhine v. casio inc. 183_f.3d_1342 1345 51_uspq2d_1377 1379 fed.cir.1999` [ i ] f the only_claim_construction that is consistent with the claims language and the written description renders the claim invalid then the axiom does not apply and the claim is simply invalid
``

our law requires patent challengers to prove invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
where an accused infringer is clearly practicing only that which was in the prior_art and nothing more and the patentees proffered construction reads on the accused device meeting this burden of proof should not prove difficult
nevertheless accused infringers are not free to flout the requirement of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence by asserting a` practicing prior_art' defense to literal_infringement under the less stringent preponderance of the evidence standard
moreover as in the doctrine of equivalents-ensnarement_cases and in the` construction to preserve validity' cases the fact that the patentee happens to be practicing the prior_art is irrelevant ; it is the presence of the prior_art and its relationship to the claim_language that matters for invalidity.1

*1368 neither the reverse_doctrine of equivalents nor the remaining precedent interface cites alters this result
interface argues that the existence of the reverse_doctrine of equivalents proves that the literal_infringement inquiry can not end upon a finding that a claim as properly construed reads on the accused device
the reverse_doctrine of equivalents interface contends may result in a finding of noninfringement even when the accused device possesses each and every limitation of an asserted claim
interface therefore urges this court to adopt its` practicing the prior_art' defense as a rebuttal similar to its conception of the reverse_doctrine of equivalents

we reject this argument
the supreme_court referred to the reverse_doctrine of equivalents in graver_tank & manufacturing co. v. linde air products co. 339_u.s._605 608-609 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097 85_uspq_328 330 1950
it applies` where a device is so far changed in principle from a patented article that it performs the same or a similar function in a substantially different way but nevertheless falls within the literal words of the claim'
id.at 609 339_u.s._605 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097 85 uspq at 330
in such a case the reverse_doctrine of equivalents` may be used to restrict the claim and defeat the patentees action for infringement'
id

not once has this court affirmed a decision finding noninfringement based on the reverse_doctrine of equivalents
and with good reason when congress enacted 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 after the decision in graver_tank it imposed requirements for the written description enablement definiteness and means-plus-function_claims that are co-extensive with the broadest possible reach of the reverse_doctrine of equivalents
see in re donaldson co. 16_f.3d_1189 1194 & n. 5 29_uspq2d_1845 1849-50 & n. 5 fed.cir.1994 rejecting commissioners argument that by enacting ¡± 112 congress intended only to codify the reverse_doctrine of equivalents and thereby to render the requirements applicable only in the litigation context and therefore holding that the requirements of ¡± 112 ?
6 apply to all interpretations of means-plus-function claim_language but noting that one result of enacting ¡± 112 may have been to codify the reverse_doctrine of equivalents ; cf

even were this court likely ever to affirm a defense to literal_infringement based on the reverse_doctrine of equivalents the presence of one anachronistic exception long mentioned but rarely applied is hardly reason to create another
we therefore decline the invitation to adopt interfaces` practicing the prior_art' defense on these grounds

we also will not do so on the basis of interfaces argument that the supreme_court sanctioned the` practicing prior_art' defense in scott_paper co. v. marcalus mfg co. 326_u.s._249 66_s.ct._101 90_l.ed._47 67_uspq_193_(1945)2 interfaces *1369 argument is misguided
scott_paper announced no broad` practicing the prior_art' defense to literal_infringement

in scott_paper the supreme_court carved out an exception to the doctrine of assignor_estoppel
id.at 257 66_s.ct._101 67 uspq at 197` [ t ] he patent_laws preclude the petitioner assignee from invoking the doctrine of estoppel' where the assignors accused device was disclosed in a prior patent
) ; see also diamond scientific co. v. ambico inc. 848_f.2d_1220 1222-23 6_uspq2d_2028 2029 fed.cir.1988 noting that in scott_paper the supreme_court carved an exception to the rule that an assignor was estopped from challenging the validity of a patent
the plaintiff-assignee accused the defendant of infringing a patent the defendant had assigned to the plaintiff in exchange for valuable consideration
id.at 250 66_s.ct._101 67 uspq at 194
the defendant-assignor maintained that his accused device was a copy of that disclosed in an expired prior_art_patent
id
the district_court held that the assignor was estopped from challenging the patents validity under the doctrine of assignor_estoppel and could not resort to an argument of noninfringement based on the prior_art to` accomplish the same result by indirection'
id
the court of appeals reversed allowing the assignor to` measure the extent of anticipation for the purpose of limiting the claims of the assigned patent and thus avoid infringement'
id

the supreme_court affirmed
it explained the judgment is affirmed for the reason that we find that the application of the doctrine of estoppel so as to foreclose the assignor of a patent from asserting the right to make use of the prior_art invention of an expired patent which anticipates that of the assigned patent is inconsistent with the patent_laws which dedicate to public use the invention of an expired patent
the assignor has a complete_defense to an action for infringement where the alleged infringing device is that of an expired patent
id.at 257-58 66_s.ct._101 67 uspq at 197 emphasis added

as the above paragraph indicates the scott_paper rationale was based on the premise that the assigned patent would be invalid due to anticipation were it coextensive with the expired prior_art_patent
id
the statement that in such circumstances the assignor has a` complete_defense to an action for infringement` must be understood in context
id
( emphasis added
of course under the present scheme invalidity is a defense to an action for patent_infringement
this general statement provides no license for asserting that a particular defense if successful results in noninfringement as opposed to invalidity

moreover the court of appeals decision that the supreme_court affirmed in scott_paper was premised on claim_construction to preserve validity not on noninfringement
id.at 251 66_s.ct._101 67 uspq at 194-95` the court of appeals reversed holding that the prior_art may be resorted to by the assignor to measure the extent of anticipation for the purpose of limiting the claims of the assigned patent and thus avoid infringement'
( emphasis added citation omitted
this is consistent with our case law holding that if possible claims are construed to preserve validity
it certainly announces no general rule that` practicing prior_art' is an affirmative_defense precluding literal_infringement

*1370 b
claim construction
interfaces second argument is that the district_court erred in construing the` border' limitations in independent_claims 1_and_8 to encompass the simple beveled edges in its accused floor_panels
this argument also fails

claim interpretation begins as always with the language of the claims
johnson_worldwide_assocs. inc. v. zebco_corp. 175_f.3d_985 989 50_uspq2d_1607 1610 fed.cir.1999
`` [ a ] court must presume that the terms in the claim mean what they say and unless otherwise compelled give full effect to the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of claim_terms'
id
( citing nike inc. v. wolverine world wide inc. 43_f.3d_644 646 33_uspq2d_1038 1039 fed.cir.1994 ; e.i
du_pont_de_nemours & co. v. phillips_petroleum 849_f.2d_1430 1433 7_uspq2d_1129 1131 fed.cir.1988 ; envirotech corp. v. al george inc. 730_f.2d_753 759 221_uspq2d_473 477 fed.cir.1984
this strong presumption in favor of the ordinary meaning of claim_language as understood by one of ordinary_skill in the art may be overcome where 1 the patentee has chosen to become his or her own_lexicographer by clearly and explicitly defining the claim_term ; or 2 where the claim_term would render the claim devoid of clarity such that there is` no means by which the scope of the claim may be ascertained from the language used'

network servs. inc. v. covad communications group inc. 262_f.3d_1258 1268 59_uspq2d_1865 1870 fed.cir.2001 quoting johnson 175 f.3d at 990 50 uspq2d at 1610

one ordinarily skilled in the art of raised access floor_panels would understand the term` border' to refer to the area or zone forming an edge or trim framing the decorative surface of the panel
independent_claim 1 recites` a border along the edges of said panels along which said decorative_surface_layer is removed to expose said inner_body_portion'
¡¬491_patent col._4,_l._67 to col._5,_l._11
independent_claim 8 recites` a border extending along the edges of said panel along which the decorative_layer is removed to expose said inner_layer'
id.at col._5,_l._37 to col._6,_l._11
nothing in the language of these claims requires the` border' to be horizontal or formed of a single_layer

the` border' in claim 1 is formed by exposing an` inner_body_portion'
a portion may certainly consist of one or more_layers

the` border' in claim 8 is formed by exposing` said inner_layer'
that language refers to the phrase` an inner_layer' which first appears earlier in claim 8
¡¬491_patent col._6,_l._5
it is well settled that the term` a' or` an' ordinarily means` one or more'
tate_access_floors inc. v. maxcess techs. inc. 222_f.3d_958 966_n._4 55_uspq2d_1513 1518 citing elkay mfg co. v. ebco mfg co. 192_f.3d_973 977 52_uspq2d_1109 1112 fed.cir.1999
moreover additional language in claim 8 suggests that` an inner_layer' means one or more_layers
the relevant portion of claim 8 reads as follows a single_visible_decorative_layer along the side of said floor covering also providing an inner_layer contrasting with said decorative_layer having a thickness substantially greater than the thickness of the decorative_layer adjacent to said decorative_layer along the side thereof facing said load_surface..491_patent col._6,_ll._2-9 emphasis added
the language` an inner_layer' must be read in the context of the language claiming` a single_visible_decorative_layer ;' where the patentee meant to constrict the claim to one and only one particular layer he said so clearly
moreover the reference to substantially greater thickness also suggests that the claimed inner_layer may consist of one or more_layers because *1371 increasing the layers would increase the thickness.3

like the claim_language the remainder of the specification supports construing the term` border' to include multiple_layers framing the decorative_paper
of course limitations from elsewhere in the specification will not be read in where as here the claim_terms are clear
see e.g. toro co. v. white consol
indus. inc. 266_f.3d_1367 1371 60_uspq2d_1437 1439 fed.cir.2000 citing e.i
du_pont_de_nemours & co. v. phillips_petroleum 849_f.2d_1430 1433 7_uspq2d_1129 1131 fed.cir.1988 holding that it is improper to import an extraneous limitation from elsewhere in the specification into the claim ; see also kahn 135 f.3d at 1476 45 uspq2d at 1611 distinguishing means-plus-function_claims from the ordinary situation in which claims may not be limited by functions or elements disclosed in the specification but not included in the claims themselves

nevertheless we note that this is not a case in which the patentee acted as his own_lexicographer and that the written description supports our construction
in pertinent part it reads rearwardly of the decorative_paper the floor covering material is provided with layers of material having a contrasting color with respect to the decorative_paper
in accordance with the present invention the surface_layer of protective material and the layer of decorative_paper are cut away along the edge of the floor covering to expose the inner_layers and provide a contrasting color integral border within the floor covering material itself
'491_patent col._1,_l._65 to col._2,_l._4 emphasis added
this language contradicts interfaces position that the description requires construing the claimed` border' as a single horizontal_layer
interface emphasizes the statement that` a uniform exposure of the layers of black paper is obtained'
¡¬491_patent col._3,_ll._53-54
this language however merely underscores that the border is formed by uniformly exposing multiple_layers not by exposing a single_layer
thus the written description plainly contemplates that the claimed contrasting color border can be formed of multiple_layers of material

interface argues that notwithstanding this language figures 3_and_4 of the ¡¬ 491 patent compel its construction of the` border' limitations
this is allegedly so because the arrow corresponding to the` integral border or edge trim 14' ¡¬491_patent col._2,_l._54 aims at a horizontal single_layer of exposed trim
this argument fails
even were we to accept the proposition that the arrow in figures 3_and_4 points only to the horizontal single-layered portion of the border rather than to the beveled portion which is also clearly exposed and which is formed of multiple_layers of material additional limitations from these figures can not be imported into the unambiguous claim_language

contrary to interfaces next contention nothing in the prosecution_history or elsewhere in the prior_art of record,4 renders proper a construction that *1372 limits the claimed` border' to a single horizontal_layer
interface would have us adopt its narrow_construction in order to preserve the validity of the ¡¬491_patent
it contends that the prior_art would render the asserted claims obvious if they cover floor_panels with simple beveled edges such as its accused products

even if this were so where claim_language is clear we must accord it full_breadth even if the result is a claim that is clearly invalid
apple computer inc. v. articulate sys. inc. 234_f.3d_14 24 57_uspq2d_1057 1064 fed.cir.2000 explaining that claims should be read to preserve validity but only where it is possible to do so and holding that it was impossible and that therefore the claims were simply invalid citing rhine v. casio inc. 183_f.3d_1342 1344 51_uspq2d_1377 1379 fed.cir.1999 where` the only_claim_construction that is consistent with the claims language and the written description renders the claim invalid then the axiom does not apply and the claim is simply invalid
``

conclusion
the district_court committed no abuse of discretion in determining that tate demonstrated its entitlement to a preliminary_injunction including a reasonable_likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement_claim
the grant of preliminary_injunction barring interface from infringing claims 1-big_token__4_and_8__big_token -10 of the ¡¬491_patent is therefore affirmed

these ensnarement_cases test the relationship between the prior_art and the scope of the pertinent claims by asking whether a hypothetical_claim that reads on the accused device would be unpatentable because it would be anticipated or obvious in light of the prior_art
the accused device is surely a reference point for construing such a hypothetical_claim
the crucial_question however is whether the claims if so construed would be unpatentable
2
interface also cites several cases from the seventh circuit in support of its practicing the prior_art_defense
see rex chainbelt inc. v. gen. kinematics corp. 363_f.2d_336 150_uspq_319_(7th_cir.1966) assignor_estoppel ; dixie-vortex co. v. paper container mfg co. 130_f.2d_569 54_uspq_440_(7th_cir.1942) ; casco prods corp. v. sinko tool & mfg co. 116_f.2d_119 47_uspq_484_(7th_cir.1940) licensee estoppel
these cases are not binding precedent on the federal_circuit and we decline to treat them as such
3
because we conclude independently that the` border' limitations in claims 1_and_8 both properly encompass one or more_layers we need not address the issue of whether interface is bound by this courts prior determination in tate v. maxcess 222 f.3d at 968 55 uspq2d at 1518-19 that the` inner_body_portion' and` inner_layer' limitations forming the borders are co-extensive
4
in construing claims we look first to the intrinsic_evidence of record-the patent including the claims remainder of the specification and if it is in evidence the prosecution_history
vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 39_uspq2d_1573 1576 fed.cir.1996
the court may not vary the meaning of claim_language when that meaning is clear from the intrinsic_evidence
prior_art cited in the prosecution_history falls within the category of intrinsic_evidence
prior_art the examiner failed to consider is extrinsic
in the present case however we will discuss all of the prior_art on which interface now seeks to rely because none of it compels its narrow_construction of the term` border'
