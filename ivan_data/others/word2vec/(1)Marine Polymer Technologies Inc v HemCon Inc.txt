defendant-appellant hemcon inc.` hemcon' appeals from a judgment of the united_states_district_court for the district of new_hampshire holding that hemcon infringed u.s. patent 6,864,245` the ¡¬245_patent` assigned to plaintiff-appellee marine_polymer technologies inc.` marine_polymer'
on september 26 2011 a panel of this court reversed the district_courts decision concluding that hemcon had acquired intervening rights in the ¡¬245_patent based on actions taken by marine_polymer during a parallel_reexamination_proceeding
marine_polymer_techs. inc. v. hemcon inc. 659_f.3d_1084 fed.cir.2011` panel_opinion` vacated 475_fed.appx._315 2012_wl_255331 fed.cir
jan. 20 2012
upon reconsideration en banc we affirm the judgment of the district_court by an equally divided court
although the district_court did not have the reexamination before it or decide the effect of that issue on its decision we also consider hemcons arguments with respect to the reexamination and a majority of this court concludes as an alternative_ground for affirmance that intervening rights do not apply to claims that have not been amended and are not new

background
marine_polymer owns the ¡¬245_patent which discloses and claims preparations of poly-£]-1¡÷4-n-acetylglucosamine` p-glcnac' a naturally occurring polysaccharide polymer produced by organisms such as arthropods fungi and microalgae
purified p-glcnac has utility in various industrial pharmaceutical and bio-medical applications
for example p-glcnac promotes hemostasis i.e. stoppage of bleeding or hemorrhage and is therefore useful in trauma units for treating serious wounds

the ¡¬245_patent places particular emphasis on` biocompatible' compositions of p-glcnac
in this context biocompatibility relates to a compounds biological_reactivity or tendency to elicit deleterious reactions-e.g. necrosis erythema edema cellular degeneration-upon exposure to living cells or tissues
e.g. ¡¬245_patent col.42 ll.36-38 col.44 ll.15-16
the specification describes four tests that can be used to assess the biocompatibility of a substance an elution_test an implantation_test an intracutaneous_injection_test and a systemic_injection_test
id
col.42 ll.1-3
*1355 the disclosed elution_test involves exposing a test_substance to a solution to create an extract exposing cultured test cells to the extract and then observing the cells for signs of cytotoxicity
see id
col.42 ll.6-62
the implantation_test involves implanting a sample of the test_substance into an animals muscle tissue and scoring the severity of any adverse local reactions
see id
col.42 l.64-col.43 l.64
the intracutaneous_injection_test calls for preparing an extract of the test_substance injecting small volumes of the extract into the skin of an animal and monitoring the injection sites for reactivity
see id
col.43 l.65-col.44 l.56
finally in the systemic_injection_test animals are monitored for weight changes and other overt signs of toxicity after receiving intravenous or intraperitoneal injections of a test_substance extract
see id
col.44 l.57-col.45 l.42

in describing these biocompatibility_tests the specification indicates that their requirements are met if a given test_substance shows no more than mild or slight_reactivity
for example scores on the elution_test range from zero to four on a scale of biological_reactivity where zero represents no reactivity one represents slight_reactivity two represents mild_reactivity and three or four represent moderate or severe reactivity respectively and a substance can satisfy the elution_test` if none of the cultures treated with the test_article show a greater than mild_reactivity'
id
col.42 ll.41-62
but with regard to the claimed p-glcnac compositions the specification also states that` the p-glcnac of the invention exhibits no detectable_biological_reactivity as assayed by elution_tests intramuscular_implantation in rabbits intracutaneous_injection in rabbits and systemic injections in mice'
id
col.41 l.66-col.42_l.3 ; see also col.45 l.44-col.49 l.66 reporting biocompatibility_test results for p-glcnac showing zero reactivity on each test

the ¡¬245_patent issued with 22 claims all of which recite` biocompatible' compositions of p-glcnac
a majority of those claims recite the` biocompatible' limitation generically
independent_claim 6 is representative a biocompatible_poly-£]-1¡÷4-n-acetylglucosamine comprising up to about 150,000 n-acetylglucosamine_monosaccharides covalently attached in a £]-1¡÷4_conformation and having a molecular_weight of up to about 30 million daltons in which at least one n-acetylglucosamine_monosaccharide has been deacetylated
id
col.72_ll.5-10 emphasis added
in addition the ¡¬245_patent contains several dependent_claims that recite specific scores on the elution_test
for example claim 12 claims` the biocompatible_poly-£]-1¡÷4-n-acetylglucosamine of any one of claims 6-11 which has an elution_test_score of 0'
id
col.72 ll.33-35 emphasis added
claims 3_and_20 also specify zero scores on the elution_test ; analogous claims 4 5 13 14 21 and 22 require elution_test_scores of one or two
e.g. id
col.72 ll.33-41

marine_polymer sued hemcon in march 2006 alleging that hemcon infringed the ¡¬ 245 patent
during subsequent markman proceedings marine_polymer argued that` biocompatible' p-glcnac should be construed to mean` biomedically pure [ p-glcnac ] that reproducibly exhibits acceptably low_levels of adverse_bioreactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests'
marine_polymer_techs. inc. v. hemcon inc. no._06-_cv-100 2008_wl_1995454 at *1 d.n.h
may_6,_2008
hemcon countered that` biocompatible' should be read as limiting the claims to p-glcnac that had been` harvested from plant microalgae' or in the alternative should be interpreted broadly to mean` suited for biomedical_applications'
id.at *1-2
the district_court considered and ultimately *1356 rejected each of the parties proposed constructions after reviewing the ¡¬245_patents claim_language written description and prosecution_history
instead the district_court concluded that` biocompatible' p-glcnac as claimed in the ¡¬245_patent means p-glcnac` with low_variability high_purity and no detectable_biological_reactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests'
id.at *10

marine_polymer then moved for summary_judgment that hemcon literally infringed claims 6 7 10-12 17 and 20 of the ¡¬245_patent
applying its claim_construction the district_court granted marine_polymers motion and held that hemcon had infringed all seven asserted_claims
a jury trial followed to determine validity and damages
the jury made factual_findings relating to obviousness and determined that the ¡¬245_patent was not anticipated by the cited prior_art
with respect to damages the jury found that marine_polymer was entitled to a reasonable_royalty of $ 29,410,246
after the jury_verdict hemcon filed motions for judgment as a matter of law` jmol' on anticipation on the jurys factual_findings relating to obviousness and challenging the damages_award as not supported by substantial_evidence
the district_court denied each of the motions and made a further legal determination that the asserted_claims were not obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the district_court entered a permanent_injunction on september 16 2010 barring hemcon from further infringement of the asserted_claims and issued its final_judgment on september 22 2010
hemcon appealed the decision to this court

in august 2009 while the infringement litigation was still before the district_court hemcon filed a request for ex parte_reexamination of the ¡¬ 245 patent in the united_states patent and trademark office` pto'
hemcons reexamination_request cited ten prior_art_references-all of which according to hemcon raised substantial new questions of patentability for the ¡¬245_patent given the construction of` biocompatible' adopted by the district_court
j.a
40740-41
in response the pto granted hemcons reexamination_request initiated reexamination_proceedings and issued a non-final office action on april_1,_20103 in this first office action the examiner adopted a construction of` biocompatible' different from the district_courts concluding that under its broadest reasonable interpretation the term meant` low_variability high_purity and little or no detectable_reactivity'
j.a
39503 emphasis added
noting that dependent_claims 4 5 13 14 21 and 22 of the ¡¬245_patent required elution_test_scores of one or two corresponding to slight or mild_reactivity on that test as defined in the specification the examiner explained that the district_courts construction requiring` no detectable_biological_reactivity' conflicted with those claims while his interpretation avoided such inconsistency
the examiner then rejected all of the original 22 claims as invalid under his broader construction in light of the cited prior_art
in so doing he relied primarily on three prior_art_references-a scientific article sandford and two patents peniston and malette -finding that each reference explicitly disclosed nearly all of the limitations of every claim
with respect to the` biocompatible' limitation the examiner explained that any difference between the claimed biocompatibility and that disclosed by sandford peniston and malette was` minor' and would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art at the *1357 time of the invention
j.a
39507 ; see also 39517 39522

in response marine_polymer addressed` the improper dependency noted by the examiner' by cancelling all six claims that had recited elution_test_scores of one or two i.e. claims that expressly required at least some reactivity while leaving each of the remaining claims 1-3 6-12 and 15-20 unaltered
having deleted the inconsistent claims marine_polymer argued that` the [ district_courts ] interpretation of the termbiocompatible should be adopted in this reexamination' in view of various consistent teachings within the specification
j.a
37688-90
with all conflicting claims cancelled the examiner` agree [ d ] with the [ district ] courts construction of the term biocompatible as derived from the specification of the.. ¡¬245_patent'
j.a
39481
furthermore the examiner withdrew all rejections in view of that narrower construction and confirmed the remaining claims as patentable
id

the pto did not provide notice of its intent to issue a reexamination_certificate for the ¡¬245_patent until november 3 2010 after the district_court had entered final_judgment in marine_polymers infringement action
hemcon timely appealed from the district_courts judgment and on november 18 2010 a motions panel of this court granted a stay of the damages_award and permanent_injunction pending appeal
on march_29,_2011 the pto issued the final reexamination_certificate` ¡¬245_reexam

`` which cancelled dependent_claims 4 5 13 14 21 and 22 and confirmed the patentability of claims 1-3 6-12 and 15-20 in accordance with the examiners decision

a panel of this court heard oral arguments in hemcons appeal from the district_courts judgment on june_7,_2011 and issued a decision on september 26 2011 in which a majority reversed the district_courts judgment on infringement and vacated the injunction and the damages_award on grounds that hemcon had acquired intervening rights during reexamination of the ¡¬245_patent

b
claim_construction
hemcon argues that the district_courts construction of` biocompatible' to mean` low_variability high_purity and no detectable_biological_reactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests' was erroneous and warrants reversal of the judgment
in supporting this assertion hemcon relies primarily on the presence of the six dependent_claims in the original ¡¬245_patent eventually cancelled in reexamination that required elution_test_scores of one or two as well as passages in the written description characterizing certain biocompatibility_tests as being satisfied despite detectable bioreactivity
hemcon therefore proposes a broader alternative construction` suitable for biomedical_applications' that it argues would better align with the teachings in the specification and render the asserted_claims invalid

we disagree
the district_courts interpretation of` biocompatible' is supported by intrinsic evidence and we therefore uphold that construction
our claim_construction analysis begins with the language of the claim itself as it would have been understood by a person of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention
phillips v. awh_corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1312-13 fed.cir.2005 en banc quoting vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996` we look to the words of the claims themselves.. to define the scope of the patented_invention'
faced with widely varying proposed definitions from the parties the district_court did not find that` biocompatible' had a plain and ordinary meaning to one skilled in the art
the district_court properly looked first to the claims of the ¡¬ 245 patent and determined that they` do not definebiocompatible
`` marine_polymer 2008_wl_1995454 at *3

although several of the dependent_claims specify that the` biocompatible' p-glcnac may exhibit mild_reactivity in an elution_test i.e.` an elution_test_score of 1' or` an elution_test_score of 2' the majority of the claims use the term` biocompatible' generically without any reference to a biocompatibility_test score
because the term` biocompatible' admits of no limitation based on the context of the claims the district_court properly turned to the teachings of the specification

the specification teaches that the p-glcnac` of the invention' has` a high_degree of biocompatibility' and directs the reader to a portion of the specification that` demonstrates the high biocompatibility of the p-glcnac of the invention'
¡¬245_patent col.10 ll.49-62
further the cited material provides empirical test results showing that the p-glcnac of the invention exhibited zero reactivity on each disclosed biocompatibility_test id
col.45 ll.45-50 col.46 ll.10-big_token__11_and_66__big_token -67 col.49 ll.26-29 and summarizes the results as follows` [ i ] t is demonstrated that the p-glcnac of the invention exhibits no detectable_biological_reactivity as assayed by elution_tests intramuscular_implantation in rabbits intracutaneous_injection in rabbits and systemic *1359 injections in mice'
id
col.41 l.66-col.42_l.3
thus the specification supports the district_courts claim_construction
see e.g. netcraft corp. v. ebay inc. 549_f.3d_1394 1398 fed.cir.2008` [ t ] he common specifications repeated use of the phrasethe present_invention describes the invention as a whole..' ; verizon servs corp. v. vonage holdings corp. 503_f.3d_1295 1308 fed.cir.2007` when a patent thus describes the features of thepresent_invention as a whole this description limits the scope of the invention
`` ; honeywell int l inc. v. itt indus. inc. 452_f.3d_1312 1318 fed.cir.2006 limiting claims to a fuel_filter where` the written description refers to the fuel_filter asthis invention orthe present_invention`4

hemcons arguments highlighting an inconsistency between the district_courts construction and the claims requiring non-zero elution_test_scores while not baseless essentially amount to a conflict between teachings in the specification and the doctrine of claim_differentiation
as we have held claim_differentiation is` not a hard and fast rule and will be overcome by a contrary_construction dictated by the written description or prosecution_history'
seachange_int l inc. v. c-cor inc. 413_f.3d_1361 1369 fed.cir.2005 ; see also laitram_corp. v. rexnord inc. 939_f.2d_1533 1538 fed.cir.1991` claim differentiation is a guide not a rigid rule`
such description appears in the specification here as indicated above

we also find hemcons focus on the possibility of nonzero` passing' scores on the disclosed biocompatibility_tests unpersuasive
in describing` materials and methods' for the four disclosed biocompatibility_tests the specification indicates that for example test_substances may` meet [ ] the biocompatibility_test if none.. show a greater than mild_reactivity'
¡¬ 245 patent col.42 ll.42-44
but such language appears only in generalized descriptions of these test methods ; when read as a whole the specification makes clear that the p-glcnac of the invention outperforms baseline standards and shows` no detectable_biological_reactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests'
the district_courts construction of` biocompatible' as meaning p-glcnac` with low_variability high_purity and no detectable_biological_reactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests' is therefore affirmed by an equally divided court.5

c. infringement
following its decision on claim_construction the district_court ruled on summary_judgment that hemcon infringed claims 6 7 10-12 17 and 20 of the ¡¬ 245 patent
on appeal hemcons noninfringement challenge regarding claims 6 7 10 11 and 17 hinges entirely on its failed claim_construction arguments and hemcon does not otherwise dispute its infringement of these claims
with regard to claims_12_and_20 hemcon raises an additional defense arguing that the district_court lacked sufficient evidence to establish literal_infringement because hemcons products allegedly can not undergo elution_testing *1360 as required by those claims
however hemcon has waived that argument by failing to raise it in opposing summary_judgment and we therefore need not consider it here
pandrol usa lp v. airboss ry
prods. inc. 320_f.3d_1354 1366-67 fed.cir.2003
accordingly we affirm the district_courts judgment regarding infringement of claims 6 7 10-12 17 and 20 by an equally divided court

d. damages
finally hemcon seeks to overturn the jurys award of $ 29,410,246 in damages as unreasonable and not supported by substantial_evidence
specifically hemcon argues that marine_polymers expert lacked a sufficient basis for his testimony on what would constitute a reasonable_royalty rate and that the jury improperly relied on the entire_market_value for its damages calculation
during trial both parties presented expert testimony on damages
marine_polymers expert testified that based on his evaluation of the case a reasonable_royalty would range from about 26-34 % of hemcons infringing sales and he settled on 30 % or $ 29,410,246 as the appropriate award
in contrast hemcons expert testified that 2-4 % of all infringing sales represented the correct range concluding that marine_polymers reasonable_royalties would total $ 2,767,589

both experts used the total sales of the accused products containing the infringing biocompatible_p-glcnac as the royalty_base
the use of the entire_market_value as the royalty_base is acceptable to the extent that the patent_owner proves that` the patent-related feature is the basis for customer demand'
lucent techs. inc. v. gateway inc. 580_f.3d_1301 1336 fed.cir.2009 internal quotations omitted
the district_court correctly found that the record contains substantial_evidence to support a damages_award based on the entire_market_value of hemcons infringing products including` evidence pertaining to the importance of biocompatible_p-glcnac in hemcons products and its significance for market demand'
marine_polymer_techs. inc. v. hemcon inc. no._06-_cv-100 2010_wl_3070201 at *4 d.n.h
aug._3,_2010

ultimately the jury was entitled to evaluate this conflicting evidence and credit the testimony of marine_polymers expert over that of hemcon as it did
the jury also heard testimony from witnesses for both parties including hemcons own president describing the claimed p-glcnac as` critical' to the core hemostatic function of the accused products
in sum based on the evidence of record the jurys damages_award was supported by substantial_evidence
in such cases we may not` substitute [ our ] choice for that of the jury'
brooktree corp. v. advanced micro devices inc. 977_f.2d_1555 1580 fed.cir.1992
the damages_award is therefore affirmed by an equally divided court

ii
intervening_rights
in addition hemcon argues that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬245_patent changed in scope during reexamination hemcon thereby acquired intervening rights in those claims and the district_courts finding of infringement should therefore be reversed
to support its intervening rights_defense hemcon asserts that the district_courts interpretation of` biocompatible' incorrectly narrowed the term by requiring` no detectable_biological_reactivity'
according to hemcon the district_courts construction conflicts not only with statements in the written description but also with the presence of dependent_claims reciting elution_test_scores of one or two-claims that permit slight or mild_reactivity and were in the original version of the ¡¬245_patent that was before the district_court
*1361 hemcon contends that` biocompatible' at least as represented in the ¡¬245_patent before reexamination therefore must have encompassed low non-zero levels of bioreactivity so that the proper construction at that time was necessarily broader than the district_courts interpretation

next hemcon argues that by cancelling dependent_claims 4 5 13 14 21 and 22 and persuading the examiner to adopt the district_courts construction of` biocompatible' during reexamination marine_polymer effected a substantive_change in the scope of each remaining claim-essentially from allowing some reactivity in the originally issued claims to permitting` no detectable_biological_reactivity' after reexamination
citing our decision in laitram_corp. v. nec_corp. 163_f.3d_1342 1346-47 fed.cir.1998 hemcon argues that the key to intervening rights lies in determining` whether the scope of the reexamined_claims differs from the original_claims'
corrected br
for defendant-appellant at 37 2010_wl_5650491
hemcon thus concludes that this perceived` substantive_change' to the surviving claims of the ¡¬245_patent during reexamination triggered intervening rights with respect to those claims
under hemcons view substantive_change applies especially to claims 6 7 10 11 and 17 which reciting no numerical result in any biocompatibility_test are generic in that respect
furthermore hemcon argues that even claims_12_and_20 were substantially changed in scope when the examiner adopted the district_courts construction of` biocompatible' during reexamination despite the fact that those claims have at all times required an elution_test_score of zero corresponding to` no signs of cellular reactivity' on that test ¡¬245_patent col.42 ll.39-40
hemcon argues that while claims_12_and_20 specified no reactivity on the elution_test prior to reexamination they nevertheless covered products exhibiting slight_reactivity on other biocompatibility_tests until marine_polymer successfully pressed the more restrictive` no detectable_biological_reactivity' construction during reexamination.6

marine_polymer disagrees and argues that intervening rights can not apply with respect to claims that have not been amended or newly introduced in the reexamination_proceeding.7

the doctrine of intervening rights first developed as courts recognized that permitting substantive_changes to the scope of patent_claims through post-issuance procedures left` the door.. open for gross_injustice' where a third_party having already begun to make use or sell a given article finds its previously lawful_activities rendered newly infringing under a modified patent

in such_situations the defendant` acquired at least a right to continue to use the [ articles ] as if it held a license therefor under the reissued_patent'
id.at 294-95 60_s.ct._961 quoting ashland fire brick co. v. gen. refractories co. 27_f.2d_744 746 6th cir.1928
with respect to reissued_patents the concept of intervening rights was codified by the patent_act of 1952 and the statute provides for two types of intervening rights 1 intervening *1362 rights that abrogate liability for infringing claims added to or modified from the original_patent if the accused products were made or used before the reissue often referred to as absolute intervening rights ; and 2 intervening rights that apply as a matter of judicial discretion to mitigate liability for infringing such claims even as to products made or used after the reissue if the accused infringer made substantial_preparations for the infringing activities prior to reissue often referred to as equitable intervening rights
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 252 2006
intervening rights do not accrue however where the accused product or activity infringes a claim that existed in the original_patent and remains` without substantive_change' after reissue
seattle box co. v. indus
crating & packing inc. 731_f.2d_818 827-28 fed.cir.1984

although intervening rights originated as a defense against patents modified through reissue procedures the doctrine has since been extended to the context of patent reexamination
pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 307 b and 316 b respectively both ex parte and inter partes reexaminations can give rise to intervening rights
for example ¡± 307 b provides as follows any proposed amended or new_claim determined to be patentable and incorporated into a patent following a reexamination_proceeding will have the same_effect as that specified in section 252 of this title for reissued_patents on the right of any person who made purchased or used within the united_states or imported into the united_states anything patented by such proposed amended or new_claim or who made substantial_preparation for the same prior to issuance of a certificate under the provisions of subsection a of this section
35 u.s.c.¡± 307 b emphasis added8 thus after a patent emerges from reexamination the statute makes available absolute and equitable intervening rights to the same extent provided in the reissue statute but only with respect to` amended or new' claims in the reexamined_patent

with regard to hemcons intervening rights_argument we must first note that the reexamination of the ¡¬245_patent was a separate and distinct proceeding that is not properly before us on appeal
it did not conclude until after trial so the district_court did not consider nor could it have considered the reexamination in rendering its judgment
the panel noted that the issue of intervening rights arose after the district_court judgment but concluded that it had the discretion to consider that issue on appeal because it was an event as to which judicial_notice is appropriate
exercising that discretion the panel held that in light of its reversal of the district_courts claim_construction hemcon is entitled to intervening rights and that the district_courts judgment of infringement therefore must be reversed

although we reject the premise of hemcons argument regarding intervening rights-that the district_courts claim_construction prior to reexamination of the ¡¬245_patent was erroneous-we conclude as an alternative_ground for decision that even if the district_courts claim_construction was erroneous hemcons intervening *1363 rights_argument must fail because it disregards the plain and unambiguous language of ¡± 307 b
section 307 b governs intervening rights arising from ex parte_reexamination and specifies that only` amended or new' claims incorporated into a patent during reexamination` will have the same_effect as that specified in section 252' i.e. will be susceptible to intervening rights
hemcon ignores this threshold statutory requirement and asks that we proceed directly to the subsidiary` substantive_change' analysis which derives from ¡± 252
see kaufman co. v. lantech inc. 807_f.2d_970 975-77 fed.cir.1986 explaining the relationship between ¡±¡± 252_and_307 b and holding that` identical' as used in ¡± 252 means` without substantive_change'
but under ¡± 307 b the first question when assessing whether intervening rights arose from a reexamination is whether the asserted claim is` amended or new' ; if the answer is no that ends the inquiry
only if the claim at issue is new or has been amended may the court proceed to the second_step in the analysis and assess the substantive effect of any such change pursuant to ¡± 252

such a framework is consistent with our holding in laitram
there our focus rested on whether the claims had been substantively changed precisely because the claims had been changed-there was no question that the claims at issue had been amended in reexamination so the dispute centered on the second_step in the intervening rights analysis viz. whether those literal amendments to the claim_language had effected substantive_changes in claim_scope
see laitram 163 f.3d at 1344` the parties dispute whether the scope of the original_claims was substantively changed following several amendments made during the reexamination of the..
patent'
( emphasis added
in contrast the patent_claims asserted here against hemcon were neither` new' nor` amended' -claims 6 7 10-12 17 and 20 contained identical_language before and after reexamination
¡¬245_patent col.72_ll.5-16 25-35 50-54 60-61 ; ¡¬245_reexam

whether or not marine_polymers arguments to the examiner and cancellation of claims during reexamination may have affected the remaining claims effective_scope they did not` amend' those claims for intervening rights_purposes or make them` new' which is what the statutory_language requires
intervening rights are therefore unavailable under ¡± 307 b as a matter of law

hemcon sidesteps this issue by emphasizing the well-recognized principle that arguments made during prosecution can affect the ultimate_meaning of a claim_term-and thus the` scope' of a claim-and then returning to its contention that intervening rights turn on whether claim_scope changes during reexamination
hemcon thus posits that marine_polymers actions in reexamination rendered the asserted_claims effectively` amended' by disavowal or estoppel even though the language of the claims was not formally changed
we disagree

while it is true that claims are properly interpreted to account for arguments and concessions made during prosecution hemcons conclusion that the claims asserted here were` amended' for purposes of ¡± 307 b goes too far
in general parlance` amend' means` to alter.. formally by adding deleting or rephrasing'
american heritage college dictionary 42-43 3d ed
1997
and even if the term were ambiguous standing alone any doubts are resolved by its context within ¡± 307

section 307 a identifies three categories of claims in a reexamined *1364 patent 1 claims that existed in the original_patent but have been cancelled as unpatentable 2 claims that existed in the original_patent and have been confirmed as patentable and 3 amended or new_claims that did not exist in the original_patent but have been found to be patentable and will be incorporated into the patent by the pto.9 in providing for intervening rights ¡± 307 b is limited to the third category of claims as evidenced by its corresponding reference to any` amended or new_claim' that is` incorporated into a patent'
any interpretation of` amended' that includes disavowal or disclaimer by argument alone as advocated by hemcon would conflict with the rest of ¡± 307 for it is difficult to envision how arguments about claim meaning could be` incorporated into a patent' by the director of the pto
finally it is clear that` amended' is a term of art in patent prosecution,10 including reexamination_proceedings,11 and in that context connotes formal changes to the actual_language of a claim
we thus can not agree that a claim can be` amended' for purposes of ¡± 307 b without changing the claim_language itself

hemcon also expresses concern that excluding its concept of amendment by argument from the ambit of ¡± 307 b would` create a significant loophole' in the intervening rights_defense-shrewd patentees would simply opt to rely on arguments rather than amendments to effectively change and thereby preserve otherwise invalid claims during reexamination without engendering intervening rights against those claims
reply br
for defendant-appellant at 25 2011_wl_287045

we believe that is highly unlikely
if in reexamination an examiner determines that particular claims are invalid and need amendment to be allowable one would expect an examiner to require amendment rather than accept argument alone
indeed congress may well have expected that changes in claim_scope during reexamination would ordinarily be made by amendment which would avoid the risk of creating a loophole in the intervening rights_defense
moreover if an argument does suffice to overcome a rejection it is probably because the claims at issue are not unallowable
thus the fear of gamesmanship does not persuade us to rule contrary to the plain_meaning of the statute
various amici have in fact pointed out that such gamesmanship concerns run both ways suggesting that hemcons interpretation of ¡± 307 b if adopted would invite putative infringers to initiate reexamination_proceedings with marginal or noninvalidating prior_art
under hemcons rule such a requestor could expect that even if *1365 the reexamination ultimately confirms all claims as patentable without amendment the patent_owner will necessarily make substantive arguments in defending the claims thereby allowing the requestor to allege intervening rights based on those arguments
in any event we can not and will not speculate about possible consequences with respect to situations not before us and which we can not foresee

the dissent criticizes our discussion of hemcons intervening rights_defense at length asserting that this important_issue has been addressed only in dictum by the en banc court
however because the original opinion dealt extensively with this issue we must now decide the case as we find it and clarify the law

regarding the clause in ¡± 307 b restricting intervening rights to` amended or new' claims the dissent relies heavily on analogy to other_fields of law
while prior experience may at times be helpful in statutory_interpretation references to scattered permissive applications of the term` amended' to e.g. a product safety regulation and a private contract are of limited utility in interpreting the specific patent statute before us
clear statutory_language and the long understanding of practitioners in a field trump interpretations from other_fields
furthermore the dissent selectively quotes from amicus_briefs arguing for a flexible interpretation of the intervening rights_statute but other amici argue for giving the statutory_language its plain_meaning
clearly nothing conclusive can be gleaned from the amicus_briefs but we in addition to relying primarily on our own analysis are more persuaded by those arguing for a faithful reading of the statutory text

the dissent makes a brief attempt to call upon the supreme_court to support its view but the quoted language of the court was that a specification` be substantially changed either by the addition of new_matter or the omission of important_particulars so as to enlarge the scope of the invention as originally claimed'
russell v. dodge 93_u.s._460 463-64 23_l.ed._973_(1876)
such language does not control this case which does not deal with the introduction of new_matter or the omission of important_particulars so as to enlarge the scope of the invention as originally claimed
the claims remaining in the patent are the same as originally claimed

in sum the plain directive of the governing statute before us does not permit hemcon to invoke intervening rights against claims that the pto confirmed on reexamination to be patentable as originally issued
to be sure patent_applicants actions and arguments during prosecution including prosecution in a reexamination_proceeding can affect the proper interpretation and effective_scope of their claims
but in rejecting hemcons request for intervening rights we are not here interpreting claims
rather we are interpreting a statute that provides for intervening rights following reexamination only as to` amended or new' claims
the asserted_claims of the ¡¬245_patent are neither

conclusion
accordingly the final_judgment of the district_court is affirmed

affirmed

dyk circuit_judge dissenting in part with whom gajarsa reyna and wallach circuit_judges join in full and with whom linn circuit_judge joins in parts_i-ii
the court took this case en banc to address when absolute intervening rights arise under 35 u.s.c.¡± 307 b during reexamination
in particular the question is whether intervening rights accrue when *1366 the patentee limits the claim_scope by argument rather than by formal_amendment to the claim_language

despite the importance of the issue of intervening rights as evidenced by the amicus_briefs filed by numerous companies and organizations the court did not seek further briefing and argument by the parties
this approach to an important_issue is in my view difficult to justify
now remarkably the court having affirmed the district_courts judgment by an equally divided court goes on to opine in dictum as to the issue of intervening rights even though that issue as discussed below has been resolved by the affirmance and also in the majoritys view` is not properly before us on appeal'
maj. op.at 1362
this is an unusual and unfortunate approach to an important_issue
this issue is likely to become even more important under the new leahy-smith america invents act` aia' because of the increased availability of reexamination
the majoritys interpretation of the statute is both incorrect and certain to encourage improper strategic behavior by patent_applicants

the starting point for an intervening rights determination is the meaning of the original claim_language
the district_court construed the key claim limitation` biocompatible' of the original_patent_claims to require` polymers.. with low_variability high_purity and no detectable_biological_reactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests'
marine_polymer_techs. inc. v. hemcon inc. no._06-_cv-100-jd 2008_wl_1995454 at *10 d.n.h
may_6,_2008 emphasis added
contrary to judge_louries opinion it seems to me that the district_courts construction was palpably incorrect and inconsistent with our established claim_construction jurisprudence

some background is essential to an understanding of the claim_construction issue
marine_polymer asserted seven claims of u.s. patent no._6864,245` the ¡¬245_patent` directed to p-glcnac_polymers against hemcon
independent_claim 6 is representative and claims` a biocompatible [ p-glcnac polymer ] comprising up to about 150,000 n-acetylglucosamine_monosaccharides covalently attached in a £]-1¡÷4_conformation and having a molecular_weight of up to about 30 million daltons in which at least one n-acetylglucosamine_monosaccharide has been deacetylated'
¡¬245_pat
col.72_ll.5-10 emphasis added
marine_polymer acknowledges that p-glcnac_polymers had been disclosed in the prior_art
the polymer also exists in nature in chitin the chief organic structural component in the cell walls of fungi or algae and the protective shells of insects and crustaceans but had been difficult to isolate with high_purity and low_variability
the ¡¬245_patent purported to disclose for the first time a` biocompatible' polymer in a purified form along with methods for its purification from microalgae
with sufficient purity these polymers have a number of biomedical_applications including inter_alia as a means for the rapid control of severe blood loss
a purified polymer provides` increased effectiveness reduced toxicity and improved bioavailability' for its biomedical_applications
id
col.5 ll.3-4

there are substantial questions as to whether the prior_art disclosed the claimed invention
that depends in significant part on the construction of the term` biocompatible' a term existing in each of the asserted_claims
as noted above the district_court construed` biocompatible' p- *1367 glcnac to be limited to` polymers.. with.. no detectable_biological_reactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests'
marine_polymer 2008_wl_1995454 at *10 emphasis added

one might at the outset be somewhat skeptical of this construction because it was not proposed by either party and was indeed contrary to the patentees own proposed construction
in the district_court marine_polymer conceded that` biocompatible_p-glcnac' could exhibit some biological_reactivity arguing that the term should be interpreted to mean` biomedically pure [ p-glcnac ] that reproducibly exhibits acceptably low_levels of adverse_bioreactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests'

similarly it argued in its memorandum that its sample p-glcnac` showed acceptably low adverse reactions' to each of the biocompatibility_tests and that this construction of` biocompatible_p-glcnac' was` fully supported' by the claims and specification

whether or not marine_polymers own constructions are binding,1 the district_courts construction is in fact contrary to the specification and to the claims themselves
the specification and claims are clear that` biocompatible' p-glcnac encompasses polymers that exhibit some biological_reactivity
the specification` is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term' phillips v. awh_corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1315 fed.cir.2005 en banc and may define a term explicitly or by implication irdeto access inc. v. echostar satellite corp. 383_f.3d_1295 1300 fed.cir.2004

here the specification defines` biocompatible' in a manner directly contrary to the district_courts construction of` no detectable_biological_reactivity'
the specification first discusses the concept of biocompatibility in the detailed description of the invention stating that` [ t ] he p-glcnac of the invention exhibits a high_degree of biocompatibility'
¡¬245_pat
col.10 ll.49-50
the specification does not provide at this point what constitutes an acceptably high_degree of biocompatibility but it discloses that` [ b ] iocompatability may be determined by a variety of techniques including but not limited to such procedures as the elution_test intramuscular_implantation or intracutaneous or systemic injection into animal subjects'
id
col.10 ll.50-53
each of these four` biocompatibility_tests' is later described in detail including the particular materials methods and conditions to properly perform each test on a p-glcnac sample
the specification also discusses the results of each of the four tests and specifically defines what constitutes` meet [ ing ]' the requirements of the particular` biocompatibility_test'
see id
col.42 ll.42-43
judge_louries opinion itself concedes that the specification contemplates non-zero` passing' scores on the biocompatibility_tests
see lourie_op.at 1358-59

notably for each of the four tests the specification does not require that there be no biological_reactivity but provides that the test is satisfied where at least some reactivity is present
for example with respect to the elution_test the specification states that` [ t ] he test_article i.e. p- *1368 glcnac meets the biocompatibility_test if none of the cultures treated with the test_article show a greater than mild_reactivity'
¡¬245_pat
col.42 ll.41-43 emphasis added
likewise the specification explains that the biocompatibility_test using the other_methods is met even if the polymer exhibits some biological_reactivity
see id
col.43 ll.54-60 col.44 ll.25-26 col.45 ll.41-43
nowhere does the specification disavow or disclaim from the scope of the claims polymers exhibiting these levels of reactivity
if a polymer exhibiting some reactivity nonetheless meets the specifications explicit requirements for` biocompatibility' it can not be that such polymer is not` biocompatible' within the meaning of the claims
thus the specification contemplates some level of reactivity that is compatible with use in biomedical_applications

if this description of biocompatibility in the specification were not enough the presence of six independent_claims in the original_patent dictate that the` biocompatible' limitation allow some exhibition of reactivity
six dependent_claims in the original_patent specifically required that the` biocompatible' p-glcnac have an elution_test_score of either one or two which correspond to` slight' or` mild' reactivity respectively and is directly inconsistent with a construction requiring no reactivity
¡¬245_pat
col.42 ll.50-55
if` biocompatible' requires that there be no reactivity but these dependent_claims require slight or mild_reactivity they are nullified and become utterly meaningless
marine_polymer itself concedes that these six claims were rendered meaningless by the district_courts construction and that` the dependent_claims requiring non-zero elution_test_scores conflict with [ the district_courts ] construction'
appellees br

where a particular construction of an independent claim would nullify claims that depend from it the doctrine of claim_differentiation creates a presumption that such a construction is improper
see liebel-flarsheim co. v. medrad inc. 358_f.3d_898 910 fed.cir.2004
we adopt a construction of a term which renders claims invalid or meaningless when it is the` only claim_construction that is consistent with the claims language and the written description'
rhine v. casio inc. 183_f.3d_1342 1345 fed.cir.1999 emphasis added
in other_words this presumption can be overcome only where a contrary_construction is` dictated' -i.e. compelled-by the written description or prosecution_history
seachange_int l inc. v. c-cor inc. 413_f.3d_1361 1369 1370-72 fed.cir.2005 holding that the presumption established by claim_differentiation was rebutted because the written description` consistently' referred to the claim_term in a specific manner and arguments made during prosecution amounted to a clear and unambiguous_disclaimer of claim_scope
here there is an alternate claim_construction one construing` biocompatible' to mean` little or no detectable_reactivity' which preserves the validity of these six dependent_claims
nothing in the written description or prosecution_history overcomes the presumption by dictating or compelling the conclusion that` biocompatible' is limited to exhibiting` no detectable_reactivity'

in supporting the district_courts claim_construction judge_louries opinion ignores or dismisses much of this compelling evidence
the opinion suggests that the examiners adoption of the district_courts construction supports the correctness of that construction
lourie_op.at 1359_n._5
quite the contrary
during reexamination marine_polymer asked the examiner to adopt the district_courts construction of` biocompatible' in evaluating whether the *1369 claims were invalid as anticipated or obvious
the examiner however rejected the district_courts construction and held that the` biocompatibility' limitation was not limited to no reactivity but instead permitted` little or no detectable_reactivity'
j.a
39503
the examiner explained that this definition` avoids creating the situation where claims 4 5 13 14 21_and_22 would be improper for failing to further limit the claims from which they depend'
j.a
39504
only after these dependent_claims were canceled to create consistency with the district_courts construction of` biocompatible' did the examiner accept the district_courts construction
the examiner explained that` [ w ] ith the cancellation of the claims which required that the elution_test_scores were 1_or_2 the examiner now agrees with the courts definition of the term biocompatible'
j.a
39481

apart from its reliance on the examiner judge_louries opinion rests its conclusion as to the correctness of the district_courts construction almost exclusively on the fact that there are two instances in the entire specification where it refers to the p-glcnac` of the invention'
see lourie_op.at 1357-59
these two references however do not limit the scope of the term` biocompatible'
with respect to the first discussed above the specification simply notes that the` p-glcnac of the invention exhibits a high_degree of biocompatibility'
¡¬245_pat
col.10 ll.49-50 emphasis added
there is no indication in the specification that a high_degree of biocompatibility is achieved only where there is no reactivity
the passage suggests the opposite
with respect to the second the specifications description of the p-glcnac` of the invention' was made in the context of a specific example-one of eighteen in the specification
judge_louries opinion leaves out highly pertinent language in quoting this portion of the specification
the specification explicitly states that
[ i ] n this example.. the p-glcnac of the invention exhibits no detectable_biological_reactivity
id
col.41 ll.66-67 emphasis added
judge_louries opinion leaves out the` in this example' language
this reference does not suggest that the invention always` exhibits no detectable_biological_reactivity' ; rather that it does so` in this example
`` 2 the mere fact that the p-glcnac tested in this example in the specification showed no biological_reactivity without more can not be sufficient to limit the claim_term` biocompatible' to polymers exhibiting no detectable_biological_reactivity

the approach in judge_louries opinion of interpreting a claim limitation based solely on a single_example from the specification is an approach we have repeatedly rejected
see e.g. silicon graphics inc. v. ati techs. inc. 607_f.3d_784 792 fed.cir.2010` a construing courts reliance on the specification must not go so far as to import limitations into claims from examples or embodiments appearing only in a patents written description unless the specification makes clear that the patentee intends for the claims and the embodiments in the specification to be *1370 strictly coextensive'
( internal_quotation_marks omitted ; howmedica osteonics corp. v. wright med
tech. inc. 540_f.3d_1337 1345 fed.cir.2008` [ w ] e have repeatedly held that the fact that the specification describes only a single_embodiment standing alone is insufficient to limit otherwise broad claim_language`
we have` cautioned against limiting the claimed invention to preferred embodiments or specific examples in the specification'
tex instruments inc. v. u.s. int l trade comm n 805_f.2d_1558 1563 fed.cir.1986
indeed the` [ v ] aried use of a disputed term in the written description demonstrates the breadth of the term rather than providing a limited definition'
johnson worldwide assocs. inc. v. zebco corp. 175_f.3d_985 991 fed.cir.1999
this court has never on such scant evidence as exists here found that a single_embodiment disclosed in a patent limited the scope of the claims

judge_louries new approach to claim_construction would enable patentees to eliminate questions of validity by narrowing claims in accordance with a preferred embodiment or single_example while also allowing alleged infringers to narrow claims beyond their valid scope to avoid infringement
that approach can not be correct

ii
under the correct_claim_construction ignoring for a moment the issue of intervening rights hemcon at a minimum would be entitled to a new_trial on all issues related to the validity of the original_patent_claims
the jury was specifically instructed under the incorrect_claim_construction and answered questions on the jury_verdict form directly related to this construction
j.a
111 asking jury whether prior_art discloses` having no detectable_biological_reactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests'
moreover after trial the district_court denied hemcons motion for jmol and/or a new_trial on anticipation and obviousness because hemcons experts opinions about the prior_art` were based on the wrong definition of biocompatibility' marine_polymer_techs. inc. v. hemcon inc. no._06-_cv-100-jd 2010_wl_2902258 at *3 d.n.h
july_21,_2010 and because the disputed prior_art` did not disclose p-glcnac with no detectable_biological_reactivity as determined by biocompatibility_tests' id.at *4
see also id.at *8` [ b ] ecause none of the cited prior_art disclosed the properties of biocompatible_p-glcnac as claimed by the ¡¬ 245 patent the evidence at trial did not support findings for obviousness`
this reliance on this incorrect_claim_construction alone warrants a new_trial on these issues putting to one side the issue of intervening rights
hemcon should at a minimum be permitted to defend itself against claims of infringing the original_patent by attacking its validity under a proper claim_construction

iii
a. i turn then to the question of intervening rights
while the judgment of the district_court is affirmed by an equally divided court the district_court rendered no judgment on the question of intervening rights and therefore there is nothing to affirm in that respect
nonetheless i agree with judge_lourie that the effect of the equally divided affirmance is that the district_courts claim_construction is binding on the parties as if the district_courts decision had never been reviewed
*1371 durant v. essex co. 7_wall._107 74_u.s._107 113 19_l.ed._154_(1868) holding that an affirmance by an equally divided court` is as conclusive and binding in every respect upon the parties as if rendered upon the concurrence of all the judges upon every question involved in the case'3 the result is that there can be no intervening rights
in other_words under the district_courts incorrect_claim_construction now binding on the parties as a result of the affirmance of the district_courts judgment the original and reexamined_claims are identical in scope and there is thus no issue of intervening rights and no need for the majority to offer` an alternative_ground for decision'
remarkably the majority goes on to legislate an interpretation of the intervening rights_statute
this is to say the least an unusual approach
it is particularly odd because the majority thinks that the issue is not properly before us even if the district_courts claim_construction was wrong because the intervening rights_issue was not addressed by the district_court

in my view the issue is properly before us
here while the district_court entered judgment on september 22 2010 and hemcon filed its notice of appeal to this court on september 24 2010 the examiner did not issue the notice of intent to issue an ex parte reexamination certificate until november 3 2010 well after the appeal to this court
the majority offers no reasons why we should not consider the changes to a patent effected by reexamination
just as we are obligated to take account of intervening changes in law that affect an appeal see bradley v. sch
bd

ample authority uncontradicted by the majority supports the original_panels approach of addressing the issue of intervening rights,4 and the majority has offered no support for its position that a court can not take judicial_notice of changes that occur while the case is pending on appeal

the majority though believing that the issue is not properly before us and that the issue is resolved by the district_courts claim_construction excuses its discussion of intervening rights by the fact that the original_panel opinion` dealt extensively *1372 with this issue' and thus this court must` decide the case as we find it and clarify the law'
maj. op.at 1365
but the panel opinion has been vacated and if the issue is not in fact properly before us and is unnecessary in any event there is no possible reason for addressing it
if this were not enough the supreme_court has repeatedly counseled against writing opinions where a judgment has been affirmed by an equally divided court,5 a practice that the majority here disregards

b
on the merits of the intervening rights_issue the majority is incorrect as a matter of statutory_interpretation
section 307 b provides any proposed amended or new_claim determined to be patentable and incorporated into a patent following a reexamination_proceeding will have the same_effect as that specified in section 252 of this title for reissued_patents on the right of any person who made purchased or used within the united_states or imported into the united_states anything patented by such proposed amended or new_claim or who made substantial_preparation for the same prior to issuance of a certificate under the provisions of subsection a of this section
35 u.s.c.¡± 307 b emphasis added
section 307 b thus specifically incorporates the intervening rights_provisions of reissued_patents found in section 252
congress was explicit that section 307 b should be interpreted to be identical in scope to section 252 subsection 307 b provides intervening rights similar to those provided by patent law section 252 with respect to reissued_patents
thus a person practicing a patented_invention would not be considered an infringer for the period between issuance of an invalid patent and its conversion through reexamination to a valid patent
h.r.rep
no._96-1307 i at 8 1980 1980_u.s.c.c.a.n._6460 6467 emphasis added6 thus the` amended or new' language *1373 in section 307 b was clearly intended to have the same meaning as` substantially identical' in section 252
the focus is on whether the old and new_claims are` substantially identical'
in another case analyzing intervening rights related to a reexamined_patent this court explained

a patentee of a reexamined_patent is entitled to infringement damages inter_alia for the period between the date of issuance of the original_claims and the date of issuance of the reexamined_claims if the original and reexamined_claims are` identical'
reexamined claims are` identical' to their original counterparts if they are` without substantive_change'
furthermore in determining whether substantive_changes have been made we must discern whether the scope of the claims are identical not merely whether different words are used
laitram_corp. v. nec_corp. 163_f.3d_1342 1346 fed.cir.1998 internal citations omitted first and third emphases added
here the original and new_claims are not` substantially identical'
during reexamination the patentee agreed by both argument and by amending the claims to cancel six dependent_claims that the term` biocompatible' should be construed to mean` no detectable_biological_reactivity'
in doing so as discussed above the patentee adopted a construction that was different than the correct construction of the original_claims namely that` biocompatible' meant inter_alia` little or no detectable_reactivity'
the effect was to narrow the claims and protect them from a finding of invalidity

as the majority recognizes see maj. op.at 1363-64 it is well established that statements during prosecution or reexamination of a patent as well as additions or deletions of claims to overcome rejections can change the meaning of a claim_term that would ordinarily be construed otherwise
see am
piledriving_equip. inc. v. geoquip inc. 637_f.3d_1324 1336 fed.cir.2011 ; cias inc. v. alliance gaming corp. 504_f.3d_1356 1362-63 fed.cir.2007 ; c.r

here although identical in language the claims of the patent after reexamination were not identical in scope for purposes of intervening rights because they were` substantively changed' during reexamination

the majority makes much of the difference in language between sections 307 b and 252 pointing out that section 307 b includes the language` amended or new_claims'
the majority limits an` amended' claim under section 307 b to a situation in which the claim_language itself is changed
this interpretation ignores the statutes language its purpose and the history of intervening rights

because the statute does not define` amended' this term is` assumed to bear [ its ]ordinary contemporary common meaning

while` amend' may often connote an actual change in language,7 that is not the only meaning of the term` amend'

*1374 there are a number of cases decided in similar contexts that make clear that a written document can be` amended' without a language_change
for example national_knitwear manufacturers ass n v. consumer_product_safety_commission 666_f.2d_81_(4th_cir.1981) is quite similar to this case
in national_knitwear the flammable fabrics act required the consumer_product_safety_commission to comply with specific procedures in addition to those under the administrative_procedure_act in order to issue` a new or amended flammability standard'
15 u.s.c.¡± 1193 1976 emphasis added
the flammability_standards for childrens sleepwear included a definition of` [ c ] hildrens [ s ] leepwear' that specifically excluded` underwear'
16 c.f.r.¡± 1615.1 a 1980
thereafter the commission issued a statement without complying with the act indicating that` despite a garments being labeled as underwear and unsuitable for sleepwear the commission may bring an enforcement action if it believes that the garment is intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or that it has been promoted as sleepwear'
nat l knitwear 666 f.2d at 83
the fourth circuit held that the act had been violated because although the text of the flammability_standards had not changed` the commission ha [ d ] in effect amended the standard despite the express exclusion of underwear from the definition of sleepwear'
id.at 84 emphasis added
just as the standard in national_knitwear was` amended' by an agency statement so here the claims have been` amended' by a disclaimer in the reexamination

in many other contexts the word` amend' has been interpreted as not requiring an explicit language_change
in the context of the administrative_procedure_act amending an interpretive rule can be considered` amending.. a rule' under section 551 5 thus requiring notice and comment even if there is no alteration in the language of the rule itself
united_states v. magnesium corp. of am. 616_f.3d_1129 1139 10th cir.2010
as the tenth circuit has held` if an agency amends its interpretation of a rule it is effectively amending the rule itself'

legal instruments can often be constructively or effectively amended without changing literal text
see e.g. chamberlain group inc. v. skylink techs. inc. 381_f.3d_1178 1189 fed.cir.2004` for the purpose of determining federal circuit jurisdiction we do not differentiate between actual and constructive_amendments [ to the complaint ]

a statute may also be amended without a change in language
see united_states ex rel
palmer v. lapp 244_f._377_(6th_cir.1917) finding that an act independent *1375 and original in form which in effect added a provision to an existing statute was an` amendment' within the meaning of a reference in another act to that statute` and amendments thereto'
in general an act that changes the substance of a statute without changing its language is commonly referred to as an` amendment by implication'
see united_states v. welden 377_u.s._95 103_n._12 84_s.ct._1082 12_l.ed.2d_152_(1964) ; agri processor co. v. nlrb 514_f.3d_1 4 d.c.cir.2008
thus the plain language of the term` amended' does not require a language_change

the history of intervening rights_provisions themselves compel an interpretation of` amended' that does not require a change in the language of the claims
the doctrine of intervening rights with respect to reissued_patents existed as a judicial construct since the 1800s
see generally p.j
federico intervening_rights in patent reissues 30 geo
wash. l. rev
603 1961
section 252 in the patent_act of 1952 substantially adopted and clarified the doctrine of intervening rights as it had been interpreted and developed by the courts
see h.r.rep
no._82-1923 at 8 1952 ; see also federico supra at 629-30
courts for years have understood that the specification and the claims together act to define an invention
the supreme_court recognized that the scope of patents could be changed by an amendment to the specification where there is no formal_amendment to the claim
see e.g. russell v. dodge 93_u.s._460 463 23_l.ed._973_(1876) noting that a specification might` be substantially changed either by the addition of new_matter or the omission of important_particulars so as to enlarge the scope of the invention as originally claimed'

the supreme_court made clear that a change in the specification broadening the scope of the patent just as a change to claim_language could lead to intervening rights
for example in battin v. taggert the court noted that
[ w ] hether the defect be in the specifications or in the claim.. the patentee may surrender his patent and by an amended specification or claim cure the defect..
but where the specification or claim is made so vaguely as to be inoperative and invalid yet an amendment may give to it validity and protect the rights of the patentee against all subsequent infringements
58_u.s._74 83 17_how._74 15_l.ed._37_(1854) emphasis added
similarly in a case where a patentee had amended the specification during reissue by inter_alia inserting an additional figure one court held that` [ t ] he law does not permit such an enlargement of the original specifications as will interfere with other inventors who have acquired intervening rights'
ficklen v. baker 47 app
d.c. 587 596 d.c.cir.1918 quoting manly v. williams 37 app
d.c. 194 201 d.c.cir.1911
thus prior to congress enacting the intervening rights_provisions of section 252 courts understood that not having a change in claim_language was not indispensible to creating intervening rights and that a change in the specification could also lead to intervening rights
contrary to the majoritys assertion i do not claim that these cases directly control this case
they do however make clear that the supreme_court in developing the doctrine of intervening rights concluded that the scope of the claims could change without formal_amendments and still require the recognition of intervening rights
there is no indication in the legislative history of section 252 that congress intended to overrule the courts understanding on this *1376 point
see h.r.rep
no._82-1923
as noted section 307 added in 1980 was explicitly designed to provide` similar' intervening rights as those provided in section 252
id
if a change in the language of the specification could result in an` amended' claim it is difficult to see why a change in claim_scope achieved by argument can not also result in an amended claim.8

most important we must interpret` amended' to effectuate the intent of congress in enacting the intervening rights_provisions of the reexamination statutes
see reves v. ernst & young 494_u.s._56 62-63 110_s.ct._945 108_l.ed.2d_47_(1990)` thus the phraseany note should not be interpreted to mean literallyany note but must be understood against the backdrop of what congress was attempting to accomplish in enacting the securities acts`
if` amended' only refers to changes in the actual_language of the claims the purpose of intervening rights will be plainly and directly thwarted

it is initially important to understand that the majority agrees that claim_scope can be changed by arguments made by the patentee during reexamination.9 in other_words the fundamental assumption of the majority is that even where argument in the reexamination_proceeding changes the scope of the claim there are no intervening rights unless there is a formal_amendment to the claim
what the majority does not tell us-in large part because it chooses to address this issue in dictum without applying the rule to this case-is whether when there is a change in claim_scope without formal_amendment 1 the changed claim_scope is retroactive to validate the patent as of its original issue date or 2 the accused infringer can still challenge the validity of the patent during the pre-examination period

neither of these alternatives makes sense and each directly contradicts the purpose of the statute thus demonstrating *1377 the error in the majoritys statutory_interpretation
the first alternative-retroactively validating the original_patent by changing its scope-leads to an unfair and absurd result
as recognized by the majority this is precisely the unfairness that led to the development of the doctrine of intervening rights in the first place
see maj. op.at 1361` the doctrine of intervening rights first developed as courts recognized that permitting substantive_changes to the scope of patent_claims through post-issuance procedures leftthe door.. open for gross_injustice where a third_party having already begun to make use or sell a given article finds its previously lawful_activities rendered newly infringing under a modified patent'
( quoting sontag_chain_stores_co. v. nat l_nut_co. 310_u.s._281 293-95 60_s.ct._961 84_l.ed._1204_(1940) emphasis added
the intervening rights_provisions make clear that the reexamined and changed claims are valid only for the future after reexamination
as noted in bloom engineering co. v. north american manufacturing co. sections 307_and_252 shield those who deem an adversely held patent to be invalid ; if the patentee later cures the infirmity by reissue or reexamination the making of substantive_changes in the claims is treated as an irrebuttable presumption that the original_claims were materially flawed
thus the statute relieves those who may have infringed the original_claims from liability during the period before the claims are validated
129_f.3d_1247 1249 fed.cir.1997 emphasis added
the second alternative-creating a judicial version of intervening rights-is even more directly contrary to the statute
congress having considered the doctrine of intervening rights can not have intended that the judiciary would develop a poor mans version of the doctrine to account for the statutes inadequate coverage
this strongly suggests that the statute should cover amendments by disclaimer

tellingly the amici who support the courts interpretation of the statute recognize that formal_amendments to claim_language during the course of reexamination are unusual
see amicus_br
of soverain et_al.at 10
telling too they admit that formal_amendments are now and will be avoided for the very_purpose of avoiding the creation of intervening rights
id.at 4 arguing that patent_owners often` follow a course of not seeking to amend their asserted_claims with the settled understanding that if they could avoid claim amendments they could also avoid intervening rights'
in other_words applicants will amend claims by argument rather than formal methods for the very_purpose of avoiding intervening rights

this very problem has led numerous amici to oppose the majoritys mechanical construction of the term` amend' and to recognize that the majoritys interpretation of intervening rights will create the very opportunities for mischief and` foster gamesmanship' that the statute was designed to avoid
amicus_br
of geico et_al.at 9-10` [ u ] nder such a rule patentees will be reluctant to change the words of their claims during reexamination or reissue and instead badger examiners with arguments changing the meaning of the words in the claims
`` ; amicus_br
of hewlett-packard co. et_al.at 11` appellees reading of the statute to exclude claims narrowed through disclaimer would lead to absurd results and discourage formal claim amendments in favor of prosecution_history maneuvering`
the majoritys construction of the statute defeats the public notice function of the patent system *1378 by encouraging patentees to define the scope of the invention outside of the claims themselves thus not apprising accused infringers of what is available to them

allowing patent_owners to avoid creating intervening rights by amending claims by argument is an abuse of the reexamination process and undermines the purpose of intervening rights
section 307 b can not be construed to sanction such abuses

to be sure not every argument during reexamination should give rise to intervening rights but intervening rights should be available where an argument during reexamination rises to the level of a clear and unambiguous_disclaimer or disavowal of the original correct_claim_construction
here marine_polymer clearly and unambiguously disclaimed the scope of its claim by effectively becoming its own lexicographer and presenting a specific limiting definition of the term` biocompatible
