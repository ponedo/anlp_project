background
schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disease affecting about one percent of the human population
despite extensive research the cause mechanism and etiology of schizophrenia remain unknown
individuals with schizophrenia suffer from positive_symptoms negative_symptoms and cognitive deficits
positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions
negative symptoms include flat affect poverty *1284 of speech inability to experience pleasure lack of desire to form relationships and lack of motivation

drugs that treat schizophrenia are called antipsychotics
the first antipsychotic_drug chlorpromazine was discovered by accident in the early 1950s
subsequent research revealed that chlorpromazines antipsychotic_properties were due to its antagonism blocking of dopamine receptors in the brain
that finding resulted in the development of other` typical' antipsychotics which treat positive_symptoms but not negative_symptoms and have a number of problematic side_effects including extrapyramidal symptoms` eps' tardive dyskinesia prolactin elevation hyperprolactinemia and sudden decrease in blood pressure orthostatic_hypotension
the united states food and drug_administration` fda' last approved a typical antipsychotic in 1975
despite their drawbacks typical_antipsychotics are still used today

researchers discovered clozapine in the early 1960s
clozapine was the first` atypical' antipsychotic in that it had a diminished propensity to cause eps and was useful for treating both positive and negative_symptoms of schizophrenia
clozapine had serious potential side_effects however including orthostatic_hypotension frank hypotension and agranulocytosis a life-threatening decrease in white blood cells
due to those side_effects clozapine was withdrawn from clinical_trials in the 1970s prompting scientists to seek an atypical antipsychotic_drug similar to clozapine with respect to efficacy but lacking its toxicity and side_effects
researchers efforts were largely unsuccessful however and the fda approved no new_antipsychotic_drugs between 1976_and_1989
the fda finally approved clozapine in 1990 but only for treatment-resistant or treatment-intolerant patients subject to rigorous blood testing

the fda approved risperidone the first postclozapine atypical antipsychotic in 1994
since then the fda has approved seven other_atypical_antipsychotics olanzapine 1996 ; quetiapine 1997 ; ziprasidone 2001 ; aripiprazole 2002 ; paliperidone 2007 ; asenapine 2009 ; and iloperidone 2009
although clozapine remains the` gold standard' with respect to efficacy the other_atypical_antipsychotics are considered at least as effective as typical_antipsychotics for treating positive_symptoms while also treating negative_symptoms and causing fewer eps side_effects
every fda-approved atypical antipsychotic has a chemical_structure related either to clozapine or risperidone with the sole exception of aripiprazole-the compound at issue in the present appeal

aripiprazole is the active_ingredient in the antipsychotic_drug marketed by otsuka_pharmaceutical_co. ltd.` otsuka' under the brand name abilifythe_r
the culmination of several decades of drug development efforts abilifythe_r was approved in 2002 by the fda and is marketed for the treatment of schizophrenia bipolar_disorder irritability associated with autistic_disorder in pediatric_patients and as an add-on treatment for depression
abilifythe_r has been commercially successful ; since 2005 its annual sales have exceeded a billion dollars and in 2009 its sales were $ 3.3 billion

aripiprazole has the chemical_name 7- { 4- [ 4- 2 3-dichlorophenyl -1-piperazinyl ] -butoxy } -3,4-dihydrocarbostyril and has the following_chemical_structure

aripiprazole is a` carbostyril_derivative' that is its chemical_structure contains a quinolinone fused ring labeled as` 3,4-dihydrocarbostyril' in the structure above
aripiprazoles carbostyril_ring is referred to as` 3,4-dihydro' because it has two hydrogen atoms not shown in the structure above connected to the 3_and_4 positions and thus has a single bond between these two carbon_atoms
in contrast a` carbostyril' moiety has only one hydrogen atom at the 3_and_4 positions and a resulting double_bond between the carbon_atoms
researchers refer to both variants as` carbostyril_derivatives'
connected to the 7-position of aripiprazoles carbostyril_core is a` butoxy_linker' consisting of four methylene -ch2- units
a` propoxy_linker' in contrast consists of only three methylene units
connected to aripiprazoles butoxy_linker is a piperazine_ring and a phenyl_ring

a patent is invalid if an alleged_infringer proves by clear and convincing_evidence that the differences between the claimed subject_matter and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art

obviousness is a question of law with underlying factual findings including 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent_art ; 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art ; and 4 objective_evidence such as commercial success long-felt need and the failure of others

i
we first address the defendants arguments that the district_court erred by failing to hold the asserted claims invalid for obviousness under ¡± 103.3

the defendants contend that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the prior_art carbostyril_derivative compounds at the time aripiprazole was invented
they assert that the lead_compound analysis applied by the district_court violates our precedent and` fall [ s ] into a rigid obviousness analysis precluded by ksr'
br
defs.appellants apotex at 35-36
in this regard the defendants allege that the court erred by assuming that` only the *1291 most obvious_choice could serve as a lead'
id.at 34
according to the defendants prior_art_compounds including the 2,3-dichloro propoxy the unsubstituted_butoxy and opc-4392 were known to have antipsychotic_activity and it would have been obvious to chemically modify them in the ways necessary to make aripiprazole
finally they argue that aripiprazoles properties and other secondary_considerations do not render aripiprazole nonobvious

otsuka in response argues that the district_court correctly rejected the defendants obviousness contentions which are based on improper hindsight bias
otsuka points out that no carbostyril_derivative had been shown to effectively treat schizophrenia as of the priority_date of the ¡¬528_patent
otsuka also contends that the district_court did not require proof that aripiprazole was the` most obvious' compound but rather evaluated all of the potential choices available to one of ordinary_skill and determined that the prior_art did not suggest that the unsubstituted_butoxy 2,3-dichloro propoxy or opc-4392 would be suitable lead_compounds
otsuka also asserts that secondary_considerations support the courts conclusion of nonobviousness

for the following reasons we hold that the district_court correctly determined that the defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted claims would have been obvious under ¡± 103

a
the district courts` lead compound' analysis
in cases involving the patentability of a new_chemical_compound prima_facie obviousness under the third_graham_factor generally turns on the structural similarities and differences between the claimed compound and the prior_art_compounds
daiichi sankyo co. v. matrix labs. ltd. 619_f.3d_1346 1352 fed.cir.2010
the defendants assert that the district_court erred by employing a` lead_compound' analysis as part of its determination under the third_graham_factor
we reject that contention
new compounds may be created from theoretical considerations rather than from attempts to improve on prior_art_compounds
in this case however the parties arguments focus on selecting and modifying particular_prior_art_compounds designated as lead_compounds

our case law demonstrates that whether a new_chemical_compound would have been prima_facie obvious over particular_prior_art_compounds ordinarily follows a two-part inquiry
first the court determines whether a chemist of ordinary_skill would have selected the asserted prior_art_compounds as lead_compounds or starting points for further_development_efforts
eisai co. v. dr. reddys labs. ltd. 533_f.3d_1353 1359 fed.cir.2008` [ p ] ost-ksr a prima_facie_case of obviousness for a chemical_compound still in general begins with the reasoned identification of a lead_compound`
a lead_compound as we have explained is` a compound in the prior_art that would be most promising to modify in order to improve upon its.. activity and obtain a compound with better activity'
takeda chem indus. ltd. v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1357 fed.cir.2007
as such a lead_compound is` a natural choice for further_development_efforts'
altana pharma ag v. teva_pharm
usa inc. 566_f.3d_999 1008 fed.cir.2009
in recent cases involving the alleged obviousness of a new_chemical_compound the parties have frequently focused upon the notion that a chemist must select one or more lead_compounds
e.g. daiichi 619 f.3d at 1352 ; altana 566 f.3d at 1007 ; procter & gamble_co. v. teva_pharm
*1292 usa inc. 566_f.3d_989 994 fed.cir.2009 ; eisai 533 f.3d at 1357 ; takeda 492 f.3d at 1357 ; eli_lilly & co. v. zenith goldline pharm. inc. 471_f.3d_1369 1379 fed.cir.2006 ; yamanouchi pharm co. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 231_f.3d_1339 1345 fed.cir.2000 ; cf

in such cases our analysis focuses on those proposed lead_compounds that the alleged_infringer has attempted to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the skilled_artisan would have had a reason to select from the panoply of known compounds in the prior_art
daiichi 619 f.3d at 1354

in determining whether a chemist would have selected a prior_art_compound as a lead the analysis is guided by evidence of the compounds pertinent_properties
see eli_lilly 471 f.3d at 1378 ; in re lalu 747_f.2d_703 707 fed.cir.1984
such properties may include positive attributes such as activity and potency altana 566 f.3d at 1008 ; eli_lilly 471 f.3d at 1379 ; yamanouchi 231 f.3d at 1345 ; adverse effects such as toxicity takeda 492 f.3d at 1358 and other relevant characteristics in evidence see eisai 533 f.3d at 1358 considering a prior_art_compounds lipophilicity and low molecular weight ; pfizer inc. v. apotex inc. 480_f.3d_1348 1363 fed.cir.2007 considering the` strength solubility and other known chemical characteristics' of a prior_art saltforming acid
absent a reason or motivation based on such prior_art evidence mere structural similarity between a prior_art_compound and the claimed compound does not inform the lead_compound selection
see daiichi 619 f.3d at 1354 ; in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692 fed.cir.1990 en banc` [ s ] tructural similarity between claimed and prior_art subject_matter proved by combining references or otherwise where the prior_art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions creates a prima_facie_case of obviousness'
( emphasis added
were it otherwise the analysis would impermissibly rely upon ex post_reasoning
see ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 421 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)` a factfinder should be aware of course of the distortion caused by hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post_reasoning
``

the second inquiry in the analysis is whether the prior_art would have supplied one of ordinary_skill in the art with a reason or motivation to modify a lead_compound to make the claimed compound with a reasonable_expectation of success
takeda 492 f.3d at 1357` [ i ] n cases involving new_chemical_compounds it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima_facie obviousness of a new claimed compound
`` ; pfizer 480 f.3d at 1361` [ t ] he challenger of the patent [ must ] show by clear and convincing_evidence that a skilled_artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art references to achieve the claimed invention and that the skilled_artisan would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so
`` ; dillon 919 f.2d at 692

in keeping with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry the reason or motivation for modifying a lead_compound may come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be explicit in the prior_art
eisai 533 f.3d at 1357 citing ksr 550 u.s. at 415 127_s.ct._1727 ; aventis pharma deutschland gmbh v. lupin ltd. 499_f.3d_1293 1301 fed.cir.2007
again pertinent_properties guide the analysis for` it is the possession of promising useful properties in a lead_compound *1293 that motivates a chemist to make structurally similar compounds'

in the present_case in assessing whether aripiprazole would have been prima_facie obvious in view of the prior_art_compounds asserted by the defendants the district_court summarized the applicable_law as requiring inquiry into
the hypothetical person of skill in the arts identification of a lead_compound structural_differences between the proposed lead_compound and the claimed invention motivation or teachings in the prior_art to make the necessary changes to arrive at the claimed invention and whether the person of skill in the art would have a reasonable_expectation of success in making such structural changes

lexis 132595 at *52-53
we discern no error in the district_courts recitation of the applicable_law
moreover the court did not require as the defendants allege that only` the most obvious_choice' could serve as the lead
rather the district_court concluded that two compounds-clozapine and risperidone-would have been considered viable lead_compounds
id.at *23-24 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *76
these were the only promising antipsychotic compounds at the time the present inventors began their work
they were the natural and obvious lead_compounds whose structures one would have considered to modify to obtain improved antipsychotic compounds
at the relevant time there were no carbostyril_compounds that were marketed as antipsychotics or were publicly known to have potent antipsychotic_activity with minimal side_effects
carbostyrils were thus not plausible lead_compounds except in retrospect and the district_court did not clearly err in concluding that they were not

as for the defendants purported lead_compounds the district_court carefully considered each compound and correctly rejected the contention that a skilled_artisan would have selected those compounds for further antipsychotic_drug research efforts

b
the unsubstituted butoxy compound
in evaluating the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art the district_court first considered the unsubstituted_butoxy_compound disclosed in the prior_art_¡¬416_patent and the nakagawa_declaration
the defendants contend that the court erred by finding that a skilled_artisan would not have selected the unsubstituted_butoxy as a lead_compound for antipsychotic_drug_discovery
we disagree

as the court noted the claims of the prior_art_¡¬416_patent explicitly disclose the unsubstituted_butoxy as producing an antihistaminic_effect
this clear teaching controls over the far more nebulous disclosure that the trillions of carbostyril_compounds encompassed by the ¡¬416_patent` have antihistaminic and central nervous controlling effects'
¡¬416_patent col.2 ll.50-51
as explained by dr. bryan roth whom the court credited as an expert in schizophrenia *1294 antipsychotic_drug_discovery and psychopharmacology one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have understood the ¡¬416_patents` laundry_list' of potential_central_nervous_system controlling effects to mean that every carbostyril_derivative disclosed in the ¡¬416_patent is a potential_antipsychotic
otsuka 2010_wl_4596324 at *8 *10 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *26 *31

the nakagawa_declaration similarly fails to support the defendants contentions
as an initial_matter otsuka argues in a footnote to its brief that the nakagawa_declaration is not eligible as prior_art because the defendants failed to prove that a chemist seeking to develop a new antipsychotic_drug would have consulted the unindexed file history of the prior_art_¡¬416_patent in the course of his or her research

see becton dickinson & co. v. c.r
bard inc. 922_f.2d_792 800 fed.cir.1990
we therefore assume without deciding that the nakagawa_declaration qualifies as prior_art

although nakagawas mouse_jumping_data` could be indicative of potential_antipsychotic_activity to the skilled_artisan' otsuka 2010_wl_4596324 at *10 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *34 that alone does not resolve the matter
rather we must consider the contents of the declaration as a whole as the district_court correctly did
in doing so we focus in particular on the compounds disclosed properties because as the district_court found` [ g ] enerally a skilled_artisan would be attracted to the most potent compounds in selecting a lead_compound for development'
id.at *17 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *54 ; see also daiichi 619 f.3d at 1354

of the nine carbostyril test compounds for which the nakagawa_declaration supplied mouse_jumping_data the unsubstituted_butoxy was inferior to four other test compounds and thus` was only of middling potency'
otsuka 2010_wl_4596324 at *20 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *65
significantly the four more potent test compounds were all propoxy-linked including compound 44 which with an ed 50_of_053 milligrams per kilogram` was by far the most potent of the compounds tested'
id.at *17 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *54
one of the defendants own experts conceded that the activity of compound 44 was` striking' and dr._roth testified that if a skilled_artisan were to select any compound from the nakagawa_declaration it would be compound 44
id.at *17 *17-18 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *54 *56
the defendants do not allege obviousness over the structurally dissimilar compound 44 which unlike aripiprazole has a propoxy_linker connected at the 5-position of its carbostyril_core and a 2-ethoxy substituent on its phenyl_ring
as the district_court found the nakagawa_declaration would if anything have taught one of ordinary_skill to select a 5-linked propoxy carbostyril_derivative as a lead_compound
see id.at *18 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *57 comparing the ed 50 value of 2.1 for a 5-linked unsubstituted_propoxy and the ed 50 value of 9.3 for a 7-linked unsubstituted_propoxy and finding that this` significant' difference` would teach the skilled_artisan the superiority of 5-linked propoxy_compounds over 7-linked propoxy_compounds'

thus neither the ¡¬416_patent nor the nakagawa_declaration supports the defendants position that one of ordinary_skill would have selected the prior_art unsubstituted *1295 butoxy compound as a lead_compound for further_antipsychotic_research

c. the 2,3-dichloro propoxy compound
according to the defendants the district_court erred by failing to find that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the se_¡¬945_application which taught that the 2,3-dichloro propoxy_compound had antipsychotic_activity
we disagree
the defendants argument` strains the scope of the se_¡¬945_application'
id.at *20 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *62
as the district_court correctly found the se_¡¬945_application lists the 2,3-dichloro propoxy_compound` as one among hundreds of examples that may be useful for an extensive list of potential_central_nervous_system controlling activities' id. and fails to tie the 2,3-dichloro propoxy to any meaningful_suggestion of antipsychotic_activity

the defendants citing pfizer 480_f.3d_1348 allege that the se_¡¬945_applications generic disclosure` is all that is required for obviousness'
br
defs.-appellants apotex at 37
in pfizer this court held that the claimed amlodipine besylate salt would have been obvious in view of the known chemical_structure of amlodipine and a prior_art group of salt-forming anions including benzene sulphonate which combines with amlodipine to form the besylate salt
pfizer 480 f.3d at 1372
this court premised its conclusion on findings that the prior_art not only provided` ample motivation to narrow the [ prior_art ] genus of.. salt-forming anions.. to a few [ species ]' id.at 1363 but also` predicted the results' id.at 1367
in the present_case in contrast to pfizer the defendants failed to make an analogous showing
the district_court thus correctly found that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have selected the 2,3-dichloro propoxy_compound as a lead_compound for further_antipsychotic_research

furthermore as otsuka points out the defendants theory that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the unsubstituted_butoxy and the 2,3-dichloro propoxy rested in large_part upon an asserted` bracketing theory' -i.e. that one would have combined those two asserted compounds to arrive at aripiprazole which shares some structural features of both
the district_court found that the defendants theory constituted` an improper hindsight analysis'
otsuka 2010_wl_4596324 at *20 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *64
the defendants do not on appeal challenge the district_courts finding or re-assert their bracketing theory
accordingly we conclude that the defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the 2,3-dichloro propoxy

d. opc-4392
the defendants also assert that the district_court erred by rejecting opc-4392 as a lead_compound
again we disagree
the defendants rely selectively on the disclosure in murasaki 1987 that opc-4392 was` an antipsychotic_drug' j.a
5907 and the fact that opc-4392 proceeded to phase ii clinical_trials
taken as a whole however the prior_art taught away from using opc-4392 as a starting point for further_antipsychotic_research

for example murasaki 1987 teaches that` the antipsychotic action [ of opc-4392 ] was not strong'
id
based on that teaching together with other_prior_art of record that focuses only on the effects of opc-4392 on schizophrenias negative_symptoms a skilled_artisan would have concluded that opc-4392 did not treat positive_symptoms
otsuka 2010_wl_4596324 at *21-22 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *68-69
the district_court also credited the testimony of one of the defendants witnesses who stated that clinical *1296 studies of opc-4392 showed that it` lacked [ an ] antipsychotic component'
id.at *21 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *68
furthermore murasaki 1987 taught that` the strength of the activating action [ of opc-4392 ] stood out' j.a
5907 a property that dr._roth testified would have been a` red flag' indicating that the drug was likely to cause patients to act out on their delusions and hallucinations
otsuka 2010_wl_4596324 at *21-22 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *69
another_prior_art reference murasaki 1988 taught that opc-4392 even at a` very low dose' id.at *12 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *41 caused` severe' side_effects j.a
10401
in light of the totality of the evidence before the district_court we perceive no clear_error in the conclusion that opc-4392 was` considered a failure insofar as it did not treat the positive_symptoms of schizophrenia and was not well-tolerated in modest doses'
otsuka 2010_wl_4596324 at *22 2010 u.s._dist
lexis 132595 at *70
the court thus did not err in concluding that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not have selected opc-4392 as a lead_compound for further_antipsychotic_research

even assuming that one would have selected opc-4392 as a lead_compound the district_court found that the defendants failed to prove that the prior_art would have directed one to make the various modifications necessary to convert opc-4392 into aripiprazole
those modifications include 1 converting opc-4392s carbostyril_core into a dihydrocarbostyril ; 2 changing opc-4392s propoxy_linker to a butoxy ; and 3 replacing opc-4392s 2-methyl and 3-methyl groups with 2-chloro and 3-chloro substituents
on appeal the defendants rely in large_part on the inventors and otsukas own development efforts in an attempt to prove that aripiprazole would have been obvious
e.g. br
defs.-appellants apotex at 46-47 arguing that otsukas aripiprazole development involved a` short timeline' and only` took a few months'
those arguments can not trump the district_courts careful fact finding however
the inventors own path itself never leads to a conclusion of obviousness ; that is hindsight
what matters is the path that the person of ordinary_skill in the art would have followed as evidenced by the pertinent prior_art
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a` patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made
`` ; life techs. inc. v. clontech labs. inc. 224_f.3d_1320 1325 fed.cir.2000` [ t ] he path that leads an inventor to the invention is expressly made irrelevant to patentability by statute`
we therefore agree with the district_court that the defendants failed to provide clear and convincing_evidence that the skilled_artisan would have known how to modify opc4392 to increase antipsychotic_activity

e. conclusion
in summary the district_courts careful analysis exposed the defendants obviousness case for what it was-a poster child for impermissible hindsight reasoning
because we agree with the district_court that the defendants failed to prove that claim 12 of the ¡¬528_patent would have been prima_facie obvious over the asserted prior_art_compounds we need not address the courts findings regarding objective_evidence of nonobviousness
in addition because the defendants arguments for obviousness of dependent_claims 17_and_23 rely on a determination of obviousness for independent claim 12 we need not separately analyze the courts finding that the defendants failed to prove invalidity for the asserted dependent_claims

ii
we now turn to the defendants contention that the district_court erred by *1297 failing to hold the asserted claims of the ¡¬528_patent invalid for nonstatutory obviousness-type_double_patenting in view of the unsubstituted_butoxy_compound of claim 13 of the ¡¬416_patent

an inventor may obtain` a patent' for an invention pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 101 ; the statute thus` permits only one patent to be obtained for a single invention'
in re lonardo 119_f.3d_960 965 fed.cir.1997
the double_patenting doctrine` precludes one person from obtaining more than one valid patent for either a thesame_invention or b anobvious modification of the same_invention'
longi 759 f.2d at 892
nonstatutory double_patenting is a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy that` prevent [ s ] the extension of the term of a patent even where an express statutory basis for the rejection is missing by prohibiting the issuance of the claims in a second patent not patentably distinct from the claims of the first patent'
id

as an initial_matter the parties disagree over the legal test for nonstatutory_double_patenting
otsuka contends that there is no difference between obviousness under ¡± 103 and obviousness-type_double_patenting
that is not entirely correct
we have noted that` a double_patenting of the obviousness type rejection is analogous to [ a failure to meet ] the non-obviousness requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103'
id.at 892_n._4_(internal_quotation_marks_omitted)
important differences remain however
the patent principally underlying the double_patenting rejection need not be prior_art
id
moreover when analyzing obviousness-type_double_patenting in cases involving claimed chemical_compounds the issue is not whether a skilled_artisan would have selected the earlier_compound as a lead_compound
that is so because the analysis must necessarily focus on the earlier claimed compound over which double_patenting has been alleged lead_compound or not
see ortho pharma corp. v. smith 959_f.2d_936 943 fed.cir.1992` [ i ] t is the claims that are compared when assessing double_patenting
``

the defendants assert that unlike an analysis under ¡± 103 the test for obviousness-type_double_patenting never asks whether the prior_art would have supplied a motivation to modify the earlier claimed compound
that is also incorrect
unless the earlier claim anticipates the later claim under ¡± 102 the question whether the two claimed compounds are` patentably distinct' implicates the question of obviousness under ¡± 103 longi 759 f.2d at 892 which in the chemical context requires identifying some reason that would have led a chemist to modify the earlier_compound to make the later compound with a reasonable_expectation of success see takeda 492 f.3d at 1357 1361

the defendants rely on geneva pharm. inc. v. glaxosmithkline plc 349_f.3d_1373 1377_n._1_(fed.cir.2003) which states in a footnote that` [ o ] bviousness requires inquiry into a motivation to modify the prior_art ; nonstatutory_double_patenting does not'
geneva however involved nonstatutory_double_patenting based on anticipation not obviousness
id
(` this genus-species relationship makes the claims patentably indistinct because the earlier species.. anticipates the later genus..'
for anticipation of course motivation in the prior_art is unimportant
see e.g. callaway golf co. v. acushnet co. 576_f.3d_1331 1347 fed.cir.2009 noting that in an` anticipation argument.. motivation to combine is not an issue'
the statement from geneva was later recited in dictum in procter & gamble_co. v. teva_pharm
usa inc. 566_f.3d_989 fed.cir.2009 in which we concluded under ¡± 103 that there would have been no motivation *1298 to modify the prior_art_compound id.at 995 and then stated` having concluded that [ the asserted compound ] was not obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 we similarly conclude that the [ asserted ] patent is not invalid for obviousness-type_double_patenting' id.at 999 emphasis added
contrary to the defendants arguments neither geneva nor procter & gamble stands for the proposition that in considering whether one compound is an obvious_variant of another for purposes of nonstatutory_double_patenting analyzing the compound of the prior claim for a reason or motivation to modify is irrelevant

we therefore reject the defendants contention that the district_court legally erred by relying in part on its findings under ¡± 103 in its subsequent double_patenting analysis
the court in this case applied the correct test for nonstatutory obviousness-type_double_patenting in the context of claimed chemical_compounds an analysis of nonstatutory obviousness-type_double_patenting-like an analysis under ¡± 103-entails determining inter alia whether one of ordinary_skill in the art would have had reason or motivation to modify the earlier claimed compound to make the compound of the asserted claim with a reasonable_expectation of success
there is no other way to consider the obviousness of compound b over compound a without considering whether one of ordinary_skill would have had reason to modify a to make b
that is traditional obviousness analysis

turning to the particulars of the district_courts decision on nonstatutory_double_patenting the defendants contend that the court improperly treated claim 13 of the ¡¬416_patent in isolation without considering prior_art such as the nakagawa_declaration which would have taught a skilled_artisan to substitute a phenyl_ring with chlorine_atoms at the 2- and 3-positions to make aripiprazole
otsuka in response argues that the court after considering the nakagawa_declaration in detail correctly concluded that aripiprazole was not an obvious_variant of the unsubstituted_butoxy

we agree with the district_court that the asserted claims are not invalid for nonstatutory_double_patenting
as we explained above aripiprazole differs structurally from the unsubstituted_butoxy of claim 13 of the ¡¬416_patent
aripiprazole has chlorine substituents at the 2_and_3 positions of its phenyl_ring whereas the unsubstituted_butoxy has hydrogens at those positions-i.e. it is` unsubstituted'
in its double_patenting analysis the court determined` that the prior_art including the nakagawa declaration.. did not teach the person of ordinary_skill in the art to pursue a 2,3-dichloro substitution on the phenyl_ring to achieve antipsychotic_activity'

and as we noted above although other_prior_art including the se_¡¬945_application disclosed 2,3-dichloro substituted compounds those references failed to tie that disclosure to any meaningful_suggestion of antipsychotic_activity

as dr. david nichols an expert in both medicinal chemistry and pharmacology testified at trial` there was no known antipsychotic_drug successful or otherwise that had those two particular [ chlorine ] substituents arranged in a 2,3.. orientation' and further` [ t ] heres no teaching that suggests that a dichlorination pattern like that would lead to a safe atypical antipsychotic or even an antipsychotic period atypical or otherwise'

in short we perceive no clear_error in the district_courts finding that one of ordinary_skill would not have been motivated to pursue a 2,3-dichloro substitution on the phenyl_ring as would have been required to convert the unsubstituted_butoxy to aripiprazole

finally the nonstatutory_double_patenting issue in this case is not as the defendants argue controlled by in re zickendraht 50_ccpa_1529 319_f.2d_225_(1963)
in zickendraht one of our predecessor courts reviewed a decision of the board of patent appeals and interferences the` board' rejecting a claimed metalliferous azodyestuff compound for nonstatutory_double_patenting over a similar compound claimed in an issued patent
the two compounds were identical but for the presence or absence of a methyl group
id.at 1534 319_f.2d_225
in affirming the boards rejection the zickendraht court noted that` [ i ] t has not been shown that this [ chemical ] difference has any effect on the dyeing characteristics of the compound'
id.at 1531 319_f.2d_225
the court also pointed out that the earlier` patent disclosure would suggest to one skilled in the art' reacting particular starting components which` should result in production of the dye claimed' in the pending application
id.at 1532 319_f.2d_225
unlike in zickendraht the evidence here not only demonstrates the unpredictability of minor structural changes on a compounds antipsychotic_properties but also indicates that the prior_art would not have provided the skilled_artisan with a reason to make the necessary_structural_changes to the unsubstituted_butoxy to yield aripiprazole

zickendraht therefore is distinguishable from the present_case

because we agree with the district_court that the prior_art would not have provided one of ordinary_skill with a reason or motivation to make aripiprazole from the unsubstituted_butoxy_compound we need not examine otsukas evidence of secondary_considerations of nonobviousness
moreover the defendants do not advance separate double_patenting arguments for the asserted dependent_claims of the ¡¬528_patent
we therefore conclude that the district_court correctly determined that all of the asserted claims of the ¡¬528_patent are not invalid for nonstatutory obviousness-type *1300 double_patenting over claim 13 of the ¡¬416_patent

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the judgment of the district_court

affirmed

defendants-appellants_apotex_inc. and apotex_corp. submitted one set of appellate briefs addressing the issues of ¡± 103 obviousness and nonstatutory_double_patenting
defendants-appellants teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc. barr_laboratories inc. and barr_pharmaceuticals inc. submitted another set of briefs that addressed only nonstatutory_double_patenting but joined in full the principal and reply briefs filed by apotex
for purposes of this opinion we will refer to the arguments in both sets of briefs as the defendants arguments
