background
the patents-in-suit are directed to roof mount_sealing_assemblies which allow users to mount objects on a roof and seal` the mounting location.. against water'
'517_patent abstract ;655_patent abstract ; see339_patent abstract
for example the517_patent claims inter_alia` [ a ] roof standoff device for use in mounting an object to a roof' comprising` a base bracket'` a flashing' 2` a core body' and` a second threaded attachment element'
'517_patent col. 10_ll._27 -29 33 43 45 claim 1
it is undisputed that sunmodos allegedly infringing products were available to the public in 2010 ; ecofastens allegedly infringing product was available to the public in june 2009,3 see d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *13 & n.16 ; and the u.s. patent and trademark office issued the patents-in-suit in 2014_and_2015
to successfully assert the patents-in-suit against the allegedly infringing products d_three was required to claim priority from the 2009 applications effective_filing_date february 5 2009
see id.at *3 *13 ; j.a
2212

on summary_judgment the district_court determined that the asserted_claims could not claim priority from the 2009 application because they were broader than the invention disclosed in the 2009 application such that they did not meet the written description_requirement pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 a 20124 see d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *5 *9-10 *12
specifically the district_court divided the asserted_claims into two categories -- claims that recited a washer and claims that did not -- and asked whether` the parent applications disclose roof_mount_assemblies that a do not have a soft_washer but also do not limit the type of attachment_bracket and b have a soft_washer but do not limit its location'
id.at *7
the district_court held that the 2009 applications only disclosure of a washerless_assembly` requir [ ed a ] w [ - ] pronged attachment_bracket 1700' but the asserted_claims disclosed broader configurations of washerless_assemblies
id.at *10 ; see j.a
*1046 2225 discussing the washerless_assembly in the 2009 application 2246 figure 41
the district_court also held that the 2009 applications assemblies with washers only disclosed washers situated` above the flashing' but the asserted_claims covered assemblies with washers below the flashing
d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *11 *12
d_three did` not dispute that without the benefit of the 2009 [ a ] pplications filing_date.. the [ p ] atents [ - ] in [ -s ] uit would be invalid due to intervening prior_art' i.e. sunmodos allegedly infringing products and ecofastens quikfoot_roof_mount_system
id.at *13
accordingly the district_court invalidated all but one of the asserted_claims as anticipated based on d_threes stipulation and found the remaining claim claim 6 of the655_patent asserted against the purportedly-withdrawn ecofastens tile_flashing_system anticipated based on other prior_art that post-dated the 2009 application

discussion
d_three argues the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment because a genuine_issue of material_fact exists as to whether the 2009 application adequately discloses the asserted_claims of the patents-in-suit
see appellants br
21-34
specifically d_three avers that the 2009 application adequately discloses 1 washerless_assemblies with` various_attachment_brackets' id.at 27 such that there is a genuine_issue as to whether a person having ordinary skill in the art` phosita' would understand the 2009 application to have disclosed different types of washerless_assemblies and 2 assemblies with washers below the flashing id.at 32-34.6 after articulating the applicable standards of review and legal standard we address each issue in turn

instead of washers the washerless *1048 claims recite for instance the use of any` attachment_bracket having a third_attachment_element disposed on an upper_portion of said attachment_bracket for attaching an object to said attachment_bracket'
'339_patent col. 11_ll._8 -10 claim 1 ; see e.g.517_patent col. 10_ll._29 -32 claim 1 ;655_patent col. 10_ll._29 -34 claim 18

the district_court determined that the 2009 application disclosed one washerless_assembly depicted in figures 27-big_token__33_and_41__big_token
d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *8
the district_court then found that` [ i ] n all of the applications' in the priority chain for the patents-in-suit including the 2009 application` the washerless_assembly consistently has one type of attachment_bracket no._1700' which is defined as` having w-shaped prongs.. and [ a ] face seat.. that can hold a support post.. in a conventional male/female interaction when needed'
id.at *9 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted
the district_court determined that a phosita would not understand bracket 1700 to be an` optional feature'
id.at *10
the parties do not dispute that the washerless_claims recitation of attachment assemblies` are not limited to assemblies using attachment_brackets with the w [ - ] shaped prongs'
id.at *9 ; see appellants br
7-8 ; appellees br
35
therefore the district_court held that because the washerless_claims` are not limited to such a bracket [ ] the [ washerless_c ] laims are not supported by the 2009 [ a ] pplication and are not entitled to the 2009 effective_filing_date'
d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *10
for the reasons set forth below we agree with the district_court

1
the attachment bracket disclosure was properly decided on summary_judgment
as an initial matter d_three argues that the district_court erred because it acknowledged that appellees` d [ id ] not specifically argue' that the 2009 application lacked sufficient detail to disclose attachment_brackets broadly appellants br
23 quoting d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *9 n.8` [ appellees ] recognize that figure 41 regards the bracket 1700 but do not specifically argue that the [ washerless_c ] laims are generic on attachment_brackets and therefore not supported'
) and` [ i ] t is not appropriate to grant summary_judgment based on facts the moving party did not rely on at least without giving the losing party advance notice and an opportunity to be heard' id
; see id
( citing fed
r._civ
p. 56 f
the grant of summary_judgment was appropriate

federal rule of civil procedure 56 f states that` [ a ] fter giving notice and a reasonable time to respond the court may.. 2 grant the motion [ for summary_judgment ] on grounds not raised by a party'
the tenth_circuit will not reverse for failure to comply with rule 56 f` absent evidence of prejudice
so long as the losing party was on notice that it had to come forward with all of its evidence a sua sponte grant of summary_judgment may be appropriate'

2005 internal_quotation_marks and *1049 citations omitted
in other words` [ a ] party is procedurally prejudiced if it is surprised by the district_courts action and that surprise results in the partys failure to present_evidence in support of its position'
kannady v. city of kiowa 590_f.3d_1161 1170 10th_cir
2010 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted
moreover the tenth_circuit distinguishes cases like this where a summary_judgment motion was filed from those where the district_court sua sponte grants summary_judgment because` when one party has made a motion for summary_judgment the failure of the court to provide notice may not be as detrimental since the moving party is at least aware that the issue has been raised'
id.at 1170 n.8 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted

here d_three` can not demonstrate prejudice because [ it ] clearly knew' the scope of the 2009 applications disclosure of washerless_assemblies` would be an issue' and it` had a full opportunity to present_evidence to support [ its ] position'
id.at 1171
appellees motion for summary_judgment provided d_three with notice that appellees were arguing lack of benefit from an earlier_filing_date particularly based on the theory that d_three claimed` different broader_inventions' j.a
2181 capitalization modified including those with` [ w ] asherless assemblies' j.a
2182 ; see j.a
2187-88 describing in the motion for summary_judgment case law rejecting validity of patents claiming broader_inventions than disclosed 2192-93 disputing the 2009 applications disclosure of washerless_assemblies
moreover a` patentee bears the burden of establishing that its claimed invention is entitled to an earlier priority_date than an asserted prior_art reference'
in re magnum oil tools int l ltd. 829_f.3d_1364 1376 fed
cir
2016
therefore d_three was` on notice that [ it ] needed to present [ its ] entire argument and all [ its ] evidence regarding' why the patents-in-suit could claim the earlier_filing_date from receipt of the motion for summary_judgment evers v. regents of univ
of colo. 509_f.3d_1304 1309 10th_cir
2007 and had ample opportunity to respond to the motion for summary_judgment in the normal course

in fact d_three did respond arguing why it believed washerless_assemblies were adequately disclosed
see j.a
3353-57
in reply appellees further explained their argument and pointed directly to the disclosure of bracket 1700
see j.a
3647-50 reply to d_threes response to the motion for summary_judgment 3778 hearing on summary_judgment
in addition appellees informed the district_court that d_three had not responded to cases showing that differences in the breadth of disclosure from an earlier patent application could not satisfy the written description_requirement see j.a
3780 an argument to which d_three responded during the hearing on the motion for summary_judgment see j.a
3780 stating by d_threes counsel in response to appellees cases on breadth of claims that` i think we cited cases that we think align with the facts and we may disagree on what those are'
d_three had its opportunity to show why a genus of attachment_brackets is described by a single attachment_bracket shown in the 2009 application and failed to make that showing
because d_three was on notice that it needed to submit evidence to show that the washerless_assemblies disclosed in the washerless_claims were adequately described in the 2009 application and had opportunities to do so see kannady 590 f.3d at 1170 we will not find a violation of rule 56 f here cf

2
the district_court properly granted summary_judgment for appellees on the washerless_claims
we now turn to the merits of the district_courts decision
`` [ d_three ] does not dispute that except for claim 8 of the655_patent and claim 4 of the339_patent the [ a ] sserted [ c ] laims do not recite a..

d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *7
see generally appellants br
d_three argues that figures 27-big_token__33_and_41__big_token of the 2009 application disclose a washerless_assembly
see appellants br
21
figure 41 shows a finished roof mount assembly embodiment from a side angle j.a
2246 and figures 27-33 provide additional detail of the bracket used in figure 41 j.a
2240-41
figure 41 does not show a washer as appellees admit see appellees br
25` no view of the figures in the 2009 application shows the configuration of the bottom of the bracket 1700 in the figure 41 embodiment where a washer and recess would be
`` and nothing in figure 41s narrative description suggests figure 41 must have a washer see j.a
2225 describing figure 41 as a` base' supporting a` bolt' that holds` bracket 1700' onto a` flashing'
therefore for purposes of summary_judgment we draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to d_three anderson 477 u.s. at 255 106_s.ct._2505 and find that the 2009 application discloses one embodiment of a washerless_assembly depicted in figures 27-big_token__33_and_41__big_token and their corresponding descriptions in the specification

having determined that the 2009 application discloses a washerless_assembly we must determine whether a phosita would recognize` upon reading the [ 2009 application ]' that any attachment_brackets as claimed in the washerless_claims could be used in washerless_assemblies
in re owens 710_f.3d_1362 1368 fed
cir
2013
we agree with the district_court that washerless_assemblies using attachments other than attachment_bracket 1700 which has` w [ - ] shaped prongs' j.a
2223 are not adequately disclosed because the 2009 application in no way contemplates the use of other_types of attachment_brackets in a washerless_assembly see j.a
2212-46 failing to disclose in the 2009 application any other washerless_assemblies
the 2009 application never uses the term washerless or describes any other_types of attachment_brackets that could be used in the claimed roof_mount_assemblies
see j.a
2212-46
d_threes admission that` [ t ] here are no statements in the 2009 application.. that suggest the various_attachment_brackets can not be used in a washerless_system' appellants br
27 emphasis added further supports our finding
as we have stated` [ i ] t is not sufficient for purposes of the written description_requirement of ¡± 112 that the disclosure when combined with the knowledge in the art would lead one to speculate as to the modifications that the inventor might have envisioned but failed to disclose'

d_three points to language in the 2009 applications specification as evidence that the 2009 application disclosed alternative attachment_brackets
see appellants br
28
specifically d_three identifies a statement that` [ phositas ] will recognize certain modifications permutations additions and sub-combinations therefore
it is therefore intended that the following appended claims hereinafter introduced are interpreted to include all such modifications permutations additions and sub-combinations are within their true sprit [ sic ] and scope'
id
( second alteration in *1051 original quoting j.a
2225
this boilerplate language at the end of the 2009 applications specification is not sufficient to show adequate disclosure of the actual combinations and attachments used in the washerless_claims

cir
2018 finding lack of adequate written description where only general soldering was disclosed in a specification but claims disclosed a specific means of soldering

d_three also incorrectly claims that this case is` analogous' to our non-precedential decision in cordis corp. v. boston scientific corp. appellants br
29 citing 188_fed.appx._984_(fed._cir._2006) ; see id.at 29-31
in cordis we found adequate written description where there was` no doubt' that prior_art disclosed two inventive_components and the question was whether the disclosure provided adequate written description for asserted claims that were` directed to one of those inventive_components and not to the other'
188 fed.appx.at 990
here by contrast the 2009 application discloses one inventive component and the washerless_claims claim entirely different inventive_components in the same field
compare j.a
2246 figure 41s washerless_assembly using a w-shaped prong with339_patent col. 11_ll._8 -9 reciting in claim 1 a washerless_assembly using an` attachment_bracket having a third_attachment_element disposed on an upper_portion of said attachment_bracket'
cordis is inapposite

testimony from d_threes expert does not convince us otherwise
d_three admits that its expert` did not specifically address why a washerless roof mount assembly that uses other attachment_brackets than figure 41 is disclosed'

cir
2012
for these reasons we agree with the district_court that all washerless_claims lack sufficient written description meaning they can not claim priority from the 2009 application
all washerless_claims except claim 6 of the339_patent and claim 6 of the655_patent are therefore invalid by stipulation see d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *13 and we affirm the district_courts holding that claim 6 of the339_patent and claim 6 of the655_patent are invalid because d_three does not separately challenge the district_courts determinations with respect to these claims see id
( discussing evidence that certain post-2009 application prior_art anticipated or made obvious all claims of the655 and339_patent s
see generally appellants br.9

c. the 2009 application_lacks_adequate written description for the assemblies with washers in the asserted_claims
at issue is the district_courts determination that the 2009 application *1052 disclosed a washer` only above the flashing' d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *11 such that it did not provide adequate written description for the inventions recited in claim 8 of the655_patent and claim 4 of the339_patent id.at *12
claim 8 of the655_patent and claim 4 of the339_patent recite an assembly with a washer
see655_patent col. 11_ll._12 -16 ;339_patent col. 11_ll._21 -26
in claim 8 of the655_patent the washer is placed` between' the bracket attached to the roof and a recess in the bottom surface of a sheet member and also` at least partially surrounds [ an ] aperture'
'655_patent col. 11_ll._13 -15
claim 4 of the339_patent depends from claim 2 which depends from claim 1 and recites the device of claim 2 with the addition of a` washer disposed around [ an ] aperture in [ a ] flashing wherein said soft_washer surrounds said aperture in said flashing and is compressed upon said first and second threaded attachment elements being threadably engaged'
'339_patent col. 11_ll._22 -26 emphasis added

d_three does not contest the district_courts finding that` [ c ] laim 8 requires the washer be [ ] located below the flashing and [ c ] laim 4 recites a washer that can be either above or below the flashing' appellants br
32 ; see d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *11-12 or that the 2009 application discloses a washer only above the flashing see appellants br
33
instead d_three contends the 2009 application provides adequate written description because it discloses` a washerless_system.. as well as a system in which a washer is shown above the flashing'
id
the disclosure of a washerless_system does not support a finding of adequate written description because it does not show that the inventor` invented what is claimed' here an assembly with a washer
ariad 598 f.3d at 1351 internal_quotation_marks and citation omitted
d_three also states that` [ n ] owhere in the specification is there a disclaimer that would require the washer to be atop the flashing as opposed to below'
appellants br
33
again adequate written description does not ask what is permissible rather it asks what is disclosed
see ariad 598 f.3d at 1351
the lack of any disclosure of an assembly with a washer below the flashing or statement on the flexibility of the position of the washer is fatal to d_threes argument
therefore we conclude that claim 8 of the655_patent and claim 4 of the339_patent lack sufficient written description in the 2009 application meaning they can not claim priority from the 2009 application and are therefore invalid
see d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *13

conclusion
we have considered the parties remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive.10 accordingly the final_judgments of the u.s._district_court for the district of colorado are

the district_court invalidated claims 1-4 6 9-14 and 16 of the517_patent ; claims 1-9 11 and 13 of the655_patent ; and claims 1-big_token__2_and_4__big_token -10 of the339_patent` the asserted_claims'
see d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *2 *13
it deemed the validity of claim 3 of the339_patent moot in light of d_three no longer asserting infringement of the claim and omitting the claim from oral argument see id.at *13 and that finding is not challenged on appeal see generally appellants br

d_three initially alleged four of ecofastens roof mounting products infringed the patents-in-suit see d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *2 listing allegations against ecofastens quikfoot_roof_mount_system eco-65 system tile_flashing_system and eco-44r-ndd system but attempted to withdraw its allegations based on all but the quikfoot_roof_mount_system during suit see id.at *13 ; see also reply br

congress amended ¡± 112 when it enacted the leahy-smith america invents act` aia' pub
l. no._112-29 ¡± 4 c 125_stat._284 296-97 2011 and aia ¡± 4 e made those changes applicable to` any patent application that is filed on or after' september 16 2012 see id.at 297
because the applications that led to the patents-in-suit were filed after september 16 2012 the post-aia version of ¡± 112 applies

d_three also asserted claim 6 of the339_patent against only the tile_flashing_system see j.a
342-46 but this claim was not addressed separately below see generally d_three 2017_wl_1023389

d_three also contests the district_courts alternative_finding that the 2009 application did not disclose a base` having at least one mounting hole'

because we affirm the district_court based on lack of adequate written description for the washerless_assemblies and position of the flashing on the assemblies with washers see infra sections ii.b.2-c we decline to reach this alternative_finding cf

for purposes of summary_judgment the district_court inferred in d_threes favor that the disclosure of a` third_attachment_element' rather than bracket in the washerless_claims of the517 and655_patent s was equivalent to an attachment_bracket d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *9 n.8 emphasis added and so will we see anderson 477 u.s. at 255 106_s.ct._2505 assuming facts in favor of non-moving party at summary_judgment ; in re mouttet 686_f.3d_1322 1330 fed

the district_court found that the validity of claim 6 of the655_patent` appear [ ed ] moot' but to the extent it was still argued was invalid
see d_three 2017_wl_1023389 at *13
because d_three does not argue the validity of the claim should be moot or make any mention of the specific claim see generally appellants br. we do not consider the claim moot and instead consider the district_courts determination of invalidity see glaxo grp ltd. v. torpharm inc. 153_f.3d_1366 1371 fed

appellees alternatively argue we may find all claims asserted against the purportedly-abandoned ecofasten products anticipated because d_three did not properly abandon its claims against those products see supra n.3 meaning d_threes infringement accusations act as a` judicial admission' of invalidity appellees br
2 11 ; see id.at 59 citing to cases holding that an` accusation that a product infringes satisfies [ the ] burden of proving that [ a ] products.. sales anticipate' if the product is considered prior_art
like the district_court we find` it is unnecessary to reach that issue'
