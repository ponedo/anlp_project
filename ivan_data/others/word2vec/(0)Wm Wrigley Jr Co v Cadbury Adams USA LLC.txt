wm
wrigley_jr._co. and cadbury_adams_usa_llc compete in the consumer market for chewing_gum
this case involves chewing_gum that provides a cooling sensation when chewed
historically chewing_gum makers have achieved that cooling sensation known as` physiological_cooling' by adding menthol to their products
menthol however has disadvantages including a strong peppermint flavor and bitterness in high concentrations
during the 1970s and 1980s wilkinson-sword ltd. attempted to develop physiological_cooling agents that would not have the drawbacks of menthol
the result was two such coolants which were released under the trade names` ws-3' and` ws-23'
wrigley and cadbury each own a patent that generally claims chewing_gum containing a combination of menthol and one of those coolants
cadbury owns u.s._patent_no._5009,893` the ¡¬893_patent` which claims a chewing_gum that combines menthol with ws-3
wrigley owns u.s. patent no._6627,233` the ¡¬233_patent` which claims a chewing_gum that combines menthol with ws-23

the application that matured into cadburys ¡¬893_patent was filed in july 1989
claim 1 one of two independent claims of the ¡¬893_patent recites 1
a chewing_gum_composition capable of providing long-lasting breath freshening perception without bitterness comprising a gum_base a sweetener and a cooling composition comprising menthol and an n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamide of [ a specific formula ]

ws-3 is an n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamide and one of the compounds described by the formula recited in claim 1
the claim therefore reads on chewing_gum that combines ws-3 and other n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides of *1359 the recited formula and menthol
the patents specification discloses that although the cooling effect of both menthol and ws-3 were known in the prior_art the combination of the two` results in an unexpected heightened cooling sensation in edible_products'
cadbury introduced into the market a variety of chewing_gum_products that embody the claims of the ¡¬893_patent
those products did well in the marketplace

after cadbury introduced its ws-3/menthol chewing_gum wrigley introduced a chewing_gum that combined menthol and ws-23
that product was the commercial embodiment of claim 34 of wrigleys ¡¬233_patent
the application for the ¡¬ 233 patent was filed in march 2000
claim 34 recites 34
a chewing_gum_composition comprising a about 5 % to about 95 % gum_base ; b about 5 % to about 95 % bulking and sweetening agent ; and
c about 0.1 [ % ] to about 10 % flavoring agent wherein the flavoring agent comprises n-2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl_butanamide and menthol
ws-23 is the trade name for n-2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl_butanamide

following the introduction of wrigleys ws-23/menthol chewing_gum cadbury reformulated some of its chewing_gum_products
cadburys reformulated chewing_gum contained both ws-23 and menthol
wrigley then filed suit against cadbury in the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois accusing cadburys reformulated chewing_gum of infringing the ¡¬233_patent
cadbury counterclaimed accusing wrigleys chewing_gum of infringing cadburys ¡¬893_patent

wrigley and cadbury each moved for summary_judgment on a number of issues
cadbury sought summary_judgment declaring claim 34 of the ¡¬233_patent invalid for obviousness and anticipation
wrigley sought summary_judgment declaring that it had not infringed the asserted claims of the ¡¬893_patent2

the district_court granted wrigleys motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement of the ¡¬893_patent
the court first noted that ws-23 is not an n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamide so a combination of ws-23 and menthol would not literally infringe the ¡¬893_patent
the court further found that the ¡¬893_patent narrowly claimed the combination of n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides and menthol and that it implicitly excluded other carboxamides including ws-23
the court therefore held that a combination of ws-23 and menthol did not infringe the ¡¬893_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

addressing cadburys summary_judgment motion the district_court concluded that claim 34 of the ¡¬233_patent was invalid on grounds of anticipation and obviousness
the court held claim 34 to be anticipated by u.s._patent_no._5688,491` shahidi' and obvious in view of u.s._patent_no._5698,181` luo' and an article written by dr. m.a
parrish` parrish'

shahidi is directed to a variety of oral compositions each of which contains xylitol and copper bis-glycinate
the compositions *1360 include chewing_gum as well as other compositions such as toothpaste mouth rinses and lozenges
shahidi lists several categories of components that can be included in the compositions
they include both` essential' and` optional' or` nonessential' components ; certain of the optional components are noted as` preferred'
a` cooling agent or combination of cooling agents' is such a` preferred nonessential' component
some of the categories further identify certain specific components as` preferred'
within the category of cooling agents shahidi discloses ws-3 and ws-23 as two of three` particularly preferred cooling agents'
shahidi also discloses menthol as one of 23 listed flavoring agents that can be used in the claimed compositions

the district_court found that shahidi discloses every limitation of claim 34
in making that determination the district_court relied on a patent incorporated by reference into shahidi which provided a range for the amount of ws-23 to include in a composition
that range is a subset of the range for the amount of flavoring agent recited in claim 34
the court further ruled that shahidi would have disclosed to one of ordinary_skill in the art how to create a cooling chewing_gum with component amounts in the ranges claimed by claim 34
the court therefore held that shahidi anticipated claim 34

luo discloses chewing_gum that achieves a cooling effect by combining ws-3 and menthol and it also discloses combining n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides with menthol
parrish which was published in 1987 describes ws-3 and ws-23 as potential replacements for menthol in a variety of applications including chewing_gum
parrish highlights that both ws-3 and ws-23 have` high cooling activity with no side-effects'
parrish does not distinguish the cooling activity of ws-3 and ws-23 although it notes that ws-3 but not ws-23 had been listed as` generally regarded as safe' by the flavor and extract manufacturers association` fema'
that approval referred to as` fema-gras_listing' was subsequently extended to ws-23

the district_court held that in light of the disclosures of luo and parrish the only novel aspect of claim 34 was the combination of menthol and ws-23
although parrish teaches substituting ws-23 for menthol rather than combining the two the court found that parrish would have made it obvious to substitute ws-23 for ws-3 in the combination of menthol and ws-3 that was disclosed in luo
the court also ruled that the evidence of secondary_considerations proffered by wrigley was not sufficient to overcome the strong showing of obviousness and establish that claim 34 was` an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior_art [ that ] was not'
stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip_corp. 713_f.2d_1530 1538 fed.cir.1983

i
on appeal wrigley argues that shahidi does not anticipate claim 34 for two reasons
first wrigley argues that while shahidi discloses all the claim limitations found in claim 34 it does not disclose them in the combination recited in that claim.3 second and relatedly wrigley argues *1361 that shahidi would not have enabled a person of ordinary_skill in the art to derive the combination recited in claim 34 without undue_experimentation

for a prior_art_reference to anticipate a claim it must disclose all of the limitations of the claim` arranged or combined in the same_way as in the claim'
net_moneyin inc. v. verisign inc. 545_f.3d_1359 1370 fed.cir.2008
for example in net_moneyin this court held that an` internet payment system' was not anticipated by a prior_art_reference that disclosed all the components of the invention because the reference disclosed two separate payment protocols each of which contained only a subset of the components claimed in the patent at issue
id.at 1371
therefore the reference did not` prove prior invention of the thing claimed'
id

in this case by contrast shahidi envisions using ws-23 and menthol in a single product
while shahidi discloses a number of different combinations of cooling and flavoring elements one of them is the combination of menthol which shahidi identifies as one of the` most suitable' flavoring agents with ws-23 which shahidi identifies along with ws-3 as among a group of three` particularly preferred cooling agents'
based on the disclosure of the combination of those components we agree with the district_court that shahidi anticipates claim 34

this is not a case in which the prior_art_reference merely discloses a genus and the claim at issue recites a species of that genus
in such a case the issue of anticipation turns on whether the genus was of such a defined and limited class that one of ordinary_skill in the art could` at once envisage' each member of the genus
eli_lilly & co. v. zenith goldline pharm. inc. 471_f.3d_1369 1376 fed.cir.2006
shahidi specifically discloses ws-23 as a coolant and menthol as a flavoring agent
the question for purposes of anticipation is therefore whether the number of categories and components in shahidi was so large that the combination of ws-23 and menthol would not be immediately apparent to one of ordinary_skill in the art
see perricone v. medicis pharm corp. 432_f.3d_1368 1377 fed.cir.2005 distinguishing cases in which a prior_art_reference discloses a genus from those in which it discloses a number of species as part of a list

wrigley argues that impax laboratories inc. v. aventis pharmaceuticals inc. 545_f.3d_1312_(fed.cir.2008) stands for the proposition that a prior_art_reference is not anticipatory if one of ordinary_skill in the art would be required to pick items from two lists of components in order to assemble the invention
the issue in impax was whether the use of the drug riluzole for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis` als' was anticipated by *1362 u.s._patent_no._5236,940` the ¡¬940_patent`
id.at 1314
the ¡¬940_patent disclosed a formula that encompassed` hundreds or thousands of compounds'
id.at 1315
the ¡¬940_patent also listed a number of diseases including als that could potentially be treated with compounds of the disclosed formula
id
while we affirmed the district_courts finding that undue_experimentation would have been required to practice the patent at issue in impax there are important distinctions between that case and this one
unlike the prior_art_reference at issue in impax where there was no disclosed dosage information for using riluzole to treat als see id. shahidi discloses component amounts within the ranges claimed in claim 34
even more importantly shahidi specifically discloses the use of both ws-23 and menthol in chewing_gum whereas the only mention of riluzole in the prior_art_reference in impax was to disclaim it from the disclosed invention
see id
(` the ¡¬940_patent.. specifically excludes riluzole from the invention'

given the objective of the ¡¬233_patent to obtain` a cooling flavor composition that will contribute a long-lasting cooling sensation' and a chewing_gum with a` clean high-quality flavor.. with a good cooling effect' the shahidi reference clearly identifies the combination of ws-23 which shahidi identifies as one of three` particularly preferred' cooling agents and menthol which shahidi identifies as being among the` most suitable' flavoring ingredients.4 the district_court therefore correctly held that shahidi anticipates claim 34 of the ¡¬233_patent

ii
wrigley also argues that the district_court erred in finding that the combination recited in the ¡¬233_patent would have been obvious in light of luo and parrish
in particular wrigley argues that the combination of ws-23 and menthol resulted in unexpected_cooling beyond what would have been predicted by one of ordinary_skill in the art

evidence that a combination of known components results in an effect greater than the predicted additive effect of the components can support a finding of nonobviousness
see crocs inc. v. int l_trade_comm n 598_f.3d_1294 1309 fed.cir.2010` even if the [ patent at issue ] were a combination of known elements according to their established functions.. it yields more than predictable results [ and therefore is ] non-obvious
`` ; merck & co. v. biocraft labs. inc. 874_f.2d_804 808 fed.cir.1989
in this case however the synergistic effect of combining coolants had already been discovered as reflected in the prior_art
luo disclosed a` synergy' between menthol and ws-3 when menthol was included in high amounts and disclosed that the combination produced an` enhanced breath-freshening effect' in which each component played` a vital role'
parrish identified ws-3 and ws-23 as especially favored cooling agents for commercial_use from among 1200 tested compounds that induced a cooling effect
moreover parrish pointed to four characteristics shared by the ws-3 and ws-23 molecules that were associated with their physiological_cooling effect suggesting *1363 that the two compounds would likely have similar effects when ingested
therefore to show that the cooling effect of the combination of ws-23 and menthol was unexpected wrigley needed to demonstrate that the results were unexpected to a significant_degree beyond what was already known about the effect of combining ws-3 and menthol
see ex parte nutrasweet co. 19_u.s.p.q.2d_1586 1589 b.p.a.i.1991` it would at least be necessary to demonstrate that the improvements observed were greater to an unobvious extent than those which would have been expected from the reference teachings and that those differences were of some significant practical advantage
``

as evidence that the claimed combination produced unexpected_results and drove the commercial_success of wrigleys chewing_gums wrigley points to an internal cadbury study comparing wrigley and cadbury_products
that study concluded that the flavor and cooling features of wrigleys products were superior to those of the cadbury_products with which they were compared
the study noted however that besides having a` newer more advanced cooling system' the tested wrigley_products differed from the comparable cadbury_products in a number of other ways including having sweetener levels three times higher than cadburys products ; more encapsulated sweeteners for longer sweetness duration ; higher gum_base and filler levels that allowed for a more efficient flavor release ; and significantly more expensive ingredients
moreover the` cooling system' used in wrigleys products was not simply a combination of menthol and ws-23 as recited in claim 34 of the ¡¬233_patent
instead as the district_court noted it was a formulation that` contained menthol and ws-23 along with several other ingredients' and the menthol and ws-23 components were present in quantities not specifically identified in claim 34
therefore cadburys study does not demonstrate that the broadly claimed combination recited in claim 34 results in unexpected_cooling beyond the degree that was already predictable based on the prior_art

the same analysis applies to wrigleys argument that the commercial_success of its chewing_gum containing menthol and ws-23 shows that the claimed invention was nonobvious
as the district_court noted for commercial_success to be probative evidence of nonobviousness a nexus must be shown between the claimed invention and the evidence of commercial_success
in this case the district_court concluded wrigley failed to establish such a nexus
rather the court observed in the documents on which wrigley relies` many factors were identified as contributing to [ wrigleys commercial ] success including marketing efforts the way in which the gum was packaged the amounts of gum_base and sweeteners used and the cooling system used'
in sum the district_court found` no evidence of any nexus between the success of wrigleys chewing_gums covered by claim 34 and the specific_combination of menthol and ws-23' and therefore held that` the fact that wrigleys gums are successful does not alter the obviousness_analysis'

for the reasons given by the district_court we agree that wrigley has not established a sufficient nexus between the invention of claim 34 of the ¡¬233_patent and the success in the marketplace of its chewing_gum_products that contain a combination of menthol and ws-23
cadburys internal study of wrigleys product showed that it differed from cadburys comparable product in several ways that could have *1364 contributed to the commercial_success of wrigleys gum
because the evidence does not show that the success of wrigleys product was directly attributable to combining ws-23 rather than ws-3 with menthol the district_court properly discounted the evidence of commercial_success as a secondary consideration rebutting cadburys showing that the claimed invention would have been obvious

wrigley also argues that evidence that cadbury copied the combination of ws-23 and menthol shows that the combination would not have been obvious
in some cases evidence that a competitor has copied a product embodying a patented invention can be an indication of nonobviousness
see iron grip barbell co. v. usa sports inc. 392_f.3d_1317 1325 fed.cir.2004
however as the district_court observed` [ j ] ust as with the commercial_success analysis a nexus between the copying and the novel aspects of the claimed invention must exist for evidence of copying to be given significant weight in an obviousness_analysis'
the district_court acknowledged that wrigley had shown through internal_documents that cadbury had sought to copy wrigleys invention by adding ws-23 to the cooling agents of some of its products
but the court added that wrigley had not shown evidence suggesting that` the novel combination of ws-23 and menthol is what led cadbury to copy wrigleys chewing_gums' and in the absence of that evidence the court found that wrigley had failed to establish the requisite nexus between` cadburys copying and the merits of the claimed invention'

besides the absence of evidence of a nexus between cadburys copying and wrigleys claimed invention there is evidence suggesting the contrary
in particular the evidence shows that in the market for chewing_gum the parties have a practice of marketing very similar products
while cadburys internal_documents show that it sought to reformulate its products to match wrigleys products that desire extended not just to the inclusion of ws-23 but to the inclusion of similar sweeteners and similar levels of each
wrigleys evidence of copying is therefore not a strong indicator of nonobviousness but rather a measure of the extent to which parties in the chewing_gum market typically copy any development by their competitors whether patented or not

this case presents a strong case of obviousness based on the prior_art_references of record
claim 34 recites a combination of elements that were all known in the prior_art and all that was required to obtain that combination was to substitute one well-known cooling agent for another
luo taught the physiological_cooling effect from combining menthol with ws-3
parrish showed that ws-3 and ws-23 were the two most attractive cooling agents for commercial_use from among 1200 cooling agents tested
shahidi taught the combination of menthol and cooling agents of which ws-3 and ws-23 were two of the three most preferred candidates
and a prior_art 1995 patent owned by the procter & gamble company u.s._patent_no._5451,404 specifically refers to the combination of menthol and ws-23 along with other components in a composition designed to produce physiological_cooling
under these circumstances it is fair to say that there were` a finite number of identified predictable solutions' to the problem of finding physiological_cooling agents for chewing_gum and that the combination of menthol and ws-23 was` the product not of innovation but of ordinary *1365 skill and common sense'
ksr int l co. v. teleflex_inc. 550_u.s._398 421 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
this case is thus one in which a person of ordinary_skill in the art would find it` obvious to try' the combination recited in claim 34
id
we therefore uphold the district_courts conclusion that even in light of the evidence of secondary_considerations claim 34 would have been obvious in light of luo and parrish.5

iii
in its cross-appeal cadbury argues that the district_court made two errors regarding the ¡¬893_patent both of which involve whether chewing_gum formulations that combine menthol with ws-23 are within the patents scope
first cadbury argues that in its claim_construction ruling the district_court improperly found that the ¡¬893_patent disclaimed certain compounds including ws-23
second cadbury argues that the court erred in ruling that the doctrine of equivalents could not be used to extend the reach of the ¡¬893_patent to cover a chewing_gum containing a combination of menthol and ws-23

in its opening claim_construction brief cadbury argued that the term` n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamide' should be construed according to its ordinary meaning
wrigley responded that the ¡¬893_patent should be read to exclude all compounds other than n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides
that would exclude ws-23 which is not an n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamide
in its reply brief on claim_construction cadbury argued that the patent did not disclaim compounds other than` ws-3 and its related carboxamides' and in particular that the patent did not disclaim ws-23
the district_court agreed with wrigley that the ¡¬893_patent disclaimed all compounds other than n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides and construed the term` n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamide' to mean` a class of molecules with the chemical formulas set forth in claims 1_and_12 of the ¡¬893_patent'

on appeal all parties now agree that the claimed n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides do not include ws-23
wrigleys products are therefore plainly not within the literal scope of the claims of the ¡¬893_patent
while cadbury argues that wrigleys products infringe under the doctrine of equivalents we agree with the district_court that ws-23 is not an equivalent of ws-3 for purposes of the ¡¬893_patent

as the district_court noted the disclosure of the ¡¬893_patent focuses narrowly on n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides and not on carboxamides generally
the` summary of the invention' section states that` [ a ] pplicants have unexpectedly found that n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides *1366 when used in combination with menthol in specific amounts results in an unexpected heightened cooling sensation in edible_products'
the specification adds that certain species of n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides-and not carboxamides generally-' are quite similar structurally to menthol itself'
while there is some dispute as to the mechanism by which ws-3 and ws-23 provide cooling sensation it is clear that ws-23 is not structurally similar to menthol in the same_way that n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides are
finally the claims themselves are narrow not even claiming all n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides but only a subset of those compounds
see tanabe seiyaku co. v. int l_trade_comm n 109_f.3d_726 732 fed.cir.1997 narrow language in the claims and specification can preclude use of doctrine of equivalents to reach beyond what is literally claimed ; see also bicon inc. v. straumann co. 441_f.3d_945 955 fed.cir.2006` a claim that contains a detailed recitation of structure is properly accorded correspondingly limited recourse to the doctrine of equivalents
``

cadburys argument that abraxis bioscience inc. v. mayne pharma inc. 467_f.3d_1370_(fed.cir.2006) compels a different result is unavailing
the issue in abraxis was whether diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid` dtpa' could be considered as an equivalent of edetate
both compounds belonged to` a broad class of structurally analogous compounds known as polyaminocarboxylic acids'
id.at 1379_n._7
the patentee however had narrowly claimed edetate
id.at 1381
we rejected the argument that such narrow claiming precluded the patentee from arguing that dpta was an equivalent of edetate
id.at 1380
in so finding we relied on the fact that it was unknown at the time of the invention that the properties of dtpa made it a suitable substitute for edetate in the claimed invention
id.at 1381-82
because it was unknown that dtpa and edetate were interchangeable the patentee had no reason to claim dtpa and we therefore held that dtpa could be considered to be within the scope of the patent under the doctrine of equivalents
id
; see also kinzenbaw v. deere & co. 741_f.2d_383 389 fed.cir.1984` the doctrine of equivalents is designed to protect inventors from unscrupulous copyists and unanticipated equivalents
``

the facts of this case support the opposite inference
the inventors of the ¡¬ 893 patent were introduced to ws-3 and ws-23 by a salesman for sterling organics the distributor of the compounds during the same sales call and they were told that the two compounds were appropriate for the same uses
although the fact that ws-23 did not enjoy fema-gras_listing at the time of the invention might have prevented cadbury from marketing a chewing_gum containing a combination of ws-23 and menthol it would not have precluded the inventors from anticipating that ws-23 could be used as a substitute for ws-3
thus the inventors were on notice of the potential interchangeability of ws-23 and ws-3 yet they drafted the claims of the ¡¬893_patent narrowly to recite certain n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides not a broader category of carboxamides that would include ws-23
the trial court therefore properly held that cadbury could not expand the coverage of its patent to include ws-23 through the doctrine of equivalents

each party shall bear its own costs for this appeal

affirmed

newman circuit_judge concurring in part dissenting in part
i concur in part iii of the courts opinion and agree that wrigley does not infringe *1367 cadburys ¡¬893_patent
however i must dissent from parts i and ii
i would sustain the validity of wrigleys ¡¬233_patent for the district_court departed from the routine correct law of obviousness and anticipation
on the correct law the district_courts decisions on these grounds are not supportable

i. obviousness
to be patentable the subject_matter must be unobvious in view of what has gone before
this determination is made by examiners in the patent and trademark office ; and when that agencys grant of a patent is challenged in litigation the court applies the analytical protocol set forth in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) and reconfirmed by the court in ksr international co. v. teleflex_inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)
in litigation the burden of proof is on the challenger by clear and convincing evidence for the patent as granted by the agency is presumed valid

in graham the court set forth four factual areas on which the determination of obviousness is based 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention and 4 any objective_factors such as commercial_success long-felt but unsolved need and copying by others
383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684
the district_court erred in its treatment of the fourth factor for as explained in simmons fastener corp. v. illinois tool works inc. 739_f.2d_1573_(fed.cir.1984) the section 103 test of nonobviousness set forth in graham is a four part inquiry comprising not only the three familiar elements scope and content of the prior_art differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue and level of ordinary_skill in the pertinent art but also evidence of secondary_considerations when such_evidence is of course present
id.at 1575

the district_court and my colleagues on this panel err by holding that cadbury established a prima_facie_case of obviousness on prior_art alone viz. the luo and parrish_references
it is agreed that these references do not show the wrigley_composition
when the evidence of commercial_success and copying by the infringer is considered a prima_facie_case of obviousness is not demonstrated
in stratoflex inc. v. aeroquip_corp. 713_f.2d_1530 fed.cir.1983 the court explained that` evidence of secondary_considerations may often be the most probative and cogent evidence in the record
it may often establish that an invention appearing to have been obvious in light of the prior_art was not
it is to be considered as part of all the evidence not just when the decisionmaker remains in doubt after reviewing the art'

the district_court holding that a prima_facie_case of obviousness was established on the prior_art alone shifted the burden of proof to the patentee to rebut the asserted but improper prima_facie_case with the evidence of commercial_success and copying
this is a distortion of the burden of proof which never leaves the challenger see in re cyclobenzaprine_hydrochloride_extended-release_capsule_patent_litig. 676_f.3d_1063 1078 fed.cir.2012` [ t ] he supreme court has never imposed nor even contemplated a formal_burden-shifting framework in the patent litigation context`
it is also a distortion of reasoned *1368 analysis for as the court stated in graham` [ s ] uch secondary_considerations as commercial_success long felt but unsolved needs failure of others etc. might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject_matter sought to be patented'
383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684
all of the circumstances must be considered

the panel majority affirms the district_courts misplaced analysis agreeing that the luo and parrish_references present a prima_facie_case of obviousness and that the burden of rebuttal_shifts to the patentee
maj. op.at 1363` therefore to show that the cooling effect of the combination of ws-23 and menthol was unexpected wrigley needed to demonstrate that the results were unexpected to a significant_degree beyond what was already known about the effect of combining ws-3 and menthol`
the cited references indeed show relevant information
the luo reference shows ws-3 in combination with menthol and mentions the generic class of n-substituted-p-menthane_carboxamides but does not mention ws-23
the parrish reference mentions both ws-3 and ws-23 as replacements for menthol but does not show the combination of either ws-3 or ws-23 with menthol
wrigley provided a large amount of evidence much of it from cadburys records of the unexpected_results and commercial_success of the combination of ws-23 with menthol

the evidence established that 1 although ws-3 alone is two to three times more effective as a coolant in chewing_gum than ws-23 alone when combined with menthol ws-23 is not only more effective but is sufficiently more effective such that there is a vast preference among gum-chewers ; and 2 cadbury observed its major loss of sales to the new wrigley gum analyzed the wrigley_product concluded that the ws-23_menthol_combination was responsible for the consumer_preference and then copied the wrigley_product
this information surely colors the understanding of the prior_art as seen by a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the invention for the improved properties that produced the striking consumer_preference for wrigleys new composition are nowhere signaled in the cited references
these objective_considerations are not consigned to rebuttal for they are direct evidence of obviousness

the district_court erred in holding the ¡¬233 composition prima facie obvious on only part of the evidence ignoring the evidence that supports unobviousness
as remarked by judge learned hand` courts made up of laymen as they must be are likely either to underrate or to overrate the difficulties in making new and profitable discoveries in fields with which they can not be familiar ; and so far as it is available they had best appraise the originality involved by the circumstances which preceded attended and succeeded the appearance of the invention'
safety car heating & lighting co. v. general elec co. 155_f.2d_937 939 2d cir.1946

the advantageous properties of the wrigley combination of ws-23 and menthol are not predicted or suggested or even hinted in any reference
my colleagues on this panel hold that` wrigley needed to demonstrate that the results were unexpected to a significant_degree beyond what was already known about the cooling effects of ws-3 and menthol'
maj. op.at 1363
this criterion although unwarranted was surely met
cadburys own test report states that although ws-3 alone exhibits a cooling intensity three *1369 times that of ws-23 when combined with menthol` ws-23 cooling technology was positively correlated with increased overall liking and also with flavor and cooling intensity at 5 minutes and ten minutes'
j.a
3320
this observation has no foreshadow in the prior_art
it is highly relevant and on the facts of this case precludes summary_judgment of obviousness

nonetheless the district_court states and my colleagues agree that there was` no evidence of any nexus between the success of wrigleys chewing_gums covered by claim 34 and the specific_combination of menthol and ws-23'
maj. op.at 1363
the record is rife with such_evidence
cadburys own records specifically identify the combination of ws-23 and menthol as` key_drivers for liking'
j.a
3310 ; j.a
2996-3000
as further evidence of a clear and undisputed nexus wrigley points to marketing material that stresses the cooling effect of its ws-23 reformulated chewing_gums describing the gums as` even more powerful' producing` icy cool breath that lasts' and generating a` just brushed clean feeling ;' and that` its cooler longer lasting and more icy !'
j.a
3012 ; j.a

similarly after cadbury copied wrigleys formulation using ws-23 cadbury advertised its new products` new taste
new chill' and` now
cooler
longer'
advertising the benefits of the claimed invention links the invention to commercial_success
cf
gambro lundia ab v. baxter healthcare corp. 110_f.3d_1573 1579 fed.cir.1997` the prominence of the patented technology in.. advertising creates an inference that links the.. invention to this success`
no contrary evidence was offered to the strong evidence of a nexus between the invention and its market success
`` to the extent that the patentee demonstrates the required nexus his objective_evidence of nonobviousness will be accorded more or less weight'
in re gpac inc. 57_f.3d_1573 1580 fed.cir.1995
`` once the patentee demonstrates a prima facie nexus the burden of coming forward with evidence in rebuttal_shifts to the challenger'
id
no such rebuttal evidence was presented

my colleagues finding that nexus was not established maj. op.at 1363-64 is hard to fathom
cadburys own documents showed that cadbury changed its formulation to copy wrigleys new gums containing ws-23 and menthol
a cadbury internal report states that cadbury expected that if it did not reformulate its gums it would lose market share at a cost in the united states of` $ 2mm in year 1 then $ 3.5mm $ 5.0mm and $ 7.0mm in subsequent years and projects that maximum lost sales would amount to half of the brand growth projected on dentyne ice to be at risk approx
$ 25mm per year'
j.a
2984
the cadbury report states that wrigleys gums use a` newer more advanced cooling system than ws-3' and that` cooling' and` breath freshening' are` key_drivers of [ consumer ] loyalty'
j.a
2985

contrary to my colleagues hypothesis the fact that cadbury also copied wrigleys sweeteners does not negate the undisputed record that cadbury copied the composition of ws-23 with menthol in order to obtain the improved cooling of this composition an effect that both competitors advertised for these products
cadburys internal_documents state that cadbury copied the wrigley cooling system because it was` more advanced' and` preferred' by consumers over cadburys product which used ws-3 with menthol

*1370 it is not disputed that the superior properties of the ws-23_menthol_combination were not shown or suggested in the prior_art
the district_court erred in its application of the graham_factors by asking whether the evidence of secondary_considerations were sufficient to overcome its` final_conclusion' that the patent is obvious
d.ct
op.at 42 citing leapfrog enterprises inc. v. fisher-price inc. 485_f.3d_1157_(fed.cir.2007) for the proposition that` the evidence on secondary_considerations was inadequate to overcome a final_conclusion' of obviousness
`` evidence of secondary_considerations including evidence of unexpected_results and commercial_success are but a part of thetotality of the evidence that is used to reach the ultimate conclusion of obviousness'
richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476 1483 fed.cir.1997 ; see also cyclobenzaprine 676 f.3d at 1079-80` [ o ] pinions of this court should not be read to require a burden-shifting framework in derogation of stratoflexs directive that objective_evidence be considered before making an obviousness determination and in disregard of where the burdens of proof and persuasion are properly placed in district_court litigation
``

a court may not presuppose that regardless of the evidence of commercial_success and unexpected_results the invention is obvious based on prior_art alone
the secondary indicia of nonobviousness must be considered in deciding whether a prima_facie_case of obviousness has been presented
see stratoflex 713 f.2d at 1538` it is jurisprudentially inappropriate to disregard any relevant_evidence on any issue in any case patent cases included
thus evidence rising out of the so-calledsecondary_considerations must always when present be considered en route to a determination of obviousness
`` ; ashland oil inc. v. delta resins & refractories inc. 776_f.2d_281 306 fed.cir.1985` just as it is legal_error for a district_court to fail to consider relevant_evidence going to secondary_considerations it may be legal_error for a district_court to presuppose that all evidence relating to secondary_considerations when considered with the other graham indicia relating to the obviousness/nonobviousness issue can not be of sufficient probative value to elevate the subject_matter of the claimed invention to the level of patentable invention'
( internal_citation omitted ; pentec inc. v. graphic controls corp. 776_f.2d_309_(fed.cir.1985)` objective evidence of nonobviousness when present must always be considered before reaching a legal conclusion under ¡± 103' ; kan. jack inc. v. kuhn 719_f.2d_1144 1150-51 fed.cir.1983 finding that a district_courts consideration of commercial_success complied with` the basic requirement that all evidence touching the obvious-nonobvious issue be fully considered before a conclusion is reached on that issue' ; richardson-vicks 122 f.3d at 1483` we must consider all of the evidence under the graham_factors before reaching our decision' ; in re mageli et al. 470_f.2d_1380 1384 ccpa 1973 evidence bearing on issue of nonobviousness` is never ofno moment is always to be considered and accorded whatever weight it may have`
to the extent this court has made statements to the contrary e.g. wyers v. master lock co. 616_f.3d_1231 1246 fed.cir.2010` secondary_considerations of nonobviousness-considered here by the district_court-simply can not overcome a strong prima_facie_case of obviousness' earlier precedent controls
see newell cos. inc. v. kenney mfg co. 864_f.2d_757 765 fed.cir.1988` [ p ] rior decisions of a panel of the court are binding precedent on subsequent *1371 panels unless and until overturned in banc'

the district_court erred in granting summary_judgment of obviousness for the criteria for summary_judgment of invalidity on this ground were clearly not met
i respectfully dissent from the courts contrary ruling

ii
anticipation
the district_court also granted summary_judgment of invalidity on the ground of anticipation not relying on any reference cited for obviousness but relying on a different reference that does not show the claimed combination at all but merely presents the ingredients on lists

the term` anticipation' in patent law means that the invention was previously known
if the invention was known it is anticipated
the district_court found` anticipation' by a reference that presents lists of hundreds of possible_ingredients of chewing_gum from which the district_court and now this court select wrigleys components ws-23 and menthol
the purported anticipatory reference does not show this combination and does not present so short and selective a list of these ingredients as to warrant an inference that their combination was already known
the shahidi patent u.s._patent_no._5688,491 the ¡¬491_patent on which the district_court and my colleagues rely contains lists of many known ingredients that might be used in an assortment of products including chewing_gums dentifrices and mouthwashes
shahidis lists include humectants surfactants thickeners abrasives stannous salts copper salts flavoring agents sweeteners and cooling agents which can be combined in over a million possible_combinations see wrigley br
18
shahidi names three known preferred cooling agents ws-3 ws-23 and tk-10 as well as a large_number of other cooling agents in five identified u.s
patents
¡¬491_patent col.4 ll.14-32

shahidi also states that flavoring agents` well known in the art' can be used naming anise cassia clove dihydroanethole estragole eucalyptol menthol methyl salicylate peppermint axanone phenyl ethyl alcohol sweet birch eugenol spearmint cinnamic aldehyde menthone alpha-ionone ethyl vanillin limonene isoamylacetate benzaldehyde thymol ethylbutryate and` many others'
id.at col.7 ll.16-22
shahidi does not describe any specific_composition containing either ws-23 or menthol nor the combination of ws-23 and menthol for any purpose
nonetheless my colleagues affirm the district_courts grant of summary_judgment and hold that shahidi` anticipates' the wrigley_composition of ws-23 and menthol
that is an incorrect understanding of the law of` anticipation'

the district_court apparently went astray in applying this courts ruling in perricone v. medicis pharmaceutical corp. 432_f.3d_1368 fed.cir.2005 for the district_court states that it suffices to anticipate if the ingredients ws-23 and menthol can be found somewhere on shahidis lists although shahidi shows only long lists of possible_ingredients for shahidis unrelated compositions
perricone does not hold that a specific unknown composition is deemed known if its components can be found separately on lists of possible components
see id.at 1375-76
it is the scope specificity and content of the list that controls whether the disclosure is so specific as to be deemed a disclosure of specific_combinations

this court has explained that in order to anticipate the prior_art must be such *1372 that a person of ordinary_skill would` at once envisage' the specific claimed composition
impax_labs. inc. v. aventis pharms inc. 468_f.3d_1366 1383 fed.cir.2006 ; in re petering 49_ccpa_993 301_f.2d_676 681 1962
when the listing of many possible_ingredients does not produce immediate recognition of the specific_combination the list does not` anticipate' that combination
my colleagues misconstrue perricone for that case does not rely on the distinction between a list and a genus in determining whether the claimed invention is` new' and does not hold that every list of whatever form and length and complexity anticipates every combination of the listed components
in perricone the list contained fourteen ingredients including ascorbyl palmitate for use in cosmetic_cream and the court held that this anticipated claims to ascorbyl palmitate for use in cosmetic_cream
perricone did not hold that all lists are anticipating as a matter of law
rather perricone alerts the trier of fact to the factual nature of` anticipation' and the specific circumstances whereby a specific product on a list may be found to be identified for the patentees specific_composition

the district_court erred in viewing perricone as holding that` the mere fact that the elements of a claim are set forth in the prior_art patent in a list along with the other ingredients without anyspecial emphasis is irrelevant to an anticipation analysis
instead all that is relevant is whether the prior_art disclosure is enabling'
d.ct
op.at 27 internal_citation omitted
to the contrary the way the elements are set forth in the reference and its lists is highly relevant for an anticipating reference must show the specific ingredients and direct their selection such that the specific_combination is deemed to have existed
see impax_labs. 468 f.3d at 1383 the specific_combination must be at once envisaged

it was not disputed that a person of ordinary_skill would not at once envisage wrigleys combination of ws-23 and menthol from shahidis lists
see eli_lilly & co. v. zenith goldline pharms. inc. 471_f.3d_1369 1375 fed.cir.2006` to anticipate a prior_art_reference must place the inventive compound or composition in the possession of the public'
from the large_number of listed ingredients and possible_combinations of ingredients and the absence of any selection of the combination of ws-23 and menthol in chewing_gum shahidi does not anticipate the combination of ws-23 and menthol in chewing_gum
from the courts erroneous ruling of law and its incorrect application i respectfully dissent

this appeal concerns wrigleys` production' gum
cadbury moved for summary_judgment that certain experimental chewing_gum produced by wrigley infringed the ¡¬893_patent
the district_court denied that motion and cadbury has not pursued that issue on appeal
3
cadbury contends that in the district_court wrigley failed to make that argument as well as its argument that unexpected_results show the ¡¬233_patent was not obvious
for that reason cadbury contends wrigley has waived those arguments
we conclude that wrigley presented the essence of its present arguments to the district_court sufficiently to preserve those arguments for appeal
see warner-lambert co. v. teva pharm
usa inc. 418_f.3d_1326 1338 n. ll fed.cir.2005
in the district_court wrigley argued that because shahidi disclosed` a large_number of optional or non-essential categories of ingredients' it did not disclose` the combination ofmenthol and ws-23 in a chewing_gum_composition'
although in much abbreviated form that is essentially the same argument wrigley makes as to anticipation on appeal
as for obviousness wrigleys argument as to unexpected_results was also skimpy but it asserted that` the performance of ws-23 in combination with menthol in chewing_gum applications would not have been predicted by one of ordinary_skill in the art' which was enough to preserve the` unexpected_results' argument for appeal
4
while the dissent notes that shahidi listed a number of flavoring agents a person of ordinary_skill in the art would recognize menthol as extremely well known in the prior_art for inclusion in a cooling gum
the fact that one of ordinary_skill in the art might also have included other flavorings would not remove the resulting composition from the broad reach of claim 34
5
we do not adopt a` formal_burden-shifting framework' see in re cyclobenzaprine_hydrochloride_extended-release_capsule_patent_litig. 676_f.3d_1063 1077 fed.cir.2012 nor did the district_court
as noted in cyclobenzaprine use of the terms` prima facie' and` rebuttal' in addressing an invalidity challenge does not constitute reversible error as long as the court` consider [ s ] all evidence of obviousness and nonobviousness before reaching a determination' and does not shift the burden from the patent challenger
id
in this case the district_court addressed the objective_considerations put forth by wrigley prior to making a determination of obviousness
the district_court in cyclobenzaprine by contrast concluded that` the invention was obvious' before considering the objective_factors
