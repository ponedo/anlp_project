gajarsa circuit_judge
this is a patent_infringement_case relating to chimeric_genes
plaintiff-appellee monsanto_co.` monsanto' brought a declaratory_judgment_action against defendant-appellant bayer bioscience n.v.` bayer' challenging the validity and unenforceability of four bayer_patents u.s. patent nos._5545,565` the ¡¬565_patent` 5,767,372` the ¡¬372_patent` 6,107,546` the ¡¬546_patent` and 5,254,799` the ¡¬799_patent` and asserting that monsantos transgenic corn products did not infringe these patents
bayer appeals a final_judgment issued after jury_trial declaring the asserted claims of the ¡¬565_patent invalid and non-infringed
in addition bayer appeals the final_judgment of the district_court that the four patents are unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
we affirm the district_courts conclusion that the ¡¬565_patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct and hold that the district_court had jurisdiction to declare the ¡¬372 ¡¬546 and ¡¬ 799 patents unenforceable
accordingly we do not reach the other_issues raised by bayer on appeal

i
strains of the bacteria bacillus thuringiensis` bt' produce proteins known as bt_toxins that while harmless for humans and most animals are toxic to certain_crop-destroying insects
in the 1980s multiple companies and academic groups took advantage of the newly emergent science of genetic engineering by attempting to insert a gene for bt_toxin into plants through a process known as transformation
the goal was for these genetically engineered plants to express i.e. produce a bt_toxin_protein in sufficient quantities to make the plants insect-resistant.1 difficulties *1232 in getting plants to express a full-length bt_toxin_gene which encodes a protein of approximately 130 kd,2 led researchers to investigate various alternatives
in 1986 plant genetic systems n.v. a predecessor of bayer hereinafter referred to as` bayer' succeeded in obtaining plants that expressed a truncated form of a bt_toxin
this shortened protein was produced by transforming the plants with a fragment of a bt_toxin_gene that encoded the first part or n-terminal end of the toxin using the bacterium agrobacterium tumefaciens` agrobacterium` a known system for plant transformation.3

the four patents involved in the present suit relate to this invention
the ¡¬ 565 patent claims chimeric_genes4 comprising a a truncated_bt_toxin_gene encoding an approximately 60 kd to 80 kd bt_toxin of a specific amino acid sequence,5 and b the regulatory_region of a gene` naturally expressed in plant_cells' 6 which enables the gene to be transcribed in plants i.e. a` plant_promoter' where the bt_toxin_gene is under the control of the plant_promoter.7 the ¡¬372_patent ¡¬546_patent and the ¡¬799_patent are directed towards various other aspects of the technology including plant_cells and plants that produce the insecticidal protein and methods of transforming plants with the chimeric_genes

monsanto sells a genetically modified corn product mon810 that expresses a bt_toxin with the same amino acid sequence claimed by bayer
in december 2000 monsanto filed a declaratory_judgment_action in the eastern_district of missouri seeking a declaration that its product did not infringe the ¡¬565 ¡¬ 372 ¡¬546 and ¡¬799_patent s and that these patents were invalid and unenforceable
bayer counterclaimed *1233 alleging infringement of certain claims in each patent
the district_court initially granted summary_judgment to monsanto holding that all four patents were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct that certain patent claims were invalid and that the ¡¬ 565 patent was not infringed
bayer appealed to this court
we reversed the trial courts claim_construction as to the term` bt2_toxin' and vacated the unenforceability and invalidity judgments
monsanto_co. v. bayer_bioscience_n.v. 363_f.3d_1235 fed.cir.2004 monsanto_i
in particular we held that the summary_judgment of unenforceability based on inequitable_conduct during the prosecution of the ¡¬799_patent was improper because there were material_facts in dispute and we concluded that the district_court erred in giving collateral estoppel effect to an earlier case between predecessors of the parties in this case and basing its invalidity findings on this estoppel

on remand bayer dismissed all claims that mon810 infringed the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s and filed a statement of non-liability as to these patents
accordingly when the case proceeded to trial only the ¡¬565_patent was at issue
the jury found the asserted claims of the ¡¬565_patent not infringed and invalid for obviousness and prior_invention by monsanto

subsequently the district_court held a four-day bench trial on inequitable_conduct
in a 99-page opinion the district_court found materiality and intent for two separate acts relating to the ¡¬565_patent and concluded that inequitable_conduct made the ¡¬565_patent unenforceable

( e.d.mo
aug._28,_2006 monsanto_ii
the court also found inequitable_conduct in the prosecution of the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s and accordingly held these patents unenforceable
id.at 95
bayer appealed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

in the current appeal bayer argues that the district_court erred in claim_construction that allegedly prejudicial evidence was admitted during the jury_trial that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the jury_findings of prior_invention and obviousness that the district_court erred in finding the ¡¬ 565 patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct and that the district_court lacked jurisdiction to find the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s unenforceable

because we affirm the district_courts holding that the ¡¬565_patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct we need not reach the other_issues raised by bayer relating to the jury_findings of invalidity and non-infringement of the patent
see espeed inc. v. brokertec usa l.l.c. 480_f.3d_1129 1138-39 fed.cir.2007
accordingly we review only the district_courts inequitable_conduct holdings

ii
when this court reviews an inequitable_conduct_determination` [ w ] e review the district_courts findings on the threshold issues of materiality and intent for clear_error'
cargill inc. v. canbra_foods ltd. 476_f.3d_1359 1365 fed.cir.2007
accordingly` the district_courts determination will be reversed only if there is adefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made'
id
the ultimate decision on inequitable_conduct is reviewed for abuse of discretion
on appeal bayer does not challenge the ultimate discretionary determination
therefore we review here only whether there was clear_error in the district_courts underlying materiality and intent findings

to hold a patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct a district_court must find by clear and convincing_evidence that *1234 a patent_applicant breached its duty of candor and good_faith to the united states patent and trademark_office` pto' by failing to disclose material_information or submitting false material_information with an intent to deceive the pto

once the requisite levels of materiality and intent have been proven a district_court` must balance the equities to determine whether the patentee has committed inequitable_conduct that warrants holding the patent unenforceable'
monsanto_i 363 f.3d at 1239

a
during the prosecution of the ¡¬565_patent bayer disclosed as prior_art an abstract by dr. wayne barnes entitled` a bifunctional gene for insecticide and kanamycin resistance' the` barnes_abstract' that had been prepared in 1985 for a large scientific conference at which barnes had made a presentation by displaying a poster presenting his findings the` barnes_poster'
the abstract read in relevant part we have found that the second_half of the bacillus thuringiensis toxin gene is dispensable for the expression of an active insecticide
not only may it be deleted the second_half of the gene may be replaced by the codons of the nptii kanamycin resistance from tn5 and both activities are expressed.. we have tailored transcriptional control signals from the [ agrobacterium ] t-dna of ptit37 so that this fused gene may be inserted in the place of the nopaline synthase codons adjacent to the right border signal from t-dna
this plant_gene should express the insecticide and kanamycin resistance from the same_promoter..

bayers application as amended following an initial rejection claimed any chimeric_gene comprising a plant_promoter linked to a truncated_bt_toxin_gene encoding a 60-80 kd_n-terminal_fragment of a bt_toxin in which the chimeric_gene could be expressed in the cell as an insect-controlling amount of bt_toxin
narrower dependent claims akin to the claims that ultimately issued specified that the chimeric_gene must encode a bt_toxin with a specified amino acid sequence.8 in addition the application claimed chimeric_genes encoding the bt_toxin fragment fused to a selectable_marker_protein
dependent claims included limiting the selectable_marker_protein to neomycin phosphotransferase` ntp-ii' an enzyme that provides resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin and limiting the` plant_promoter' to the nos_promoter which is the promoter_region from the t-dna_nopaline_synthase_gene

on march_21,_1994 the examiner rejected all claims including the sequence_specific_claims as obvious over various prior_art references including the barnes_abstract
in particular the examiner noted that the barnes_abstract
provided motivation to genetically engineer plant_cells with a truncated_bt_crystal_gene rather than using the full *1235 length sequence
in the absence of unexpected results it was obvious that a truncated version of the bt crystal protein would result in plants and plant_cells which were insecticidal since the art taught that only the n-terminal protein of the bt_protein i.e
the portion used by applicants was sufficient for insecticidal activity
furthermore fusion_proteins for truncated bt
crystal proteins with npt-ii were known as taught by barnes
the claims were also rejected for lack of enablement
the examiner noted that the prior_art showed that` expression of [ bt ] toxin genes in a plant cell is highly unpredictable' and concluded that` [ i ] n view of the unpredictability of expression of foreign_genes.. it does not appear that any bt_toxin_protein would be effective in plant_cells against any species of insect
consequently applicants broader claims are not enabled'

in reply to the office action bayer canceled its broadest claims and addressed both rejections
in order to overcome the barnes reference bayer argued barnes_et_al
fails to identify which bt
toxin gene should be utilized and also fails to show that the fusion gene would work in plants
also if the` second_half' of the bt2_gene would be deleted as barnes_et_al
suggests the remaining part would encode a protein of 576 amino acids which is not toxic
moreover the barnes_et_al
reference is not enabled since it is stated therein that the fused gene` may' be inserted into t-dna and that the plant_gene` should' express the insecticide and kanamycin resistance from the same_promoter
but no concrete_evidence is provided

on the enablement issue bayer argued that` [ t ] he problem of the unpredictability of expression of foreign_genes in plants that the examiner purports to exist has actually been solved by the present invention by providing truncated bt_genes
any protein expressed in a plant by inserting a dna encoding a truncated_bt_protein will inherently possess toxicity.. and thus the plants will be toxic to target_insects'
( emphasis added

although bayer disclosed the barnes_abstract during patent_prosecution it did not disclose the notes taken by one of its employees dr. celestina mariani regarding the barnes_poster to which the abstract was in reference nor the information contained in the notes
mariani had attended the conference and personally viewed barnes poster
she explained in her deposition which was presented at trial that the notes were made while in front of the poster and included copies of` the same schemes that were presented on the poster'
monsanto_ii slip op.at 19 quoting marianis deposition_testimony` mariani_depo`
the poster contained much more information than the abstract itself
id.at 24
in the deposition mariani carefully and extensively described the content of her handwritten notes
stepping through the figures and accompanying text she explained that her notes illustrated that barnes disclosed in his poster that he had a truncated a 3.4 kb bt_toxin_gene9 at or near the restriction enzyme site xho and discovered that this gene fragment encoded a n-terminus 67 kd truncated bt_toxin which retained toxicity ; b created a chimeric_gene which encoded a fusion of this truncated bt_toxin_protein and the npt-ii_protein ; c expressed this fusion_protein in a bacterial system and demonstrated that the expressed protein provided kanamycin resistance and was toxic to insects when applied to plants` in drops' ; and d inserted the gene for this fusion_protein into an agrobacterium *1236 t-dna plant expression vector creating a chimeric_gene comprising the nos_promoter the bt_toxin_gene fragment encoding a 67 kd toxin and the npt-ii_gene
id.at 19-24 quoting mariani_depo
marianis notes also stated that the chimeric construct was` not toxic if it is in leaves'
id.at 22 quoting mariani_depo
she explained in her deposition` i must assume thatin leaves then means they have done plant transformation but i can not remember exactly to be honest'
id.at 22 quoting mariani_depo
but she emphasized that the construct had been created and that the barnes group` surely w [ as ] busy with introducing in plants this cassette' since otherwise there would have been no reason to make the construct in the agrobacterium_t-dna system
id.at 24 quoting mariani_depo
the district_court found that marianis testimony demonstrated that she remembered` a great deal about the notes' and was clearly and articulately able to describe the contents of the barnes_poster as detailed in the notes
id.at 18.10

the mariani_notes were` widely circulated' among bayers bt group
dr. wouter meulemanns worked in the intellectual property department at bayer and was responsible for the prosecution of the four patents at issue
id
meulemanns admitted that he saw marianis notes during the prosecution of the ¡¬ 565 patent and remembers talking to mariani about the barnes_poster and her notes
he conceded that` if [ the mariani ] notes would add anything of reliable_information which could add to the abstract that could be important' to a patent_examiner
id.at 17-18 quoting meulemanns depo
however meulemanns stated that mariani was unable to remember` anything' about the presentation or poster during their conversation

the district_court in its memorandum and order following the inequitable_conduct bench trial carefully reviewed all of this evidence quoting extensively from the testimony of both meulemanns and mariani
the court found meulemanns testimony to stand in` sharp contrast' to marianis detailed deposition_testimony and determined that meulemanns was not credible in claiming not to have known nor understood the content of the notes despite having discussed them with mariani
and after quoting at length from dr. marianis deposition_testimony the district_court concluded [ i ] t is very obvious that the poster_notes if they were disclosed to the patent_examiner which they were not would stand in sharp_contradiction to the bayer argument before the patent_examiner..
the court finds from all of the evidence in the case that bayer had a duty of candor and good_faith to disclose the mariani_notes and intentionally withheld the information from the united states patent office examiner in the prosecution of the ¡¬565_patent with intention to deceive the pto_examiner
id.at 24

these findings were made in the section of the district_courts opinion entitled` findings of fact'
in the section entitled` discussion' the district_court returned to the question of the materiality of the mariani_notes
the court explained the court will not repeat the lengthy mariani recitation from above but it is clear that the barnes notes coded for the same 67 kd toxic protein bayer wanted to claim that the barnes gene *big_token__1237_was_3__big_token4 kb for the full length that because of the identified xho_site it would be easy to determine the identity of the bt_gene being used and the chimeric_gene used was toxic to insects by the drop
there is a substantial_likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would have considered the barnes notes important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent..
the barnes notes by themselves withheld by bayer from the pto_examiner if disclosed would establish a prima_facie_case of unpatentability of bayers claims under the ¡¬ 565 patent
id.at 97-98
accordingly the court concluded that` by clear and convincing_evidence for all of the reasons cited in this opinion' bayer made` a deliberate decision to withhold the known highly material reference with the specific_intent to deceive or mislead the pto_examiner'
id
the court emphasized that in reaching this determination it was relying on` all of the findings of fact stated in this opinion' not just those in the discussion_section
id.at 92

the district_court also found by clear and convincing_evidence that bayers representation to the pto that unpredictability of gene expression had been solved was false and misleading and was submitted to the pto_examiner with the specific_intent to deceive the pto
id.at 96

digital_control_inc. 437 f.3d at 1316.11

bayer argues that the` sole_basis' for the district_courts determination that the mariani_notes were material was the conclusion in one sentence of the discussion_section that the barnes construct` coded *1238 for the same 67 kd toxic protein bayer wanted to claim' and` that because of the identified xho_site it would be easy to determine the identity of the bt_gene being used'
bayer argues that these findings were clearly erroneous because they were based on the unsupported speculation that barnes was using the identical species of bt_toxin as bayer and that without this` erroneous finding of fact there can be no materiality'
we disagree

to begin bayer is correct that there is nothing in the record which would support a finding that the bt_toxin used by barnes was identical to the bt_toxin claimed in the issued ¡¬565_patent
however the district_court need not have found that barnes used the identical bt_toxin as bayer for the mariani_notes to be material
first at the time of the examiners rejection bayer was not limiting its claim to one species of bt_toxin_protein but was broadly claiming a chimeric construct encoding any 60-80 kd_n-terminal_fragment of a bt_toxin_protein
thus any species of chimeric_gene created by barnes within this genus would directly implicate the allowability of bayers claims
cf
eli lilly & co. v. barr labs. inc. 251_f.3d_955 971 fed.cir.2001 noting that a` genus claim limitation is anticipated by and therefore not patentably distinct from a [ ].. species claim'
second none of the examiners rejections including his rejections of the sequence_specific_claims nor any of bayers arguments to overcome these rejections relied on the exact_sequence of bt_toxin used by barnes
rather the issue was whether the barnes_abstract made bayers invention obvious absent unexpected results because barnes work with bt_toxin regardless of the specific species used provided motivation to genetically engineer plant_cells with` a truncated_bt_crystal_gene' and` taught fusion_proteins of truncated bt crystal proteins with npt-ii'
similarly the exact_sequence of the barnes protein is irrelevant to the question of whether bayers arguments to the pto interpreting the barnes_abstract were inconsistent with the information contained in the mariani_notes.12

moreover bayer is incorrect that the` sole_basis' for the district_courts materiality finding was the courts one sentence summary that the barnes construct coded for the` same 67 kd protein' as bayer claimed and the xho_site would make it easy to identify
bayer ignores that the very sentence in the analysis_section containing these two statements also repeats the courts critical finding that the mariani_notes showed that the barnes chimeric_gene was toxic when applied to plants as a drop.13 furthermore the district_court clearly stated that it was basing its finding *1239 of materiality not only on those facts discussed in the analysis_section but also on all the factual findings throughout the opinion.14 these included finding marianis deposition_testimony credible and illustrative of the` detail and scope of her notes and of her recollection of them'
and the district_court incorporated six pages of marianis testimony verbatim into its opinion
this testimony established that the barnes_poster as recorded in marianis notes disclosed that barnes had succeeded in making a fusion of the first 67 kd of a bt_protein and npt ii ; that this protein could be expressed and displayed kanamycin resistance and toxicity to insects when applied as a drop ; and that the gene encoding for this fusion_protein had been inserted into a t-dna_plasmid creating a chimeric_gene comprising a plant_promoter the truncated_bt_toxin_gene and the npt-ii_gene
based on marianis testimony the district_court found it` very obvious' that the poster_notes would stand in` sharp_contradiction' to bayers argument before the patent_examiner in which bayer argued that the construct described in the barnes_abstract was non-toxic and non-enabled

we see no clear_error in these findings
the undisputed evidence established that the arguments_bayer made to the examiner to overcome the rejection based on the barnes_abstract can not be reconciled with the information about the barnes_poster disclosed in the mariani_notes
first bayer argued to the examiner that he should read the barnes_abstracts statement that the` second_half' of the bt_toxin_gene is dispensable literally as referring to a gene of exactly half the length of the full length gene which for the bt2_gene would encode a 576 amino acid protein a size smaller than 67 kd and known to be too small to be toxic
this was perhaps a plausible if strained reading of the abstract itself
but the interpretation can not be reconciled with the additional_information disclosed about the barnes_poster in the mariani_notes
marianis notes demonstrated that the truncated protein referred to in the abstract was a 67 kd protein with proven insect toxicity
second bayer relied on the use of the word` may' in the abstract to argue that barnes had not enabled inserting the bt_toxin/npt-ii fusion gene into agrobacterium_t-dna because there was no` concrete_evidence' that the construct had been made
in contrast the mariani_notes disclosed that barnes had in fact created the described t-dna construct

in light of these discrepancies between the interpretation of the barnes_abstract bayer advocated and the information contained in the mariani_notes the mariani_notes clearly and convincingly` refute [ ] or [ are ] inconsistent with' a position the applicant took in opposing the examiners argument of unpatentability
37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 2 i
the notes are therefore material under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 2 i
see also bristol-myers squibb co. v. rhone-poulenc rorer inc. 326_f.3d_1226 1234 fed.cir.2003` [ m ] ateriality is not limited to prior_art but embraces any information that a reasonable_examiner would be substantially likely to consider important in deciding whether to allow an application to issue as a patent'
( quoting gfi inc. v. franklin corp. 265_f.3d_1268 1274 fed.cir.200115 since the notes meet the *1240 standard for materiality under ¡± 1.56 2 i there is no clear_error in the district_court finding the notes_material even though a part of the district_courts opinion viewed in isolation suggests that it may also have reached that conclusion based on an untenable reading of the notes as stating that the barnes_poster disclosed a gene coding for the same bt_toxin used by bayer
there is a substantial_likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would have considered the mariani_notes important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue

we hold that the mariani_notes are material because they directly contradict arguments_bayer made to the pto in support of patentability
we do not suggest that all internal documents of potential relevance must be submitted to the pto as a matter of course
rather it is the particular circumstances that render the internal documents material in this case
we need not decide whether as the district_court found they are also material because the notes by themselves would establish a prima_facie_case of unpatentability of the ¡¬565_patents claims
but certainly their materiality is augmented by the fact that marianis notes demonstrate in significantly more detail than the barnes_abstract that barnes had already disclosed that a 67 kd_n-terminal_fragment of a bt_toxin_protein retained toxicity either alone or fused to a npt-ii_protein and taught a chimeric_gene comprising the 67 kd bt_toxin_gene and a plant_promoter
bayer was attempting to claim a nearly identical invention-a chimeric_gene comprising a gene encoding a 60_to_80 kd bt_toxin_protein and a plant_promoter
accordingly we affirm the district_courts finding that the mariani_notes were highly material.16

c. bayers failure to disclose the highly material mariani_notes to the pto during the prosecution of the ¡¬565_patent is not sufficient to prove inequitable_conduct
rather clear and convincing_evidence must also establish an intent to deceive the pto
to prove intent` the involved conduct viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence of good_faith must indicate *1241 sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive'

id
; see also bruno_indep
living aids 394 f.3d at 1354 holding that an` inference of deceptive intent may fairly be drawn in the absence' of a` credible explanation for the non-disclosure' ; cf
dayco prods. 329 f.3d at 1367` intent to deceive can not be inferred simply from the decision to withhold the reference where the reasons given for the withholding are plausible
``

the district_court did not clearly err in finding that bayers` attempts to establish subjective good_faith sufficient to overcome the intent to mislead [ were ] not persuasive' and concluding that meulemanns intentionally withheld the material mariani_notes with the intent to deceive the pto
monsanto_ii slip op.at 97-98
meulemanns himself admitted that he was aware of the notes during the prosecution of the ¡¬565_patent that he had discussed the content of the notes with mariani and that the notes would have been important to the examiner if the notes contained reliable_information
the only explanation that meulemanns or bayer provided for failing to disclose the information contained in the notes was that the notes were not decipherable standing alone and that when meulemanns discussed the notes with mariani mariani had been unable to remember` anything' about them
the district_court however found this explanation to lack credibility particularly in light of marianis ability to testify with clarity and detail about the contents of the notes during her deposition
we find nothing clearly erroneous in the courts credibility finding

and absent a credible_reason for meulemanns to have not understood the content of marianis notes after having discussed them with mariani the district_court did not clearly err in inferring the requisite intent
see bruno_indep
living aids 394 f.3d at 1354
intent is easily inferred when as here an applicant makes arguments to the pto that it knows or obviously should have known are false in light of information not before the examiner and the applicant knowingly withholds that additional_information
see cargill inc. v. canbra_foods ltd. 476_f.3d_1359 1368 fed.cir.2007 holding that an applicants argument that the information was withheld in`good_faith does not negate an intent to manipulate the evidence' when` an applicant knows or obviously should know that information would be material to the examiner'

having found without clear_error that bayer intentionally withheld material_information when it failed to disclose the mariani_notes despite taking a position at the pto that was refuted by the information contained in the notes the district_court had discretion to hold the ¡¬565_patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
see hoffmann-la roche inc. v. promega corp. 323_f.3d_1354 1359 fed.cir.2003
*1242 as bayer does not challenge this discretionary decision we affirm the district_courts holding that the ¡¬565_patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct

because the failure to disclose the information in the mariani_notes was alone sufficient to support holding the ¡¬565_patent unenforceable we need not consider whether the statement bayer made during the prosecution of the patent that its invention had solved the problem of unpredictability of expression of bt_toxins in plants also amounted to inequitable_conduct

iii
the district_court also concluded that the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
bayer argues on appeal that the district_court did not have jurisdiction to hold these three patents unenforceable
we review questions of jurisdiction de novo
see e.g. pennington seed inc. v. produce exch
no._299 457_f.3d_1334 1338 fed.cir.2006

although monsanto initially sought a declaratory judgment that four bayer_patents were infringed bayer subsequently dismissed with prejudice its infringement claims under the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s and filed a statement of non-liability covenanting not to sue monsanto for past present or future infringement of these patents
even if filing such a covenant may divest the court of jurisdiction over a declaratory_judgment_action regarding these patents see amana refrigeration inc. v. quadlux inc. 172_f.3d_852 855 fed.cir.1999 ; fort james corp. v. solo cup corp. 412_f.3d_1340_(fed.cir.2005) under our precedent the district_court retained independent jurisdiction over monsantos request for attorney_fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
as this court recently explained while the covenant [ not to sue for infringement ] may have eliminated the case or controversy pled in the patent-related counterclaims and deprived the district_court of article iii jurisdiction with respect to those counterclaims the covenant does not deprive the district_court of jurisdiction to determine the disposition of.. the request for attorney_fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285
highway equip co. v. feco ltd. 469_f.3d_1027 1033_n._1_(fed.cir.2006) internal citation omitted ; see also h.r
techs. inc. v. astechnologies inc. 275_f.3d_1378 1385 fed.cir.2002

the parties do not dispute that the district_courts jurisdiction to rule on attorney_fees encompassed the jurisdiction to make findings of inequitable_conduct regarding all four patents
see brasseler u.s.a
i l.p. v. stryker sales corp. 267_f.3d_1370 1380 fed.cir.2001` a district_court may award reasonable attorney_fees to the prevailing party in a patent_infringement_case where the conduct of a party is deemed to beexceptional..
the prevailing party may prove the existence of an exceptional case by showing inequitable_conduct before the pto..' quoting 35 u.s.c.¡± 28517 the district_courts holding that the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s are unenforceable stemmed directly from its inequitable_conduct findings
see monsanto_ii slip op.at 95` the court.. finds by clear and convincing_evidence that the equities warrant a conclusion that.. bayer committed inequitable_conduct..
the ¡¬799_patent the ¡¬372_patent and the ¡¬546_patent are accordingly unenforceable`
*1243 the question facing this court is thus whether a district_courts jurisdiction under ¡± 285 to determine whether there was inequitable_conduct in the prosecution of patents that are otherwise no longer in suit confers on that court the jurisdiction to hold such patents unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
we hold that it does

a district_court has no discretion to decide whether a patent is unenforceable once it enters a finding of inequitable_conduct
to the contrary this court has long held that the unenforceability of a patent follows automatically once a patent is found to have been obtained via inequitable_conduct
kingsdown medical consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 877 fed.cir.1988 en banc in pertinent part` when a court has finally determined that inequitable_conduct occurred in relation to one or more claims during prosecution of the patent_application the entire patent is rendered unenforceable'
( emphasis added ; see also j.p. stevens & co. v. lex tex ltd. 747_f.2d_1553 1560 fed.cir.1984` if the court reaches th [ e ] conclusion [ that there was inequitable_conduct ] it must hold that the patent claims at issue are unenforceable`
any distinction between the two findings is merely semantic
as a result jurisdiction to decide whether a patent was obtained through inequitable_conduct necessarily includes the jurisdiction to declare a patent unenforceable as a result of that inequitable_conduct

in an opinion issued after the briefs were filed in the instant case but prior to oral argument this court explicitly held that a district_court has the power to declare patents that are no longer in suit unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
nilssen v. osram sylvania inc. 504_f.3d_1223_(fed.cir.2007)
in nilssen the plaintiff had originally alleged that the defendant infringed fifteen patents related to electrical lighting products but withdrew four of the patents shortly before trial
the district_court nevertheless held the four withdrawn patents unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in the process of determining whether the patents which remained in the suit were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
this court affirmed explaining that` [ b ] ecause inequitable_conduct with respect to one or more patents in a family can infect related applications we find no abuse of discretion in the district_courts holding the [ four patents no longer in suit ] unenforceable'
id.at 1230
in nilssen the jurisdiction of the court to reach the inequitable_conduct_inquiry for the withdrawn patents was itself in question because the district_court reached the issue only collaterally to determining whether there was inequitable_conduct regarding patents that remained in suit
here the outcome is even clearer as there is no dispute that the court had an independent grant of jurisdiction under ¡± 285 to consider inequitable_conduct relating to the withdrawn patents
the district_court therefore did not lack jurisdiction to hold the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s unenforceable.18

iv
we affirm the district_courts holding that the ¡¬565_patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct and we conclude that the court did have jurisdiction to declare the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s unenforceable
since we affirm the courts holding that the ¡¬565_patent is unenforceable we *1244 do not reach the remaining issues raised by bayer on appeal
the final_judgment of the district_court is therefore

affirmed

background on the science of genetically engineering plants to express bt_toxin can be found in our previous opinion mycogen plant science inc. v. monsanto_co. 243_f.3d_1316 1324 fed.cir.2001
2. kd or kilodalton is a measure of the molecular weight of a protein
3
when agrobacterium infects certain plant_cells it integrates a part of its dna the t-dna_plasmid into the genome of the plant
to genetically engineer a plant using the agrobacterium transformation method the foreign dna of interest is first introduced into the t-dna_plasmid
then the plant is infected with agrobacterium containing the modified t-dna leading to the introduction of the foreign segment into the plant cell genome
see in re goodman 11_f.3d_1046 1048 fed.cir.1993
when the encoding region of the foreign_gene is linked to a regulatory_region recognized by the plant cell machinery the transformed plant cell will be able to express the protein encoded by the foreign_gene
4
a chimeric_gene is an artificial i.e. human made gene created by linking together separate segments of natural or synthetic dna from different sources
5
not all bt_toxins have identical amino acid sequences
the sequence limitation added during the prosecution to overcome rejection limits bayers invention to chimeric_genes encoding a specific variant of bt_toxin of the bt2 class of toxins
6
the specification defines a gene naturally expressed in plants to include both those genes that are originally part of a plants genome and those genes which are introduced by agents such as bacteria and produce rna or protein in the absence of human intervention
¡¬565_patent col.big_token__9_ll._52__big_token -57
one plant_promoter disclosed in the specification is the promoter of the t-dna_nopaline_synthase_gene the` nos_promoter'
7
claims 2 5 and 8 of the ¡¬565_patent were at issue with claim 5 being representative
in independent form it recites 5
a chimeric_gene comprising 1 a dna_fragment encoding an insecticidal bacillus thuringiensis bt2_toxin of about 60 to about 80 kd wherein said bt2_toxin comprises the amino acid sequence id no._1 from amino_acid_position 1 to amino_acid_position 725 ; and
( 2 a promoter_region of a gene naturally expressed in plant_cells wherein said dna_fragment is under the control of said promoter_region
¡¬565_patent col.115
dependent claim 12 adds a limitation that the plant_promoter come from one of three genes including the nopaline synthase gene
id
8
the claims which ultimately issued as the ¡¬565_patent differ from these preliminary claims even those that are sequence specific in that they do not require that the bt_toxin be expressed in plant_cells at an insect-controlling amount but only that the bt_toxin_gene be` under the control of' the plant_promoter
bayer did not object to the district_courts holding and jury instruction that reduction to practice of the ¡¬565 invention did not require making plants which expressed an insecticidal bt_toxin
9. kb or kilobases is a unit of length equal to 1000 base pairs of dna
the bt2_toxin gene bayer was using was also approximately 3.4 kb
10
at trial mariani was much less forthcoming about the content of her notes than she had been in the deposition
the district_court however found her initial deposition_testimony more credible
monsanto_ii slip op.at 97
there is nothing clearly erroneous in this credibility finding
11
although all misstatements or admissions that satisfy rule 56 are considered material the converse is not true a misstatement or admission can be material for the purposes of showing inequitable_conduct even if it does not meet the standard for rule 56 if in the totality of the circumstances a reasonable_examiner would have considered such information important in deciding whether to allow the parent_application
see digital_control_inc. 437 f.3d at 1316` [ i ] f a misstatement or omission is material under the new rule 56 standard it is material
similarly if a misstatement or omission is material under thereasonable_examiner standard or under the older three tests it is also material`
12
indeed despite having canceled the broader claimssolely to expedite the prosecution of th [ e ] application and not to acquiesce to the rejection at the time bayer distinguished barnes it was continuing to argue that its disclosure of a chimeric_gene with one version of a truncated bt_gene was sufficient to enable the genus of all chimeric_genes with any truncated_bt_toxin_gene
see response to office action sept._28,_1994` any bt_protein expressed in a plant by inserting a dna encoding a truncated_bt_protein will inherently possess toxicity characteristics against its target_insect and thus the plants will be toxic to target_insects
it is well within the skill of the person in the art to select a particular bt_protein gene with an observed toxicity to a target_insect truncate the gene and express it to attain resistance against the target_insect`
bayer can therefore not now argue that only those prior_art references disclosing the particular bt_toxin described in the specification can be material
13
in its opening_brief to this court and again in its reply_brief bayers quotation of the sentence of the district_courts opinion upon which it places primary reliance leaves out this important final clause of the sentence and by failing to use ellipses makes it appear that it has quoted the entire sentence
such misquotation of text whether inadvertent or purposeful risks misleading this court and can not be of help to the client
14
accordingly we need not decide whether if the facts repeated in the analysis_section had been the only basis for a finding of materiality the district_courts finding would constitute clear_error
15
that the mariani_notes may have required some explanation by mariani to be fully understood does not alter their materiality
rather it is the information contained in them that makes the notes_material and which bayer in light of its interpretation of the barnes_abstract had an obligation to communicate to the pto
if an accompanying declaration by mariani was necessary to make the notes legible then the duty of candor would require disclosing both the notes and such a declaration
16
in bayers reply_brief bayer argues for the first time that even if its other arguments fail the mariani_notes lack materiality because they would have been` merely cumulative' in light of the prior_art reference of a gene article by dr. adang which` disclosed toxic genes encoding bt_proteins of about 67-68 kd'
we do not consider this argument as it has been waived
becton dickinson & co. v. c.r
bard inc. 922_f.2d_792 800 fed.cir.1990` [ a ] n issue not raised by an appellant in its opening_brief.. is waived`
even if we were to reach the issue bayers argument ignores that the materiality of the mariani_notes is based not only on the size of the protein disclosed in her notes but also on the notes disclosure that barnes had constructed a chimeric_gene containing a 67 kd fragment of a bt_toxin_gene fused to a kanamycin resistance gene attached to a plant_promoter
bayer overcame the adang gene reference by expressly arguing that it` fails to describe the development of a chimearic gene'
it can thus not now argue that the mariani_notes which do disclose a chimeric_gene are merely cumulative over the adang gene article
moreover unlike the mariani_notes nothing in the adang reference could refute bayers interpretation of the barnes_abstract
a reference can not be merely cumulative if there is no other reference which` refutes or is inconsistent with' a position the applicant has taken in opposing an argument of unpatentability
17
inequitable conduct regarding the three withdrawn patents was relevant to the question of attorneys fees because monsantos request for attorneys fees included fees accumulated before the three patents had been withdrawn
18
bayer does not in this appeal challenge the district_courts findings of inequitable_conduct regarding the ¡¬799 ¡¬372 and ¡¬546_patent s. therefore those findings are affirmed
we do not address the impact of those findings on the question of attorney_fees under section 285
