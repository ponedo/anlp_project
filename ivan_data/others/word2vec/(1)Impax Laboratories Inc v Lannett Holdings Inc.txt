background
triptans are selective serotonin receptor agonists developed in the early 1980s
the first triptan to be marketed was sumatriptan under the name imitrexthe_r which first became available in the u.s. in an injection form in 1993
in 1995 sumatriptan became available in an oral_tablet_form and later in 1997 in an intranasal form as imitrexthe_r sumatriptan nasal_spray` ns'
zolmitriptan is another triptan which first became available in the u.s. in an oral_tablet_form in 1999 under the name zomigthe_r
at that time there were several other_triptans that were either on the market or under development

astrazeneca owns and impax is the exclusive_licensee of the237 and767_patent s,1 which relate to formulations of zolmitriptan for intranasal_administration
the claims at issue in this appeal are directed to pharmaceutical_formulations intranasal_administration devices or aqueous_solutions of zolmitriptan
'237_patent col. 5_l._4 -col. 6_l._22 ;767_patent col. 5_l._8 -col. 6_l._25

claim 4 of the237_patent depends from claim 2 which in turn depends from claim 1
claims 1 2 and 4 of the237_patent read as follows 1
a pharmaceutical_formulation suitable for intranasal_administration which comprises zolmitriptan and a pharmaceutically acceptable_carrier wherein the ph of the formulation is in the range 4.big_token__5_to_5__big_token5
2
a pharmaceutical_formulation according to claim 1 wherein the ph of the formulation is 5
4
a pharmaceutical_formulation according to claim 2 wherein the formulation is buffered
'237_patent col. 5_ll._4 -9 12-13

similarly claims 6_and_15 of the767_patent read 6
a pharmaceutical_formulation suitable for intranasal_administration which comprises zolmitriptan and a pharmaceutically acceptable_carrier wherein the ph of the formulation is in the range 3.big_token__5_to_5__big_token5 wherein the formulation is buffered by a mixture of citric acid and disodium_phosphate
15
an aqueous_solution of zolmitriptan in a buffer at a ph of less than 6.0
'767_patent col. 5_ll._23 -27 col. 6_ll._21 -22

other formulation claims of the237 and767_patent s at issue include similar limitations with regard to ph ranges and buffering and some formulation claims include additional_limitations relating to sterility
*1376237_patent col. 5_l._4 -col. 6_l._22 ;767_patent col. 5_l._8 -col. 6_l._25
these additional_limitations are not at issue on appeal

astrazeneca owns the new drug application` nda' for zomigthe_r zolmitriptan nasal_spray 2.5 mg/spray and 5 mg/spray approved by the u.s. food and drug administration` fda' for treatment of migraine
the237 and767_patent s are listed in connection with zomigthe_r_nasal_spray in the fdas approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations commonly known as the` orange book'

in 2012 astrazeneca and impax entered into an agreement for distribution license development and supply of the zomigthe_r_products
the agreement granted to impax an exclusive license to astrazenecas patents covering the zomigthe_r_products including the237 and767_patent s in return for the payment of $ 130 million and additional payments at varying royalty rates including 40 % on the nasal_spray
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1039 ; j.a
2204-05

in june 2014 lannett notified astrazeneca that it had filed an abbreviated_new_drug_application` anda' seeking approval for a generic version of zomigthe_r_nasal_spray making a certification according to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv` paragraph iv certification' alleging noninfringement and/or invalidity of the237 and767_patent s

in july 2014 appellees filed suit against lannett in the district of delaware for infringement of the237 and767_patent s pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a
in december 2015 the district_court issued its claim construction opinion and order
the court agreed with appellees that the preamble of` [ a ] pharmaceutical_formulation suitable for intranasal_administration' is limiting

9-10
the court also adopted appellees construction of` zolmitriptan' as meaning its chemical name and structure declining to adopt lannetts proposed construction that would include` ionic and covalently bonded forms thereof that preserve the pharmaceutical activity of the structure'

the court however agreed with lannett regarding the construction of the word` buffer' adopting the` functional definition' proposed by lannett id.at *4-7 ; j.a
9 and adopted the parties agreed-upon constructions of` disodium_phosphate' and` ph of the formulation is 5' j.a

in september 2016 a four-day bench_trial was held on the issues of infringement and validity
following the bench_trial the parties stipulated that lannetts product described in its anda with a target ph of 5 if approved by the fda will infringe the237 and767_patent s. impax_labs inc. v. lannett_holdings_inc. no._114-cv-00984-rga d._del
sept._29,_2016 ecf_no._1 37

in march 2017 the district_court issued its decision on validity holding that lannett failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted claims were invalid
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1030
the court first made factual_findings on the teachings of the prior_art_references namely sumatriptan ns international publication no
wo 99/64044` marquess' u.s._patent 6,326,401 and its counterpart french publication no
fr 2773489 together` chauveau'2 and stewart tepper & alan rapoport the triptans a summary 12 5 cns drugs *1377 403-417 nov. 1999` tepper & rapoport'
id.at 1032-34

the district_court then determined that lannett failed to prove that claim 4 of the237_patent and claim 15 of the767_patent were anticipated by marquess or chauveau as neither of the references disclosed all the limitations of the claims
id.at 1034-35
the court also determined that lannett failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the claims at issue would have been obvious over the prior_art
id.at 1035-44
in reaching the nonobviousness_conclusion the court found that 1 the prior_art including chauveau taught away from formulating zolmitriptan for intranasal_administration because zolmitriptan was known to be active not by itself but through its more potent_metabolite 183c91 ; 2 the prior_art at the time failed to teach that zolmitriptan by itself as contrasted with its metabolite would have been effective ; and 3 a skilled_artisan would not have been motivated to make with a reasonable_expectation of success nasal_formulations of zolmitriptan
id.at 1036-39 ; see also id.at 1032 n.3
the court also found that sumatriptan does not have an active_metabolite and that` [ o ] nly two other_triptans eletriptan and almotriptan have active_metabolites but their metabolitesdo n't really contribute at all to the efficacy of those drugs
zolmitriptan stands alone in the class of triptans as having an active more potent_metabolite'
id.at 1033 quoting appellees expert dr. alan rapoport citation omitted

the district_court also considered evidence of objective_indicia of nonobviousness
id.at 1039-43
it found that the 2012 agreement between impax and astrazeneca supported a showing of nonobviousness but found any further secondary_considerations evidence inconclusive
id
ultimately after noting that` [ t ] he question of obviousness is a close_one' the court determined that lannett had failed to meet its burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
id.at 1043-44
following the decision on the issue of validity the court entered final judgment and an injunction in favor of appellees
j.a
1-4

lannett timely appealed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
as an initial matter we note that lannett no longer argues anticipation as a defense and does not challenge the district_courts claim constructions on appeal
also lannetts invalidity_arguments relying on international publication no
wo 98/02186` penkler' and european publication no
ep 0636623` robertson' which were not raised or developed either before the district_court or on appeal in its opening_brief are waived
smithkline_beecham corp. v. apotex corp. 439_f.3d_1312 1319-20 fed
cir
2006
we further note that because the courts nonobviousness decision applied commonly to all of the challenged claims the court did not and needed not make separate decisions on the validity of the claims at issue
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1030-31 1032 n.2
similarly on appeal the parties do not make separate arguments on validity,3 and thus all of *1378 the claims at issue rise and fall together with the issue of whether it would have been obvious to make zolmitriptan into a nasal_spray

we proceed to the obviousness issue the sole issue on appeal based on the prior_art_references and arguments properly before us
on appeal from a bench_trial we review a district_courts conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear_error

on appeal lannett contends that the district_court erred in concluding that the claims at issue would not have been obvious based on an erroneous finding that the prior_art taught away from nasal_formulations of zolmitriptan
according to lannett the court improperly disregarded express teachings in the prior_art
lannett also argues that the court erred in finding that the 2012 agreement which encompassed the entire zomigthe_r franchise including matters unrelated to the patents at issue supported its conclusion of nonobviousness
lannett alleges that it made a strong showing of obviousness and therefore even accepting the district_courts findings of teaching away and objective_indicia of nonobviousness the court still erred in its ultimate conclusion of obviousness

appellees respond that the district_court did not err because it correctly found that a skilled_artisan would not have been motivated to make nasal_formulations of zolmitriptan or had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so
appellees contend that the courts finding of teaching away was not clearly erroneous and at any rate lannett failed to prove obviousness by clear and convincing_evidence
according to appellees the courts factual_findings including those relating to secondary_considerations were supported by record_evidence and based on credibility determinations concerning the parties experts and such evidence should not be reweighed on appeal

we find no reversible_error in the district_courts decision that lannett failed to *1379 prove invalidity of the asserted claims by clear and convincing_evidence
the courts decision was supported by its underlying_factual_findings which we do not find clearly erroneous
because the question of the level of ordinary_skill in the art is undisputed we proceed to the remaining parts of the obviousness_analysis

i
a. lannett contends that the prior_art expressly discloses nasal_formulations of zolmitriptan and it faults the district_court for failing to consider the prior_art` as a whole'
appellants br
31
lannett argues that prior_art_references in particular chauveau,4 expressly disclosed using zolmitriptan in a nasal_spray
lannett urges that the courts discounting of chauveaus express mention of zolmitriptan in connection with nasal_formulations constituted clear_error
we disagree

chauveau is generally directed to formulating an active_ingredient using capryl caproyl macrogol_glycerides a version of which is marketed under the name labrasolthe_r for oromucosal administration of the active_ingredient
chauveau_col. 2_ll._5 -16 col. 3_ll._18 -21
as the district_court noted chauveau discusses that its teachings can be applied to formulations for buccal nasal or pharyngeal administration among which the nasal route is preferred
id
col. 1_ll._5 -6 col. 2_ll._27 -29 col. 3_ll._60 -67 col. 5_ll._8 -15
chauveaus teachings seek to provide pharmaceutically effective formulations for active_ingredients that would be degraded by oral administration particularly in the gastrointestinal tract
id
col. 1_ll._10 -31 48-52
the court found that chauveau` offers a laundry list of potential active_ingredients' including` over twenty-five categories or examples of medications'
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1033 citing chauveau_col. 2_l._38 -col. 3_l._14
at the end of the list chauveau states that` [ t ] he active substance can also be in particular an antimigraine active substance such as a triptan such as sumatriptan or zolmitriptan'
chauveau_col. 3_ll._12 -14
the example formulations described in chauveau include is 159 tryptamine-5-o-carboxymethyl-tyrosyl-glycinamide as the active_ingredient but not zolmitriptan
id
col. 4_ll._10 -28 col. 5_l._4 7-col. 9_l._18

lannett is correct that in an obviousness_analysis prior_art should be viewed as a whole
takeda chem indus. ltd. v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1358 fed
cir
2007
however chauveau as a whole is not about intranasal_formulations of zolmitriptan which is barely mentioned
it is about formulations of a wide variety of compounds with capryl caproyl macrogol_glycerides
zolmitriptan is mentioned once with no further mention in an example or claim
moreover properly *1380 viewing the prior_art as a whole the district_court here made additional findings beyond the fact that zolmitriptan was barely mentioned in chauveau
specifically the court found that the prior_art taught that zolmitriptan has a` unique attribute' in that its` [ f ] irst pass metabolism results in an active_metabolite 183c91 which is two to eight times more powerful than zolmitriptan itself'
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1036-37
the court credited appellees expert dr._rapoport who provided his opinion on the state of the prior_art in support of this finding
id
the court also noted that lannetts expert did not dispute the relevance of zolmitriptans active_metabolite in considering whether to develop zolmitriptan formulations
id.at 1037
it is also undisputed that sumatriptan does not have an active_metabolite
see id.at 1033

lannett nevertheless argues that the district_court erred in finding that the effectiveness of zolmitriptan` relied on' its active_metabolite appellants br
41-45 and puts forth arguments to discount the significance of zolmitriptans active_metabolite
in particular lannett argues that triptans are specifically designed to act as serotonin receptor agonists which by itself would rebut the contention that zolmitriptan was understood to be ineffective without the contribution of its metabolite
we disagree particularly because lannetts contentions are without any evidentiary_support beyond its attorney arguments concerning factual issues
ferring b.v. v. watson labs. inc.-fla. 764_f.3d_1401 1406-07 fed
cir
2014 rejecting a conclusory obviousness argument without evidentiary_support

contrary to lannetts contentions the district_court found that zolmitriptans more potent active_metabolite was actually thought to be significant for its efficacy by a person of skill in the art at the time
specifically the court credited appellees evidence of expert testimony and studies and found that a skilled_artisan would have expected delayed or lower therapeutic effectiveness from zolmitriptan if administered nasally because it would have been` absolutely counterintuitive to make a nasal_spray when you have an active_metabolite which is more potent.. than the drug itself'
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1037 quoting dr._rapoport ; j.a
667
as such the court found that` because of zolmitriptans reliance on its active_metabolite the prior_art failed to teach that zolmitriptan by itself would be effective'
id
the court thus found zolmitriptans acting through its metabolite not only relevant which was substantially undisputed but also significant for a skilled_artisan to consider regarding whether to make intranasally administered zolmitriptan

in view of the totality of the record_evidence of the state of the prior_art we can not find that the district_court clearly erred in its findings
far from disregarding the prior_arts discussion of zolmitriptan the court specifically considered and acknowledged that zolmitriptan was mentioned in connection with nasal_formulations and sprays
however the court also properly considered additional record_evidence to make findings on the state of the prior_art as a whole

both parties put forth evidence of various factors a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have considered
ultimately the district_court found that a skilled_artisan would not have been motivated to make a zolmitriptan_nasal_spray with a reasonable_expectation of success
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1038-39 ; see id.at 1043-44
`` the presence or absence of a motivation to combine references in an obviousness determination is a pure question of fact' and` [ w ] hat a reference teaches and whether it teaches toward or away from the claimed invention are questions *1381 of fact'

in particular the court here found that` a skilled_artisan would look to any of the other_triptans before looking to zolmitriptan to develop a pharmaceutical_product that would not take advantage of first_pass_metabolism'
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1037

based on the record before us we do not find that the court clearly erred in concluding that at the time zolmitriptans known significant reliance on its active_metabolite would have on balance dissuaded a person of skill in the art from making nasal_formulations of zolmitriptan
see e.g. winner int l royalty corp. v. wang 202_f.3d_1340 1349-50 fed

cir
2016 no clear_error when the district_court found that a person of skill in the art would have pursued other formulations

b
the district_court also considered evidence of secondary_considerations including the 2012 license agreement between impax and astrazeneca covering the zomigthe_r_products for which impax paid $ 130 million
the court found that this 2012 agreement favored appellees as it found a nexus between the agreement and the237 and767_patent s. however it found that appellees other evidence of secondary_considerations was inconclusive

lannett argues that the district_courts analysis is unsupported by any evidence as the court without any support did its own nexus analysis
we disagree
the court found that the patents covering the oral formulations of zolmitriptan expired in only a little more than one year after the effective date of the 2012 agreement but the patents covering the nasal_formulations of zolmitriptan i.e. the237 and767_patent s were not set to expire until 2021
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1039
based on the timing of the 2012 agreement as it related to the various formulation patents and the sales data presented to the court it found that` a portion of the $ 130 million had to be based on expected profits from zomig nasal_spray'
id.at 1040
also contrary to lannetts suggestion the court did rely on corroborating evidence showing a nexus between the patents at issue and the licensing including impaxs press_release stating that impax` look [ s ] to build sales of the zomigthe_r nasal_spray dosage form'
id
( quoting the press_release ; j.a
2405
thus there was adequate nexus between the intranasal patents and $ 130 million
to the extent that lannett invites us to analyze the 2012 agreement and reweigh evidence we decline to do so
in view of other underlying_factual_findings discussed above it is sufficient for us to find that the court did not clearly err in finding that the 2012 agreement is at least in part attributable to the patents at issue

ii
we finally consider whether the district_court reached a legally erroneous conclusion of nonobviousness
the court called this case indeed a` close_one'
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1043
the court stated that on the one hand as a` promising migraine treatment' various aspects of zolmitriptan` would have been encouraging to a skilled_artisan motivated to make an anti-migraine nasal_spray better than imitrex'
id
on the other hand the court stated that` zolmitriptan had a known powerful metabolite the creation of which would be delayed and diminished by nasal administration' of zolmitriptan which` would point a skilled_artisan away from including zolmitriptan in a nasal_spray'
id
the court found appellees experts *1382 more credible than lannetts and ultimately was not convinced that lannett had shown that the patents were invalid
id.at 1044
we are unconvinced that the court erred in that judgment

contrary to lannetts suggestion it has not shown a` strong' case of obviousness and has not proven obviousness by clear and convincing_evidence
procter & gamble 566 f.3d at 994
we are not left with a firm_conviction that the district_court erred in its underlying_factual_findings as discussed above
indeed the court weighed the evidence before it and made findings for and against both appellees and lannett
we do not and should not reweigh evidence or make factual_findings anew on appeal
see teva_pharm usa inc. v. sandoz inc. -- - u.s. -- -- 135_s.ct._831 838 -- - l.ed.2d -- -- 2015` a district_court judge who has presided over and listened to the entirety of a proceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain that familiarity than an appeals court judge who must read a written transcript or perhaps just those portions to which the parties have referred
``

ultimately we agree that this case was close
but we defer to the district_court in its fact findings including what chauveau discloses and the state of the prior_art as a whole
and we are especially persuaded by the testimony of appellees expert dr._rapoport on which the district_court relied who opined that it would have been` absolutely counterintuitive' to make an intranasal_formulation of zolmitriptan given that its activity primarily came from its metabolite and the agreement between astrazeneca and impax covering the intranasal product and its patents for which the latter paid $ 130 million
we therefore conclude that the district_court did not commit reversible_error in its nonobviousness_conclusion

the district_court did not clearly err in its underlying_factual_findings and we agree with the district_court that lannett failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the claims of the237 and767_patent s are invalid
we have considered all the other arguments raised in the briefs but have not been persuaded that the district_court erred in its conclusions

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the judgment of the district_court

at the district_court lannett alleged lack of standing and ownership issues regarding the237 and767_patent s among different astrazeneca entities and their effect on the licensing_agreement between impax and astrazeneca
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1028-30

in its opening_brief lannett appears to suggest that the district_courts nonobviousness_conclusion with respect to claim 15 was in error because claim 15 merely requires an` aqueous_solution'

however beyond this oblique reference in its opening_brief lannett does not separately argue invalidity of claim 15 until its reply brief

lannett alludes to tepper & rapoport as supporting the similar proposition that the prior_art taught nasal_formulations of zolmitriptan without making any particular_invalidity_argument based on tepper & rapoport
appellants br
17-18
thus we find any invalidity_argument relying on tepper & rapoport waived smithkline_beecham 439 f.3d at 1319-20 ; at any rate we find no clear_error in the district_courts finding that the statement that a zolmitriptan_nasal_spray being` under development' in tepper & rapoport was a mere` passing reference' opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1034
`` [ u ] nder development' does not mean developed with an expectation of success
lannett also similarly alludes to marquess for the same proposition without making any particular_invalidity_argument based on marquess
appellants br
18-19
similarly any invalidity_argument based on marquess is waived
smithkline_beecham 439 f.3d at 1319-20
moreover the court correctly found that marquess did not disclose the claimed nasal_formulation of zolmitriptan according to the courts construction of` zolmitriptan' which is unchallenged on appeal
opinion 246 f.supp.3d at 1034-35
