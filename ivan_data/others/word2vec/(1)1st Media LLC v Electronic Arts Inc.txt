opinion
linn circuit_judge
1st_media llc` 1st_media' is the assignee of u.s._patent_no._5464,946` ¡¬946_patent` and appeals from the united_states_district_court for the district of nevadas dismissal of 1st_medias complaint alleging infringement of the ¡¬946_patent by electronic_arts inc. harmonix_music_systems inc. viacom inc. and sony_computer_entertainment_america llc collectively` appellees'
1st_media v. dopi karaoke inc. no._07- cv-1589 apr._23,_2010` 1st_media`
the court found that during prosecution of the ¡¬946_patent the named inventor dr. scott lewis` lewis' and his attorney joseph sawyer` sawyer' withheld from the united_states patent and trademark office` pto' three material_references and information about pto rejections in two related prosecutions thereby committing inequitable_conduct and rendering the ¡¬946_patent unenforceable
because the record contains no evidence of a deliberate_decision to withhold those references from the pto as required under therasense inc. v. becton dickinson & co. 649_f.3d_1276_(fed.cir.2011) en banc and because appellees admit that the record is complete this court reverses

i
background
the ¡¬946_patent is titled` system and apparatus for interactive multimedia entertainment' and covers an entertainment_system for use in purchasing and storing songs videos and multimedia_karaoke_information
on lewiss behalf sawyer filed the application that led to the ¡¬946_patent` ¡¬946_application' on november 13 1992
on september 14 1994 the examiner rejected all claims of the ¡¬946_application as anticipated or obvious in view of five prior_art_references
to overcome the rejections sawyer argued on february 21 1995 that the claimed entertainment *1370 system included a multimedia_call_processing_system an element not found in the cited references
he also amended current_claim 16 to limit it to karaoke devices
the examiner responded by issuing a notice of allowance on may_2,_1995 ; sawyer paid the issue_fee on august 1 1995 ; and the pto issued the ¡¬946_patent on november 7 1995

while the ¡¬946_application was pending sawyer prosecuted a number of other patent applications for related inventions made by lewis
the applications relevant to this appeal are 1 international patent application no
pct/us93/10930` pct_application' ; 2 u.s. patent application no._07 /975,824 which became u.s._patent_no._5325,423` ¡¬423_patent` and ; 3 u.s. patent application no._08 /265,391 which became u.s._patent_no._5564,001` ¡¬001_patent`

the pct_application as filed on november 11 1993 was identical to the as filed ¡¬946_application but was never amended to add the karaoke limitation
in a june_25,_1995 supplemental search report a european patent office` epo' examiner cited as prior_art international publication wo 90/01243` bush' noting that bush was a category` y' reference meaning it was particularly relevant if combined with another document of the same category
sawyer received the supplemental european report citing bush on july_24,_1995 eight days before he paid the issue_fee for the ¡¬946_patent
neither lewis nor sawyer ever disclosed the bush_reference to the pto and bush was not considered during the course of examination of the ¡¬946_application
the epo ultimately rejected the pct_application on november 3 1998 citing bush as the closest prior_art document

lewis filed the application that led to the ¡¬423_patent` ¡¬423_application' on the same day as the ¡¬946_application
large portions of the ¡¬ 423 patents specification are identical to the ¡¬946_patent
those portions include descriptions of terms lewis coined-' interactive multimedia mastering system'` imm' a` multimedia_call_processing_system'` mcps' and` interactive multimedia devices'` imd'
compare ¡¬946_patent col. 4_l._62 -col. 11_l._63 with ¡¬423_patent col. 6_l._4 -col. 13_l._24
on july_16,_1993 an examiner rejected several claims of the ¡¬423_application as anticipated by u.s._patent_no._5027,400` baji' which discloses what the examiner considered to be an imm mcps and imd-the same components of the karaoke device covered by claim 16 of the ¡¬946_patent
on october 29 1993 sawyer responded to the rejection by cancelling the rejected claims
the ¡¬ 423 patent issued on june_28,_1994
neither lewis nor sawyer ever disclosed baji to the pto and the pto did not consider the reference during prosecution of the ¡¬946_patent

on june_24,_1994 lewis filed the application leading to the ¡¬001_patent` ¡¬001_application' as a continuation-in-part of the ¡¬423_application
on june_12,_1995 an examiner contended that the imm mcps and imd structures to the extent claimed were disclosed in u.s._patent_no._5220,420` hoarty' and rejected independent claim 1 of the ¡¬001_application as obvious in view of hoarty
on september 12 1995 sawyer replaced claim 1 with new claim 40 distinguishing hoarty while retaining the imm mcps and imd limitations
the ¡¬001_patent ultimately issued on october 8 1996
neither lewis nor sawyer ever disclosed hoarty to the pto and the pto did not consider the reference during prosecution of the ¡¬946_patent

on november 29 2007 1st_media filed a complaint in the united_states_district_court for the district of nevada alleging infringement of at least claim 16 of the ¡¬946_patent
appellees asserted an inequitable_conduct_defense and also counterclaimed *1371 for declaratory_judgment of inequitable_conduct
the court bifurcated the case focusing initial proceedings on the question of inequitable_conduct
1st_media moved to put its evidence on first arguing that` [ c ] ommon sense dictates that a patentee should inform the court of the background circumstances of patent procurement before an infringer steps in to attack the patentee'
pl
's mot
in limine # 1 to confirm the normal order of proofs at 2 1st_media aug._21,_2009 ecf no._204
appellees opposed the motion arguing that because they had the burden to prove inequitable_conduct they should present their evidence first
the court agreed with the appellees and held a bench trial on february 25_and_26 2010 allowing appellees to begin with a direct_examination of lewis

at trial appellees alleged five incidents of inequitable_conduct three based on the failure to cite references and two based on the failure to disclose rejections in the ¡¬423 and ¡¬001_patent prosecutions that respectively brought to light two of those references
because the appellees do not rely on appeal on the non-disclosure of the rejections themselves as a basis for affirming the district_courts decision we consider those grounds conceded and address only the allegations of inequitable_conduct relating to the three references noted
appellees br
55_n._18

with respect to the three references both lewis and sawyer testified that they did not appreciate the materiality of any of them
lewis testified under direct_examination by appellees that nondisclosure of the bush_reference was` an oversight that got lost in the cracks at that time and was n't a conscious decision not to report [ it ]'
tr
of inequitable_conduct_hr g day one at 183 1st_media feb._25,_2010 ecf no._267` day one tr`
although sawyer testified that he could not recall why he did not disclose the bush_reference appellees pointed to his previous declaration in which he claimed that` the bush publication itself never sparked an awareness or belief in my mind that bush should be disclosed'
tr
of inequitable_conduct_hr g day two at 134 1st_media feb._26,_2010 ecf no._270` day two tr`
sawyer also testified that he generally considered patentability issues in a case only during what he termed` active prosecution' or the time between the first office action and the notice of allowance
id.at 149
during the time_period that sawyer was prosecuting the ¡¬946_patent he had newly set up a solo office out of his home and characterized his practice as being at times` very active'
id.at 153 sawyers testimony that he was handling about 170 open prosecution files by the end of 1995
as for the baji and hoarty references lewis and sawyer each testified that the technology in the co-pending ¡¬423 and ¡¬001_applications was so distinct from the ¡¬946_application that it did not occur to them to disclose baji or hoarty during prosecution of the ¡¬946_patent

the district_court found their explanations not credible
findings of fact and conclusions of law following trial on inequitable conduct at 4 1st_media apr._23,_2010 ecf no._276` findings'` dr._lewis and mr._sawyer offered explanations for their failure to disclose the material prior_art.. that were not credible.. mr._sawyers explanation like dr._lewis.. was neither factually nor legally sufficient to explain the failure to disclose the bush_reference which was highly material
`` ; id.at 4-5` as to baji [ and ] hoarty.. dr._lewis and mr._sawyer suggested that they viewed the technology at issue in their co-pending applications as so distinct from that of the ¡¬946 application.. thatit did not occur to them to make any disclosures about baji [ or ] hoarty.. that explanation which defied common sense in light of the extensive overlap in *1372 the applications and claims was fully discredited at trial`
the district_court found that lewis and sawyer knew the references were material and concluded that because they failed to provide a credible good_faith_explanation for nondisclosure of the references it was appropriate to infer that they intended to deceive the pto during prosecution of the ¡¬946_patent
id
the district_court thus concluded that lewis and sawyer committed inequitable_conduct
the court allowed appellees to draft proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law
the court adopted those findings verbatim granted appellees requested declaratory_judgment of inequitable_conduct held the ¡¬946_patent unenforceable and dismissed 1st_medias complaint
1st_media appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

analysis
this courts recent opinion in therasense changed the standard for proving inequitable_conduct based on nondisclosure of a reference to the pto
649 f.3d at 1290-91
under the therasense standard absent affirmative egregious misconduct a defendant must prove by clear and convincing_evidence both of the` separate requirements' that 1` the patentee acted with the specific_intent to deceive the pto' ; and 2 the non-disclosed reference was but-for material
id
therasense explained that in order to show that the patentee acted with the specific_intent to deceive the pto a defendant must prove` that the applicant knew of the reference knew that it was material and made a deliberate_decision to withhold it'
id.at 1290 emphasis added
a failure of proof on any element precludes a finding of inequitable_conduct
see id
(` proving that the applicant knew of a reference should have known of its materiality and decided not to submit it to the pto does not prove specific_intent to deceive'
( emphasis added
`` [ t ] o meet the clear and convincing_evidence standard the specific_intent to deceive must bethe single most reasonable_inference able to be drawn from the evidence
`` id
( quoting star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1366
a court can no longer infer intent to deceive from non-disclosure of a reference solely because *1373 that reference was known and material
id
moreover a patentee need not offer any good_faith_explanation for his conduct unless and until an accused infringer has met his burden to prove an intent to deceive by clear and convincing_evidence
see id
; star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1368

the district_court issued its opinion in this case before this courts therasense opinion and this court must now determine whether under the standard set forth in therasense the record here supports the district_courts conclusion that lewis and sawyer committed inequitable_conduct

1st_media argues that the district_courts finding of inequitable_conduct can not be sustained because the court did not find that either lewis or sawyer made a deliberate_decision to withhold the three known material_references from the pto
1st_media accuses appellees of conflating the requirement to show intent to deceive with the requirement to show materiality and argues that star_scientifics single most reasonable_inference standard can not substitute for therasenses requirement that the defendant prove that the patentee made a deliberate_decision to withhold a known material_reference in order to deceive the pto
finally 1st_media cites bose corp. v. consumers union of united_states inc. 466_u.s._485 512 104_s.ct._1949 80_l.ed.2d_502_(1984) to argue that the appellees can not satisfy their burden to show a deliberate_decision to withhold references merely from the fact that the testimony of lewis and sawyer was discredited

appellees admit that they have no direct evidence that lewis or sawyer intended to deceive the pto
see oral arg.at 32:23 available at http //www
cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/2010-1435/all
they contend instead that the way in which lewis and sawyer became aware of the references coupled with statements they made during prosecution of the ¡¬946_patent demonstrate the necessary mens rea from which the district_court permissibly could have inferred a deliberate_decision to withhold the references regardless of the exact words the district_court used
see therasense 649 f.3d at 1291
appellees also argue that by seeking to present its evidence and explanations first at trial 1st_media conceded that appellees had made a threshold showing of intent to deceive
finally appellees argue that the record adequately supports the district_courts credibility determinations and its determination that both lewis and sawyer failed to provide a good_faith_explanation for their nondisclosure of the references in question

1
order of proof at trial
as an initial matter 1st_medias motion to present its proofs first did not concede that appellees had met their threshold_burden of showing an intent to deceive by clear and convincing_evidence
see id.at 1290
nothing in 1st_medias motion can be construed as a concession that appellees had met that burden
1st_medias motion was a procedural_request to implement what it believed would be an orderly and efficient presentation of evidence
appellees request for this court to read something substantive into 1st_medias procedural_request lacks justification
thus we turn to the merits of each alleged act of inequitable_conduct

2
bush
1st_media argues that the evidence fails to support an inference of an intent to deceive the pto by lewis and sawyers failure to disclose the bush_reference
1st_media specifically points to sawyers testimony that he did not learn of bush until after he received the notice of allowance of the ¡¬946_patent and at a time_period when *1374 his practice was` very active'
moreover 1st_media emphasizes that bush was reported as being a category` y' reference and therefore of particular relevance only when combined with some other reference
finally 1st_media points out that sawyers foreign patent counsel` wright' indicated that bush was of limited relevance

appellees stress that the district_court rejected lewiss and sawyers explanations
see findings at 4-5 16-18
they contend that the district_court was free to conclude that sawyer made a deliberate_decision to withhold bush based on the fact that he received the epo_search_report identifying bush and identifying` specific page line and figure numbers in bush as particularly relevant to as-filed claims 1-big_token__5_and_18__big_token of the epo counterpart' eight days before he paid the issue_fee for the ¡¬946_patent
appellees br
13 emphasis added
finally appellees disagree with 1st_medias characterization of the` y' designation and 1st_medias interpretation of wrights comment
according to appellees sawyer was already aware of other_references with which bush might be combined and wrights comment meant that bush was only relevant to certain claims specifically claim 16 of the ¡¬946_patent

at trial appellees argued that they met their threshold_burden of showing lewis and sawyers intent to deceive the pto regarding bush by demonstrating that lewis and sawyer knew of its relevance but did not disclose it to the pto
day one tr.at 40` they knew bush was relevant to claim 18 [ current_claim 16 ] according to the european patent office but they did n't disclose it to [ the examiner ] who was also you [ sic ] looking at the exact same claim
thats a prima facie showing of inequitable_conduct'
( emphasis added
the district_court accepted this argument
see findings at 7` intent may be inferred where non-disclosed information is material and where knowledge of the information and its materiality is chargeable to the applicant
`` ; id.at 16` the materiality of the bush_reference and the knowledge of that materiality by dr._lewis and mr._sawyer have been proven by clear and convincing_evidence
where the party asserting inequitable_conduct establishes a threshold_level of materiality and intent based on predicate facts the inquiry next turns to the.. [ patentees ] explanation that its conduct was in good faith
``

as noted supra this court has now made clear that` [ t ] o prevail on a claim of inequitable_conduct the accused infringer must prove that the patentee acted with the specific_intent to deceive the pto'
therasense 649 f.3d at 1290
moreover` [ a ] finding that the misrepresentation or omission amounts to gross negligence or negligence under ashould have known standard does not satisfy this intent requirement'
id
( citing kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 1988`
'in a case involving nondisclosure of information clear and convincing_evidence must show that the applicant made a deliberate_decision to withhold a known material_reference
`` id
( quoting molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1181 1995
the district_courts` intent to deceive' analysis regarding bush analyzed only` 1
knowledge of materiality' and` 2
lewis and sawyers explanations'
findings at 15-18
significantly however the district_court following pre-therasense precedent did not discuss or consider whether there was any deliberate_decision on either lewiss or sawyers part to withhold the bush_reference from the pto

this court can not sustain the district_courts decision
knowledge of the reference and knowledge of materiality alone are insufficient after therasense to show an intent to deceive
moreover it is *1375 not enough to argue carelessness lack of attention poor docketing or cross-referencing or anything else that might be considered negligent or even grossly negligent
to sustain a charge of inequitable_conduct` clear and convincing_evidence must show that the applicant made a deliberate_decision to withhold a known material_reference'
molins 48 f.3d at 1181
whatever one might conclude about lewiss and sawyers conduct and interactions relating to the bush_reference and the nature of sawyers practice at the relevant time the record does not support the inference that lewis and sawyer deliberately chose to withhold bush
see therasense 649 f.3d at 1290
lewis did not testify that he thought that bush was relevant to the ¡¬946_patents prosecution in 1995 ; he only testified that he knew of` some rejections related to a patent in europe and it was the bush patent'
day one tr.at 92
but the pct_application was not rejected based on bush until 1998
lewis could not recall whether he had reviewed the epo_search_report identifying bush ; he testified only that the report is something that he would have reviewed if sawyer had sent it to him
id.at 93
the record does not contain any letter from sawyer to lewis at that time informing lewis of the epo_search_report or bush
oral arg.at 19:45-20:25
lewis then testified that` given the details of the bush [ reference ] that [ he ] know [ s ] now' he now thinks that bush was` relevant'
id.at 100

while sawyer testified that it was his standard practice to make sure he cited to the pto prior_art cited in corresponding foreign applications if he knew that prior_art was material day two tr.at 129-30 appellees point to no evidence to suggest that sawyer must have deliberately withheld bush from the pto

the record in this case is unlike that in aventis pharma s.a. v. hospira inc. 675_f.3d_1324 1335-36 fed.cir.2012 in which this court affirmed the district_courts inequitable_conduct determination
in that case there was affirmative conduct by the applicants showing not only specific awareness of materiality but careful and selective manipulation of where when and how much of the most material information to disclose
id.at 1336
evidence of such selective_disclosure is not present here
with regard to bush the evidence shows at best that lewis and sawyer knew bush was material
an applicants knowledge of a references materiality however can not by itself prove let alone clearly and convincingly prove that any subsequent non-disclosure was based on a deliberate_decision
otherwise the third element in therasenses intent to deceive analysis would be satisfied in any case in which the second element was satisfied
this would effectively eviscerate therasenses test for mens rea and reinflict the plague of patent unenforceability based on the thinnest of speculation regarding the applicants putative mental state
see therasense 649 f.3d at 1290

the district_courts analysis in this case thus falls short of what therasense now requires
we need not decide whether it was clear_error for the district_court to infer that lewis and sawyer knew that the bush_reference was material because nowhere in the district_courts analysis did it cite any evidence of a deliberate_decision to withhold bush from the pto or anything that would support such an inference
and the district_court clearly erred in relying on lewis and sawyers inability to offer a good_faith_explanation as a basis to infer a deliberate_decision to withhold bush
see therasense 649 f.3d at 1290 ; see also am
calcar 651 f.3d at 1335` although the court found [ the inventors ] testimony to be lacking in credibility and we give considerable deference to that finding.. that alone is insufficient to find specific_intent to deceive under the *1376 knowing and deliberate standard'
( internal citation omitted ; star_scientific 537 f.3d at 1368` the patentee need not offer any good_faith_explanation unless the accused infringer first carried his burden to prove a threshold_level of intent to deceive by clear and convincing_evidence
``

3
baji
the district_courts intent to deceive analysis regarding baji is similarly flawed
appellees argue that lewis and sawyer were aware of baji based on its citation in a july_13,_1993 rejection of claims in the ¡¬423_application
they further contend that baji discloses an mcps and that lewis and sawyers february 21 1995 argument to the pto that the five references cited by the examiner do not have an mcps is sufficient circumstantial evidence from which the district_court could infer a deliberate_decision to withhold baji
1st_media_counters by pointing to lewiss and sawyers testimony that they did not appreciate the materiality of the baji reference and that they each viewed the inventions claimed in the ¡¬423 and ¡¬946_applications to relate to distinct technologies
moreover 1st_media contends that even if the district_court did not credit lewiss and sawyers testimony that fact can not be used as affirmative_evidence of the opposite conclusion

we agree with 1st_media
here there is no evidence such as the evidence of a selective_disclosure that occurred in aventis pharma suggesting that lewis and sawyer must have deliberately withheld baji
675 f.3d at 1336
that lewiss and sawyers testimony was not credited by the district_court does not overcome the shortcomings in appellees proof
and the fact that baji was not mentioned in an argument dealing with a rejection based on five other_references nearly a year and a half after baji first came to lewiss and sawyers attention does not in and of itself suggest that the single most reasonable_inference is a deliberate_decision to deceive
the district_courts contrary finding is clearly erroneous

4
hoarty
finally appellees argue that lewis and sawyer intended to deceive the pto by not disclosing hoarty which an examiner cited in a june_12,_1995 rejection of claims in the ¡¬001_application
appellees fault lewis and sawyer for not disclosing hoarty when the examiners rejection clearly drew their attention to imm imd and mcps networks contended to be similar to networks disclosed in the hoarty reference
1st_media_counters by citing lewiss and sawyers testimony that they did not appreciate hoartys materiality and by arguing that hoarty is not analogous to the invention claimed in the ¡¬946_application

appellees argument again falls short
hoarty was not brought to the attention of lewis and sawyer until after they had made the argument during prosecution of the ¡¬946_patent and received the notice of allowance albeit before they paid the issue_fee
moreover the record shows that the imm imd and mcps limitations were not determinative of patentability of the ¡¬001_patent meaning that there was nothing to single out hoarty for special attention
at bottom there is simply no evidence that lewis and sawyer deliberately withheld hoarty from the pto and there can be no inference that they intended to deceive the pto

ultimately for all of the references the evidence supports only that lewis and sawyer 1 knew of the references 2 may have known they were material which this court does not reach and 3 did not inform the pto of them
but that is not enough
as therasense made clear a defendant must prove that an applicant 1` knew of the reference' 2` knew it was *1377 material' and 3` made a deliberate_decision to withhold it'
649 f.3d at 1290 emphasis added
it is the last requirement that is missing from the record developed in this case

at oral argument appellees admitted that they took full discovery on inequitable_conduct and informed this court that the record is complete
oral arg.at 19:20-20:50
because appellees can not prove on this record that either lewis or sawyer made a deliberate_decision to withhold references from the pto and because appellees acknowledged that the record is complete this court reverses
we need not decide whether any of the references were but-for material

conclusion
for the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district_court is reversed

reversed
