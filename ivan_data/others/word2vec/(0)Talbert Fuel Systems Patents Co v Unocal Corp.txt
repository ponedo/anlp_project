pauline newman circuit_judge
this case was remanded by the supreme_court for further consideration1 in light of the courts decision in festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 535_u.s._722 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944 62_uspq2d_1705_(2002)
the vacated decision talbert_fuel_systems_patents_co. v. unocal_corp. 275_f.3d_1371 1376-78 61_uspq2d_1363 1366-68 fed.cir.2002 had affirmed the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the central_district of california,2 holding that 1 the claims of talberts united states patent_no._5015,356 the ¡¬356_patent are limited to a hydrocarbon_fuel with a high-end boiling_point of 345¢Xf 2 prosecution_history estoppel precludes infringement under the doctrine of equivalents and 3 talberts ¡¬356_patent and unocals patent_no._5288,393 are not interfering patents
in talbert this court had relied on the absolute bar established in festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 234_f.3d_558 56_uspq2d_1865_(fed.cir.2000) en banc to deny talbert access to the doctrine of equivalents
the supreme_courts vacatur of that decision led to this gvr
*1357 we now return to this case in light of this courts recent decision interpreting and applying the courts festo_decision
see festo_corp. v. shoketsu_kinzoku_kogyo_kabushiki_co. 344_f.3d_1359_(fed.cir.2003) en banc

i
the issue of infringement of talberts ¡¬356_patent is focused on the limitation of all of the claims to a gasoline boiling_point_range of 121¢Xf-345¢Xf as in claim 1 1
a low reid vapor pressure liquid gasoline for use in a standard carbureted internal combustion engine ; said gasoline comprising a priming agent and a hydrocarbon_mixture having an intermediate_carbon_range relative to c4-c12 fuel ; said intermediate_carbon_range consisting essentially of c6-c10 hydrocarbons with c9 and c10 paraffinic hydrocarbons being present in the mixture ; said gasoline having a boiling_point_range of 121¢Xf-345¢Xf at 1 atmosphere pressure.. emphasis added
the accused unocal_fuels were stated at trial to have boiling_range endpoints of from 373.8¢Xf to 472.9¢Xf

talbert again argues for literal infringement stating that the 345¢Xf upper limit in the claims was included` only to confirm the gasolines predominant c6-c10 composition and to establish cut ranges for the fuels gasifier form'
talbert states that` [ t ] o interpret that temperature_range as a restriction or requirement regarding the presence of all the low- or high-end components contradicts the reality of accepted refinery practice and renders the claim meaningless'
talbert points out that the specification recognizes and teaches that small_amounts of hydrocarbons outside the claimed c6-c10 range may remain due to the imprecision of fractionation [ the preferred intermediate range c6-c10 gasoline ].. can be made by removing the volatile and heavy components so that the remaining hydrocarbon_mixture will boil within a range of about 121¢Xf-345¢Xf at one atmosphere
such a boiling_point_range encompasses the boiling_point of the lowest boiling c6 component and the highest boiling c10 component
of course it is possible that a small_amount of c4 c5 c11 and c12 may remain after the separation process due to imperfections of gasoline fractionation procedures
'356_patent col. 7 lines 39-48
thus talbert argues that the 345¢Xf limit is` nothing more than a recognition that the highest boiling c10 hydrocarbon i.e. paraffinic decane must be present in the claimed composition' and that the claims correctly construed do not exclude the presence of higher boilers in relatively small_amounts

in construing the claims even accepting talberts view that gasoline fractionation does not readily achieve or require an exact endpoint the prosecution_history does not permit a claim scope that departs significantly from the stated temperature_range
the temperature_limit was placed in the claims at the examiners insistence to distinguish prior_art that included a hamilton_reference that showed hydrocarbon_fuels with an endpoint` within the range of about 390¢Xf and about 420¢Xf'
talbert had argued to the examiner that` the temperature_range of the boiling_points of the hydrocarbons of the gasoline of the presently claimed invention is between 96.8¢Xf and 345¢Xf'
to gain allowance talbert was required to place the temperature restriction in the claims

talbert presented no reasonable explanation of how his designated endpoint of 345¢Xf is correctly construed to include fuels with endpoints of 373¢Xf and higher
we therefore affirm the district_courts *1358 ruling that the claims are not literally infringed

ii
infringement by application of the doctrine of equivalents was the basis of the gvr
talbert_requests_remand to the district_court for retrial in view of the courts change in the law
unocal responds that prosecution_history estoppel as established by the courts festo_decision bars talberts attempt to reach the unocal_fuels and that remand is inappropriate

in festo the court applied the principles of prosecution_history estoppel to claims that had been narrowed by amendment reaffirming that estoppel` hold [ s ] the inventor to the representations made during the application process and to the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the amendment'
festo 535 u.s. at 737-38 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944 62 uspq2d at 1712
the prosecution_history of the ¡¬356_patent shows narrowing amendments directed to the hydrocarbon content and boiling_range of the fuel
talberts claims as initially filed contained no temperature_range 1
a gasoline fuel comprising hydrocarbons having an intermediate_carbon_range relative to gasoline which has a carbon range of c4-c12 ; said intermediate range being defined as the portion remaining when c4-c12 gasoline has removed therefrom an effective_amount of lower weight volatile components to substantially eliminate evaporative loss and explosion potential and an effective_amount of higher weight to raise the burn rate of the remaining hydrocarbons to a level comparable to c4-c12 gasoline
the claims were rejected on references that showed gasoline of various hydrocarbon contents and boiling_ranges including the hamilton_reference which showed an upper boiling limit in the range of 390¢Xf-420¢Xf
talbert argued to the examiner that
there is no disclosure in hamilton which suggests the removal of lighter and heavier hydrocarbons from a gasoline type fuel to produce a fuel consisting essentially of hydrocarbons in the range of c5-c10 having the boiling_range set forth in the claims
in fact hamilton teaches away from such a fuel by providing for a fraction having a boiling_range up to 390¢Xf column 1 lines 42-43
this fraction is not the same as nor equivalent to that which is the subject of applicants composition claims
talbert then limited the claims to up to c10 hydrocarbons and at the examiners insistence added a boiling_range of 121¢Xf-345¢Xf
the district_court concluded that hydrocarbons boiling above 345¢Xf were disclaimed by talbert in order to obtain the patent and imposed an estoppel commensurate with this conclusion

talbert argues that the temperature_limit was placed in the claims to distinguish the hamilton_reference and applied only to gasifier applications and not to the standard carbureted fuel to which the ¡¬356 claims are directed
talbert argues that` citation of [ the gasifier fuels ] prosecution_history is irrelevant' because the two types of fuels are very different stating` although the substantial elimination of the higher-boiling c11+ hydrocarbons is important for gasoline requiring a gasifier those physical properties are not required of standard gasolines which contain primers to help provide adequate front-end volatility to start engines'
thus talbert argues that the 345¢Xf limit that was added to the claims does not raise an estoppel to reaching the equivalent unocal standard carbureted fuels that contain c11_hydrocarbons and boil above 345¢Xf

talbert_requests_remand to the district_court in order to provide evidence that persons of skill in the gasoline fractionating art would know that a hydrocarbon_fuel described by its carbon number such as c6 to c10 when distilled will contain *1359 some c11_hydrocarbons that boil above 345¢Xf
talbert states that the 345¢Xf limit does not describe the actual composition that is distilled and would be so recognized
talbert argues that this evidence would also show that talbert did not disclaim coverage of gasolines having an endpoint higher than 345¢Xf

talberts patent was prosecuted before festo was decided by the supreme_court and on gvr the patentee may provide evidence not previously relevant
however in this case the proffered evidence viewed favorably to talbert does not overcome the clarity of the disclaimer of fuels boiling in the range of the hamilton_reference viz. from 80f up to the endpoint range of 390¢Xf-420¢Xf
nor can talbert avoid the teaching in the ¡¬356 specification that standard carbureted fuel is the same as gasifier fuel` except for the presence of a small_amount of priming agent' in the carbureted fuel
col. 9 lines 19-23
talbert has not suggested that persons reading the specification would recognize that statement as incorrect or as affecting the boiling_point_range of the claimed talbert fuels

we conclude that the amendment of the talbert claims to a boiling_point upper limit of 345¢Xf in light of the hamilton_reference showing gasolines with boiling endpoints of 390¢Xf-420¢Xf is a presumptive surrender of gasolines boiling in the range between talberts amended endpoint of 345¢Xf and hamiltons endpoints
see festo 535 u.s. at 740-41 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944 62 uspq2d at 1714
in festo the court established the grounds of rebuttal of the presumption of surrender arising from a narrowing amendment the court stating that` [ t ] he patentee must show that at the time of the amendment one skilled in the art could not reasonably be expected to have drafted a claim that would have literally encompassed the alleged equivalent'
id
three general criteria of rebuttal were established by the court the equivalent may have been unforeseeable at the time of the application ; the rationale underlying the amendment may bear no more than a tangential relation to the equivalent in question ; or there may be some other_reason suggesting that the patentee could not reasonably be expected to have described the insubstantial substitute in question
id
talbert requesting remand states that the record thus far adduced in the district_court does not deal with these aspects of rebuttal for they were not relevant to the issues as then perceived
however the prosecution_history shows and precedent confirms that these rebuttal criteria can not be met

when the prior_art embraces the alleged equivalent and a narrowing amendment was made to avoid that equivalent that subject_matter can not be found to have been unforeseeable at the time of the amendment
pioneer magnetics inc. v. micro linear corp. 330_f.3d_1352 1357 66_uspq2d_1859 1862 fed.cir.2003
the boiling_range limits of the unocal_fuels starting at 373.8¢Xf are directly within the space between the 345¢Xf limit of talberts amended claims and the 390¢Xf of the hamilton_reference
the amendment was required by the examiner to distinguish the higher boiling fuels in view of talberts explicit disclaimer of such fuels
the issue was extensively discussed in the prosecution_record for the examiner persisted in this rejection
it can not now be credibly argued that it was unforeseeable that fuels with a boiling_range significantly higher than 345¢Xf approaching the prior_art fuels would be equivalent to the fuels as limited by talberts amendments
in view of talberts clear disclaimers of such higher-boiling fuels the now-asserted equivalence can not be deemed to have *1360 been unforeseeable when talberts amendments were made

turning to the courts second potential ground of rebuttal the reason for talberts amendment can not be deemed` tangential' to the unocal alleged equivalent
the boiling_range and carbon content were at issue during prosecution and were the direct not tangential reason for the narrowing amendments to these claim limitations
this courts remand decision in festo 344 f.3d at 1369-70 generally prohibits evidence outside the prosecution_record in deciding this ground of rebuttal
on the intrinsic evidence` tangentialness' is not an available ground

as for the courts third potential ground of rebuttal no` other_reason' for avoiding estoppel has been proffered
talbert argues that the claims contain an unnecessarily exact boiling limit ; if so the court is without power to make such a correction
see autogiro company of america v. united states 181_ct.cl._55 384_f.2d_391 396 1967` courts can neither broaden nor narrow the claims to give the patentee something different than what he has set forth`
the precision or generality with which boiling_point_ranges or fractionating temperatures are stated is not a matter of the` imprecision of language' the courts words in festo 535 u.s. at 740-41 122_s.ct._1831 152_l.ed.2d_944 62 uspq2d at 1714 but a measurable property of matter in a well-studied field of engineering
we conclude that the presumption of surrender of the range between talberts amended claims and the prior_art can not be rebutted as to the unocal_fuels and that remand is unwarranted

in addition the classical principles of the doctrine of equivalents preclude a finding of equivalency for such finding requires only insubstantial_differences between the invention as claimed and the alleged equivalent
see warner-jenkinson co. v. hilton davis chem co. 520_u.s._17 39-40 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146 41_uspq2d_1865 1875 1997 ; eagle comtronics v. arrow communication labs. inc. 305_f.3d_1303 1315 64_uspq2d_1481 1488 fed.cir.2002` an element in the accused product is equivalent to a claim limitation if the differences between the two areinsubstantial to one of ordinary skill in the art`
the unocal_fuels do not simply depart by a few degrees from 345¢Xf but have` true boiling_point endpoints ranging from 373.8¢Xf to 472.9¢Xf'
thus even were talbert to provide evidence that might overcome the festo presumption of estoppel no reasonable trier of fact could find only insubstantial_differences between fuels having an endpoint of 345¢Xf and fuels with the endpoints shown for the unocal_fuels

iii
the district_court refused to declare an interference as provided by 35 u.s.c.¡± 291 between any claim of the talbert patent and unocals patent_no._5288,393 ruling that there was not identity of subject_matter
we have considered talberts argument that unocal simply uses a different method of describing its fuel ; however talbert has not shown the identity of invention required for declaration of interference
the district_courts ruling on this issue is affirmed

conclusion
the judgment of the district_court is again affirmed

each party shall bear its costs

affirmed
