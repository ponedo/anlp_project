clevenger circuit_judge
plaintiff-appellee national_steel_car ltd.` national_steel_car' or` nsc' sued defendants-appellants canadian_pacific railway ltd. canadian_pacific_railway_company 3942503 canada inc. and delaware *1322 and hudson_railway_company inc. collectively` canadian_pacific' or` cpr' in the eastern_district of pennsylvania for infringement of u.s. patent no._4951,575` the ¡¬575_patent`
nsc moved for a preliminary_injunction and the district_court granted nscs motion holding inter alia that nsc had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that cprs defense to infringement under 35 u.s.c.¡± 272 lacked substantial_merit and that cprs invalidity_defense did not raise a substantial_question
see nat l steel car ltd. v. canadian pac
ry. ltd. 254_f.supp.2d_527 e.d.pa.2003
after careful review of the district_courts opinion the record and the arguments advanced by the parties we conclude that cprs defenses demonstrate substantial challenges to nscs allegations and we reverse the district_courts preliminary_injunction

i
the ¡¬575_patent assigned to national_steel_car a manufacturer of railway_cars addresses a particular type of railway_car used to haul lumber a depressed_center-beam_flat_car
figure 1 of the ¡¬575_patent shows a longitudinal section through one side of the car and is reproduced below

?
the car described in the ¡¬575_patent is a` center-beam' car because the primary structure of the car is a truss-like beam element that runs the length of the center of the car between the wheel assemblies or` end_truck_assemblies' in the front and back of the car
center-beam_cars are an industry standard for hauling lumber which is piled onto a floor that extends laterally to each side of the car from the bottom of the center_beam and then secured to the center_beam
canadian_pacific currently operates a fleet of center-beam_flat_cars

the car described in the ¡¬575_patent is a` depressed' or` drop-deck' car because the portion of the floor between the end_truck_assemblies is lowered relative to the height of the floor over the end_truck_assemblies
the drop-deck_center-beam_flat_car has two advantages over the non-drop-deck version
first it can carry a volumetrically larger load
given the relatively low density of wood ordinary center-beam_cars reach volume capacity before they reach weight capacity leaving each car inefficiently under-loaded in terms of weight
second the dropping of the deck lowers the cars center of the gravity permitting safer loading transit and unloading because a higher center of gravity renders the car more vulnerable to tipping

nsc alleges infringement of claims 1-3 5-9 and 20-23 of the ¡¬575_patent
claims 1 2_and_20 are independent claims each using different structural aspects of the invention to define the claims scope
because the district_court construed only a limited number of claim_terms and based its invalidity conclusion on only those terms we need not reproduce an exhaustive list of the asserted claims
claims 1 *big_token__1323_and_5__big_token are thus representative and the construed claim_terms are emphasized 1
a flat_car supported on end_truck_assemblies comprising
a body formed by a longitudinally extending center_sill a draft sill attached to each end of said center_sill and a pair of bulkheads mounted at each end side_sill means disposed on opposite_sides of said center_sill on said body a vertical_center_beam_assembly extending upward from said center_sill said vertical_center_beam_assembly including an upper_center_sill extending parallel above said center_sill between said bulkheads said upper_center_sill being supported by a plurality of columns carried by at least said center_sill and
floor means being arranged between said opposite side_sill means said floor means having end_floor_sections lying in a first generally horizontal_plane and an intermediate_depressed_floor_section disposed in a second generally horizontal_plane lying below said first_horizontal_plane said side_sill means includes a pair of side_sill_assemblies disposed on opposite_sides of said center_sill each of said side_sill_assemblies includes a pair of upper_end_sections extending along an upper_axis and an intermediate_section extending along a lower_axis disposed below said first_axis for supporting said intermediate_depressed_floor_section

canadian_pacific is a canadian railroad company1 that owns rail lines in canada and in the united_states and operates trains on these lines
on may_21,_2002 cpr issued a request for quote for a new fleet of depressed_center-beam_flat_cars
although nsc was among the three companies that submitted bids cpr awarded a contract for 525 cars to greenbrier a united_states company with a trentonworks production facility in canada at which the cars were to be produced
the contract was based on greenbriers gbrx 20003 model of a depressed_center-beam_flat_car.2 the contract was for a total of over $ 21 million and included a broad provision under which greenbrier agreed to defend patent-infringement_suits brought against cpr to indemnify cpr against all damages in any such suit and to provide a suitable remedy should use of the cars be enjoined

cpr intends to use the gbrx 20003 depressed_center-beam_flat_cars in the same way that it uses its current_fleet of 2,900 lumber-carrying center-beam_flat_cars.3 ninety percent of cprs lumber shipments travel from canada to the united_states ; the remaining ten percent are performed entirely within canada
because *1324 there is no market need for american lumber to be shipped into canada cpr center-beam_flat_cars return to canada empty 99.2 percent of the time
measured either on the basis of days or track mileage traveled a center-beam_flat_car is in the united_states approximately 56_to_57 percent of the time

to service destinations in the united_states cpr engines pull the cpr_cars as far as cpr-owned track extends into the united_states
if the destination lies beyond the end of the cpr track the cpr_cars are switched at an interchange_point such as chicago illinois to trains powered by locomotives owned by united_states railroads
at an interchange_point cpr_cars from the same incoming train may end up on different trains heading to different united_states destinations

iii
during the course of the bidding process on canadian_pacifics fleet of depressed_center-beam_flat_cars national_steel_car apprised cpr of the existence of the ¡¬575_patent and indicated that it was prepared to protect its patent_rights
less than a month after cpr informed nsc that its bid had not been accepted nsc filed the complaint initiating the instant suit alleging infringement of claims 1-3 5-9 and 20-23 of the ¡¬575_patent based on cprs intended use of the drop-deck_center-beam_flat_cars in the united_states.4 nsc moved for a preliminary_injunction against cpr and after an expedited discovery period and an evidentiary hearing the district_court granted the motion
the district_courts preliminary_injunction enjoins cpr` from making using offering to sell or importing the gbrx 20003 depressed_center_beam_flat_car in the united_states'

in the preliminary_injunction proceedings before the district_court cpr conceded that limitations in the claims of the ¡¬575_patent read on the gbrx 20003
the questions considered by the district_court in its analysis of nscs likelihood of success on the merits therefore focused on cprs defenses to patent_infringement
the district_court held that neither of the two defenses raised by cpr had substantial_merit
cpr first claimed that 35 u.s.c.¡± 272 defines cprs use of the accused cars as noninfringing
section 272 titled` temporary_presence in the united_states' provides that the use of an invention in a vehicle` entering the united_states only temporarily or accidentally shall not constitute infringement of any patent' provided certain conditions are met
35 u.s.c.¡± 272 2000
the district_court held both that the gbrx 20003 would not be` entering the united_states only temporarily' as per cprs description of its intended use of the cars and that several of the additional conditions were not met
cpr also claimed that the ¡¬575_patent was invalid as anticipated and as obvious in light of the prior_art but the district_court determined that neither contention presented a substantial_question precluding the entry of a preliminary_injunction

cpr appealed in a timely fashion and we have jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡±¡± 1292 c 1 and 1295 a 1

iv
a preliminary_injunction is a` drastic and extraordinary remedy that is not to be routinely granted'
intel corp. v. ulsi sys
tech. inc. 995_f.2d_1566 1568 fed.cir.1993
to obtain a preliminary_injunction in the district_court the moving party must demonstrate a reasonable *1325 likelihood of success on the merits irreparable_harm in the absence of a preliminary_injunction a balance of hardships tipping in its favor and the injunctions favorable impact on the public interest
see jack guttman inc. v. kopykake enters. inc. 302_f.3d_1352 1356 fed.cir.2002 ; amazon.com inc. v. barnesandnoble.com inc. 239_f.3d_1343 1350 fed.cir.2001
although in some instances` [ t ] hese factors taken individually are not dispositive' because the district_courts conclusion results from a process of overall balancing hybritech inc. v. abbott labs. 849_f.2d_1446 1451 fed.cir.1988 a movant is not entitled to a preliminary_injunction if he fails to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.5 see amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350 noting that both` case law and logic' establish the likelihood of success on the merits and the irreparable_harm factors as necessary showings to obtain a preliminary_injunction
in other_words a district_court can not use an exceptionally weighty showing on one of the other three factors to grant a preliminary_injunction if a movant fails to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits

to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits nsc must show that` in light of the presumptions and burdens that will inhere at trial on the merits' id. 1 nsc will prove that the limitations of the ¡¬575_patent read on the gbrx 20003 and 2 nscs infringement claim will likely withstand cprs defenses to infringement and challenges to the validity of the ¡¬575_patent
because cpr concedes the former we consider only the latter
thus if cpr` raises a substantial_question concerning either infringement or validity i.e. asserts an infringement or invalidity_defense that the patentee can not provelacks substantial_merit the preliminary_injunction should not issue'

the final grant or denial of a preliminary_injunction is within the sound discretion of the district_court see id.at 1350 citing novo_nordisk of n
am. inc. v. genentech inc. 77_f.3d_1364 1367 fed.cir.1996 and will be reviewed on appeal only for an abuse of discretion see oakley inc. v. sunglass hut int l 316_f.3d_1331 1338-39 fed.cir.2003
however in reviewing the district_courts reasoning justifying that action we review factual findings for clear_error conclusions of law de novo and the exercise of a district_courts discretion for a clear_error of judgment in weighing relevant factors
see id.at 1339 ; amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350 quoting novo_nordisk 77 f.3d at 1367
as a necessary corollary to this standard of review` [ t ] o the extent that a district_courts decision to grant a preliminary_injunction hinges on questions of law [ our ] review is de novo'
mylan pharm inc. v. thompson 268_f.3d_1323 1329 fed.cir.2001

v. we first address canadian_pacifics defense to infringement under section 272
the statutory_interpretation of section 272 presents an issue of law that we review without deference
see imazio nursery inc. v. dania greenhouses 69_f.3d_1560 1564 fed.cir.1995

section 272 entitled` temporary_presence in the united_states' provides as follows *1326 the use of any invention in any vessel aircraft or vehicle of any country which affords similar_privileges to vessels aircraft or vehicles of the united_states entering the united_states temporarily or accidentally shall not constitute infringement of any patent if the invention is used exclusively for the needs of the vessel aircraft or vehicle and is not offered for sale or sold in or used for the manufacture of anything to be sold in or exported from the united_states
in gross section 272 provides that the use of certain foreign-owned means of transit or transport entering into the jurisdiction of the united_states` temporarily or accidentally' is not an infringing use provided a host of conditions are satisfied
cpr argues that its intended use of the gbrx 20003 drop-deck_center-beam_flat_cars in the united_states is within the scope of conduct detailed in section 272 and that its use of the cars therefore does not constitute infringement of the ¡¬575_patent
the district_court disagreed identifying four provisions in the text of section 272 each of which placed cprs intended use of its rail_cars beyond the scope of the noninfringing use defined by the statute

because we have never before had the opportunity to address the scope of section 272 we outline briefly the statutes history and the interpretive resources at our disposal
we then proceed to address in turn each of the provisions identified by the district_court

a
although section 272 was enacted as part of the 1952 revision of the patent_laws its legislative_history is brief noting only that section 272 was drafted to codify the supreme_courts holding in brown v. duchesne 60 u.s. 19 how
183 15_l.ed._595_(1856) and to satisfy the obligations of the united_states under the paris_convention for the protection of industrial_property` paris_convention'
see h.r.rep
no._82-1923 at 10 1952` section 272 is a new section in the law relating to infringement but it is of relatively little importance and it follows a paragraph in a treaty to which the united_states is a party
`` ; s.rep
no._82-1979 at 28 1952` this section follows the requirement [ in article_5ter ] of the international convention for the protection of industrial_property to which the united_states is a party and also codifies the holding of the supreme_court [ in brown ] that use of a patented_invention on board a foreign ship does not infringe a patent
``

in the middle of the nineteenth century nearly a century before the enactment of section 272 the supreme_court in brown held that the owner of a patent on an invention related to the rigging of a sailing ship had no cause of action against the master of a french_schooner that voyaged between boston and a colony of france and that embodied the invention
see 60 u.s. 19 how at 193
given` that the improvement in question was placed on [ the ship ] in a foreign_port.. and was authorized by the laws of the country to which she belonged' the question presented was [ w ] hether any improvement in the construction or equipment of a foreign vessel for which a patent has been obtained in the united_states can be used by such_vessel within the jurisdiction of the united_states while she is temporarily there for the purposes of commerce without the consent of the patentee
id.at 194
eschewing a narrowly framed plain_meaning analysis of the patent_laws then on the books,6 the court held that an *1327 interpretation of a patent right so broad as to label the french vessels use of the invention as an infringing use

[ w ] ould confer on patentees not only the rights of property but also political power and enable them to embarrass the treaty-making power in its negotiations with foreign_nations and also to interfere with the legislation of congress when exercising its constitutional power to regulate commerce
id.at 197
thus because the court considered it unlikely that congress would have intended to delegate such broad authority to patentees the court construed the statutory rights of a patentee7 not to extend to [ t ] he use of [ a patented ] improvement in the construction fitting out or equipment of such_vessel while she is coming into or going out of a port of the united_states.. provided it was placed upon her in a foreign_port and authorized by the laws of the country to which she belongs
id.at 198-99
the holding in brown thus circumscribes the rights of a u.s. patent holder vis-a-vis the use of a patented_invention on foreign vessels present in the united_states
however other language in the opinion clearly demonstrates that the court did not intend to place all conduct on such_vessels outside the scope of a patentees rights if [ the invention ] had been manufactured on her deck while she was lying in the port of boston or if the captain had sold it there he would undoubtedly have trespassed upon the rights of the plaintiff and would have been justly answerable for the profit and advantage he thereby obtained
id.at 196
only the use of a patented_invention` in the construction fitting out or equipment of such_vessel [ s ]' was held to constitute a noninfringing use
id.at 198

the relevant section of article_5ter of the paris_convention reads as follows in any country of the union the following shall not be considered as infringements of the rights of a patentee.. 2. the use of devices forming the subject of the patent in the construction or operation of aircraft or land_vehicles of other countries of the union or of accessories of such aircraft or land_vehicles when those aircraft of land_vehicles temporarily or accidentally enter the said country.8

there are only two cases in which federal courts have applied section 272
in cali *1328 v. japan airlines inc. 380_f.supp._1120_(e.d.n.y.1974) affd 535_f.2d_1240_(2d_cir.1975) the eastern_district of new york held that the use of a patented_invention in the jet engines of planes belonging to international air carriers during` their flights to and from the united_states and their over-flights of the united_states in the course of the regular prosecution of their scheduled air services' was within the scope of the noninfringing uses specified in section 272
id.at 1122 1124
in hughes aircraft co. v. united_states 29 fed
cl
197 1993 the court of federal claims held that spacecraft brought into the united_states for launch into outer_space prior to 19819 were outside the scope of section 272
id.at 232` when a spacecraft is delivered to the united_states for the purpose of allowing the united_states to launch it the spacecraft is the cargo that is brought here for an essential use not avessel orvehicle which enters the united_states as a means of conveyance
``

b
first the district_court held that the invention of the ¡¬575_patent embodied in the gbrx 20003 was not used in a vehicle of a country other than the united_states
according to the district_court the train not the rail_car is the relevant vehicle to examine under section 272 and the nationality of the locomotive determines the nationality of the train
therefore because the accused rail_cars will be used in the united_states in trains powered by locomotives owned and operated by united_states_companies on the united_states side of the exchange_points the district_court held that cprs intended use of the gbrx 20003 was beyond the scope of section 272.10

although we recognize that in some instances there may be ambiguity between containers that are merely the cargo of a vessel or vehicle and vessels or vehicles that are themselves aggregated and transported in a collective fashion for greater efficiency we discern no such ambiguity here congress has defined` vehicle' with sufficient breadth to include an individual rail_car
in 1 u.s.c.¡± 4 a provision of the dictionary_act congress has provided that` [ t ] he wordvehicle includes every description of carriage or other artificial contrivance used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on land'
the ordinary meaning of` carriage' in turn is defined to encompass` means of conveyance'` a wheeled vehicle for people' or` a wheeled support carrying a burden' such as` a gun carriage'
websters third_new_international_dictionary 343 1993
this definition controls our interpretation of` vehicle' in section 272 cf
united_states v. reid 206_f.supp.2d_132 138 d.mass.2002 looking to the dictionary_act to define` vehicle' as the term is used in the usa patriot act of 2001 ; p.j
federico` commentary on the new patent act' 35_u.s.c.a._1 54 west 1954 stating that the definition of vehicle provided in 1 u.s.c.¡± 4 would apply to section 272 and leads us to define a rail_car individually-not only the train as a whole-as a vehicle within the meaning of section 272
we therefore conclude that a depressed_center-beam_flat_car owned by cpr may be a foreign vehicle and therefore *1329 is not disqualified from the noninfringing status created by section 272 on this basis

c. the next question presented is also a legal question involving statutory_interpretation when is a vehicle only` entering the united_states temporarily' under section 272 ?
the district_court held that the accused rail_car will not be` temporarily' present in the united_states as required by section 272 because it` will spend the majority of its time delivering lumber to united_states destinations' and because cpr` will derive significant benefits from using the accused rail_car in the united_states'
the district_court thus determined that the appropriate statutory metric by which to measure whether a vehicle is entering` temporarily' should be either the duration of the vehicles stay in the united_states in relation to the duration of its stay elsewhere or the benefit of which the patent owner is deprived by virtue of the exception to patent_rights created by section 272
we decline to adopt either metric and instead define a vehicle entering the united_states` temporarily' as a vehicle entering the united_states for a limited_period of time for the sole_purpose of engaging in international_commerce

we begin by noting that the statutory_language is ambiguous rather than clear and unambiguous insofar as it limits entries to those occurring` temporarily'
see clary v. united_states 333_f.3d_1345 1348 fed.cir.2003` we must firstdetermine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case
`` quoting robinson v. shell oil co. 519_u.s._337 340 117_s.ct._843 136_l.ed.2d_808_(1997)
according to the words plain_meaning entering` temporarily' is entering either` for a brief_period' or` during a limited_time'
websters third_new_international_dictionary 2353 1993
not only however is the term` temporarily' ambiguous in the sense that it can be understood in different manners neither of its meanings alone leads to a permissible self-sufficient interpretation
on the one hand the concept of entry for a` brief_period' does not provide sufficient content by which to draw a reasonable or steady line brief is only a relative concept and must be measured in relation to something but the plain statutory_language considered in isolation does not provide sufficient context to determine the appropriate meaning of brief
in other_words` brief' is itself indeterminate
on the other hand the idea of an entering for a` limited_time' provides a rule that is determinable but that seems to lead to absurdly broad results if applied literally without any further qualifications
limited means nothing more than` restricted in..
duration'
id.at 1312
entry is literally limited provided only that it is not permanent
an interpretation of section 272 that only required a limited entry in this literal sense-that only required a vehicle to exit the united_states at some point before the end of its useful life-and nothing more would create a loophole in a patentees rights too large to be a rational interpretation of congress intent
see pitsker v. office of pers
mgmt. 234_f.3d_1378 1383 fed.cir.2000 invoking` the canon of statutory construction that an interpretation that causes absurd results is to be avoided if at all possible' citing haggar co. v. helvering 308_u.s._389 394 60_s.ct._337 84_l.ed._340_(1940)

confronted with an ambiguous statute we turn to the legislative_history to discern congress intent in defining` temporarily' see clary 333 f.3d at 1348 noting that the courts look` to the legislative_history if the statutory_language is unclear' which in turn directs us to brown and the paris_convention
in addition to the requirement that entry be for only a limited_period *1330 of time both of these sources suggest that` temporarily' should be interpreted in light of a vehicles purpose to participate in international_commerce at the time of entry-namely a purpose to enter the united_states engage in international_commerce and then depart

brown emphasized that a construction of the patent_laws under which a united_states patentee could bring infringement_suits against the use of an invention on vessels such as the french_schooner at issue was undesirable because it` would.. seriously embarrass the commerce of the country with foreign_nations'
brown 60 u.s. 19 how at 197
the court also noted that the vessels interference with the rights of the patentee was minimal precisely because the schooner entered the united_states only to use the port of boston and departed from the jurisdiction of the united_states after its commercial transaction was completed
see id.at 196` [ t ] he only use made of [ the invention ] which can be supposed to interfere with the rights of the plaintiff was in navigating the vessel into and out of the harbor when she arrived or was about to depart and while she was within the jurisdiction of the united_states`
in sum the court held that the use of a patented_invention in a vessel within the jurisdiction of the united_states that was limited to the bare essentials of the contact with the united_states required to engage in international_commerce was beyond the scope of the patentees exclusive_rights

although the statutory_interpretation in brown involved a unilateral act on the part of the united_states both article_5ter of the paris_convention and section 272 demonstrate the centrality of international_commerce in the statutory scheme through their provisions requiring reciprocal treatment for means of transport owned by united_states_companies that are` temporarily' present in foreign_countries

both brown and article_5ter of the paris_convention demonstrate a concern to leave the channels of international_commerce or more accurately the vessels and vehicles that pass through these channels free from the excessive burdens that would result if such_vessels or vehicles had to conform to the patent_laws of all nations that the vessel or vehicle visited during its lifetime
different inventions are likely to be patented in different_countries and the same invention may be owned by different parties in different_countries
in section 272 congress intended to join an international movement to place foreign-owned means of international transport beyond the reach of domestic patentees exclusive_rights because the cost of complying with multiple inconsistent rights of exclusion provided by the patent regimes of a large number of countries would likely place an excessive drag on international_commerce

although their opinions are not binding on us it is interesting to note that other courts considering similar issues have suggested the very definition of` temporary' that we adopt today
for example the court in cali concluded that entering the united_states` temporarily' should be defined in relation to the vehicle's-or in the case of cali the aircraft's-involvement in international as opposed to domestic commerce
in cali the court noted that` it is undeniable [ ] that.. defendants are major transoceanic carriers and that their passenger and freight services to the united_states and over the united_states are regular of very considerable extent long continued and supported by ground service marketing facilities etc'
380 f.supp.at 1122
nonetheless the court held that section 272 provided a full defense to a patent_infringement suit for the use of the patented_invention because` temporarily' was defined in relation to the` international_trade' that section 272 *1331 was intended to protect not in relation to the duration of the entry it is difficult to see any other purpose in section 272 and article_5ter than to meet the needs and realities of international_trade and navigation
`` temporarily' then could not sensibly mean any less than entering for the purpose of completing a voyage turning about and continuing or commencing a new voyage
the distinction would be between a caravelle manufactured in france and powered with such an [ allegedly infringing ] engine delivered here for use by an airline in this country for domestic traffic even though manufactured and sold in france and a foreign aircraft arriving here on an international flight only to unload turn about reload and depart
id.at 1126

in conclusion we hold that the definition of entering` temporarily' as the word is used in section 272 is entering for a period of time of finite duration with the sole_purpose of engaging in international_commerce
in light of our interpretation of section 272 we reject both prongs of the district_courts reasoning explaining why the accused rail_cars would not be entering the united_states` temporarily'
the expectation that cprs drop-deck_center-beam_flat_cars will spend more than 50 percent of their useful lifespan in the united_states is not relevant to the section 272 analysis
if the cars are entering the united_states for a limited_time-that is they are not entering permanently-and are entering only for the purpose of engaging in international_commerce-that is they are entering to unload foreign goods and/or to load domestic goods destined for foreign markets-they are entering` temporarily' for the purposes of section 272 regardless of the length of their stay within the jurisdiction of the united_states

furthermore neither the magnitude of the benefit derived by cpr from use of the cars nor the burden imposed on nsc from the carve-out of cprs use from the scope of its right to exclude under the ¡¬575_patent is relevant to the section 272 analysis
we agree with the reasoning that the court in cali put forward to address the patentees argument that [ t ] he particular airlines involved given the magnitude of their carrier operations between foreign_countries and this country are such that the airlines are comparable to american airlines in the extent of their use of the article of calis patent and that in consequence the subtraction from the grant to cali of the right to exclude others from the use of his patent is a very great subtraction and one hardly tolerable under the statutory and treaty language which might be thought to deal only with relatively unimportant` temporary' and` accidental' invasions of the patent right that are without commercial significance
that subtraction although large appears nevertheless plainly to be what the statutory and treaty_immunities intend..11

id.at 1127

therefore we hold that nsc has not demonstrated that cprs section 272 defense lacks` substantial_merit' because the entering` temporarily' condition is not satisfied.12 nsc does however advance *1332 one argument that although not considered by the district_court raises a question regarding whether cpr will succeed on the merits of the section 272 noninfringement defense
at the preliminary_injunction hearing mr._buggs the general manager of car management with cpr testified that` sometimes.. the u.s. [ r ] ailway will grab one of our [ center-beam flat ] cars with [ out ] 13 our permission.. [ a ] nd.. they will move it you know load it to another point'
because cpr acknowledged that its newly acquired drop-deck_center-beam_flat_cars will be used in the same fashion that its current_fleet of center-beam_flat_cars is used nsc uses the testimony of mr._buggs to allege that the gbrx 20003 cars enter the united_states in part with a purpose to engage in domestic rather than international commerce
certainly the unforeseen` grabbing' of one of cprs large fleet of cars without cprs permission can not lead to a reasonable inference that cpr had a purpose to engage in commerce other than international_commerce
however if cpr regularly condones such repeated` grabbing' of its cars for domestic_commerce and cpr receives remuneration for the` grabbing' that is substantial in relation to the income that the cars produce through their use in international_commerce,14 a factfinder could infer that cprs intent is not to engage in essentially international_commerce
based on the current record however we hold that nscs allegations do not deprive cprs section 272 defense of substantial_merit

d. third the district_court held that the drop-deck_center-beam rail_car invention was not` used exclusively for the needs of the.. vehicle' as section 272 requires
framing section 272 narrowly around the holdings of brown cali and hughes the district_court concluded that for an invention to be` used exclusively for the needs of the.. vehicle' it must` help propel the trains help in positioning the trains or help in [ some ] other way to make the trains work'
because the invention of the ¡¬575_patent defines the structure of the rail_car rather than an aspect of the locomotives propulsion system the district_court concluded that the use of invention in the ¡¬575_patent in the accused rail_car did not fall within the scope of section 272

we disagree that the` exclusively for the needs of the.. vehicle' language in section 272 should be interpreted so narrowly as to exclude inventions such as the ¡¬575_patent pertaining to the construction of a vehicle
the district_court erroneously overlaid the concept of` propulsive needs' onto the statute ;` structural needs' are *1333 also encompassed within the plain_meaning of the statute

this reading of section 272 is consistent with brown and the paris_convention the sources of law to which congress referred in enacting section 272
in brown the supreme_court characterized its own holding of noninfringement more broadly to pertain to inventions` used in the construction fitting out or equipment' of a vessel
60 u.s. 19 how at 198 emphasis added
likewise the paris_convention extends the scope of noninfringing uses to inventions used` in the construction or operation of.. land_vehicles.. or of accessories of such.. land_vehicles'
paris_convention for the protection of industrial_property 21 u.s.t.at 1639 emphasis added
the text of the paris_convention expressly applies to inventions used in either the construction or the operation of a vehicle whereas the district_court limited the meaning of the` exclusively for the needs of the.. vehicle' language in section 272 to only the latter.15 cf fed.-mogul corp. v. united_states 63_f.3d_1572 1581 fed.cir.1995` absent express congressional language to the contrary statutes should not be interpreted to conflict with international obligations
``

e. fourth and finally the district_court held that the use of the invention in the ¡¬575_patent in the gbrx 20003 did not qualify as a noninfringing use under section 272 because the language of section 272 requires that the invention not be` offered for sale or sold in.. the united_states'
the district_court found that greenbrier had` offered the accused rail_car for sale to at least three different companies in the united_states' and that` cpr itself may sell the accused rail_cars to leasing companies in the united_states'
we conclude that neither line of reasoning is sufficient to uphold the district_courts preliminary_injunction against canadian_pacific

first insofar as it relied on sales by greenbrier who is not a party to this suit of rail_cars in which cpr never had any financial interest the district_court erred in its construction of the statute
the` offered for sale or sold in.. the united_states' provision of section 272 does not apply to sales made by third parties of embodiments of the invention other than those that temporarily enter the united_states

again the language of brown is instructive to interpret the meaning of the` offered for sale or sold in.. the united_states' language in section 272
in brown the court noted that the captain would be liable under the patent_laws` if the captain had sold [ the invention ] there' namely in the port of boston
60 u.s. 19 how at 196
this concept-the prohibition on selling the very embodiment of the invention that had been used in the vessel or vehicle while the vehicle was temporarily or accidentally in the united_states-has been codified in the language of section 272 that permits the statutes application only` if the invention.. is not offered for sale or sold in.. the united_states'
35 u.s.c.¡± 272

second insofar as it relied on its finding of fact that canadian_pacific` may sell the accused rail_cars to leasing companies in the united_states' we conclude that the district_courts discretion involved *1334 a clear_error of judgment
see oakley 316 f.3d at 1339 ; amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350

we accept the district_courts finding of fact that cpr` may' seek to finance its purchase of the fleet of gbrx 20003 rail_cars through a sale-leaseback_arrangement in which cpr would sell the cars to a united_states leasing company and then lease the cars back through a capital or operating lease
as the district_court itself found` [ n ] o decision has been made about the ownership_structure of the dropped deck_center_beam_flat_cars' to be operated by cpr
furthermore we agree with the district_courts implicit conclusion that a sale-leaseback_arrangement between cpr and a u.s. company would even at this preliminary-injunction_phase remove substantial_merit from cprs defense of noninfringement based on section 272
not only might the sale-leaseback_arrangement constitute a sale of` the invention' as prohibited by the language in the second half of section 272 it also might transform the rail_car into a vehicle of the united_states and thus remove the use of the invention from the scope of the uses provided for in the first half of section 272

however a finding that cpr` may' engage in such conduct is alone insufficient to deprive cprs section 272 defense of substantial_merit
if at some point in the future nsc can show that a decision on ownership has been reached and that the chosen ownership_structure would deprive cprs section 272 defense of substantial_merit nsc may request appropriate relief at that time

f. in conclusion upon considered review of the each element of the district_courts reasoning we hold that the district_court abused its discretion in holding that canadian_pacifics section 272 defense lacked substantial_merit

vi
we now turn to cprs defenses based on the alleged invalidity of the ¡¬575_patent
a validity analysis must be conducted on a claim-by-claim basis
see amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1351 ; ortho pharm corp. v. smith 959_f.2d_936 942 fed.cir.1992
`` it is elementary in patent law that in determining whether a patent is valid.. the first step is to determine the meaning and scope of each claim in suit'
amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1351 quoting lemelson v. gen. mills inc. 968_f.2d_1202 1206 fed.cir.1992
after construing the claims a court must compare the prior_art to claims as one of ordinary_skill of art at the time of the invention would have done
although` the ultimate determination of whether the claims at issue would have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a legal conclusion that [ we ] review de novo' this legal determination is to be made on the basis of the following underlying findings of fact` 1 the scope and content of the prior_art ; 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claims ; 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and 4 objective evidence of nonobviousness'
riverwood_int l corp. v. mead corp. 212_f.3d_1365 1366 fed.cir.2000

although these principles of claim-by-claim analysis and of construction-before-comparison-to-prior-art apply in the context of a preliminary_injunction as well as at trial the accused infringers burden of proof is notably different in the two contexts
at the preliminary-injunction_phase once the accused infringer has posed a substantial_question of invalidity the patentee must demonstrate that the invalidity_defense lacks substantial_merit
see oakley 316 f.3d at 1339-40` [ t ] he [ preliminary ] injunction should not issue if the party opposing the injunction raises a substantial_question concerning infringement *1335 or validity meaning that it asserts a defense that [ the party seeking the injunction ] can not prove lacks substantial_merit
`` quoting tate access floors inc. v. interface architectural res. inc. 279_f.3d_1357 1365 fed.cir.2002 second alteration in original
in other_words` [ v ] ulnerability is the issue at the preliminary_injunction stage while validity is the issue at trial
the showing of a substantial_question as to invalidity thus requires less proof than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself' at trial
amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1359

we hold that the district_court erred in its conclusion that nsc demonstrated that cprs obviousness defense lacked substantial_merit
we emphasize however that our conclusion is based only on the preliminary record and the district_courts findings of fact and does not represent a final resolution of the obviousness_issue
see id.at 1360
whether cpr can present clear and convincing evidence of the invalidity of the ¡¬575_patent during a trial on the merits or whether nsc will show that some aspect of the claims would have been nonobvious remains to be determined

a
without holding a markman hearing the district_court preliminarily construed only five limitations in the ¡¬575_patent` flat_car'` bulkhead'` center_beam'` floor' and` side_sill_transition means'
it did not construe any other terms because it considered these terms to provide a dispositive showing that cprs invalidity_defenses lacked substantial_merit
because our aim is to determine if the district_court correctly concluded that cprs challenges to the validity of the ¡¬575 lack substantial_merit not to provide a definitive construction of all of the claim_terms that might be relevant at trial we find it unnecessary to review the district_courts claim construction at this point
in other_words we reach our conclusion that cpr has demonstrated that the ¡¬575_patent is subject to a substantial obviousness challenge under the district_courts preliminary claim construction

b
first we must examine the content of the prior_art to see if it discloses the limitations in the ¡¬575_patent construed by the district_court
the content of prior_art presents an issue of fact that this court reviews only for clear_error
riverwood_int l 212 f.3d at 1366
although cpr made obviousness arguments below based on several combinations of a group of prior_art_references its primary contention on appeal is that the ¡¬575_patent is obvious in light of only two of them u.s. patent no._3734,031` wagner' and u.s. patent no._2996,020` udstad'16

wagner discloses a` flat_car'
wagner col.1 ll
4-5` [ t ] his invention is concerned with an improved railroad_car related to the flat-bed type`
the district_courts own_findings of fact demonstrate that wagner also contains three more of the relevant limitations considered by the district_court [ the wagner ] patent was for a center_beam railroad_car
the patent covered a car with a lightweight center_sill and side_sills crossbearers supporting the floor and a vertical center_beam joined at its bottom to the center_sill and extending longitudinally the length of the car between the bulkheads at each end of the car.17

( emphases added
we see no error here

*1336 the limitations of the ¡¬575_patent that are not present in wagner are those related to the depressed_center or drop-deck
the claims of the ¡¬ 575 patent encompass a car with higher floor sections on the ends and a flat lower section in between
see ¡¬575_patent col 5 ll
64-68` said floor means having end_floor_sections lying in a first generally horizontal_plane for respectively supporting said end_floor_sections and an intermediate_depressed_floor_section disposed in a second generally horizontal_plane lying below said first_horizontal_plane'
to achieve this difference in elevation the ¡¬575_patent also claims a pair of` side_sill_assemblies' running along the outside edges of the floor on both sides of the railcar that are higher next to the higher end_floor_sections and lower next to the lower floor section in the middle
see id. col 6 ll
3-8` each of said side_sill_assemblies includes a pair of upper_end_sections extending along an upper_axis and an intermediate_section extending along a lower_axis disposed below said first_axis for supporting said intermediate_depressed_floor_section'
claim 5 adds the limitation of a` side_sill_transition means for joining said end_sections of each of said side_sill_assemblies to said intermediate_section'
see id. col 6 ll
47-49

udstad teaches these limitations related to the depressed_center which were not present in wagner
udstad` relates to railway_cars for transporting automobile bodies or other large or heavy equipment and more particularly to such a car where lading bearing sides are removable and can be utilized as automobile body skids or lading pallets during loading and unloading operations'
udstad col._1,_ll._9-14
in a preferred_embodiment udstad teaches a railroad_car carrying automobiles suspended on the inside surface of its outer walls
in udstad the bottom of the railroad_car between the end_truck_assemblies is lower than the portion over the end_truck_assemblies because the cars can fit vertically into the railroad_car only if this additional space between is utilized
to achieve this lowered center_portion udstad teaches a side_sill assembly that is also higher on the ends and lower in the center
id. col._2,_ll._6-10 20-22` in the end zones of the car.. [ there are ] side_sills [ ] which are normally disposed above the uppermost plane of the truck wheels..
in the central zone of the car between the trucks.. [ there are ] lowered side_sills..'
additionally udstad teaches a side_sill_transition means
id. col 3 ll
17-21` gussets [ ] reinforce the corner connection of the inner ends of the normally disposed side_sills and the side posts [ ] which extend downwardly to their connection with the lowered side_sills
``18

nsc argues that udstad does not teach the` intermediate_depressed_floor_section' of claim 1 because udstads floor was not load-bearing and was not therefore a floor at all in light of the district_courts construction of the term.19 we *1337 however do not look to udstad to find the floor
wagner provides this element
we look to udstad only to suggest depressing the bottom of the center_portion of the car.20

thus we conclude that cpr has made a strong case that all elements of the ¡¬ 575 patent are present in wagner and udstad and that nsc has not overcome that case
again however we emphasize that our conclusion reaches only to an assessment of the strength of cprs case on the record before us not to a final adjudication on the merits

c. even if all its limitations could be found in the total set of elements contained in the prior_art_references a claimed invention would not be obvious without a demonstration of the existence of a motivation to combine those references at the time of the invention
see ecolochem inc. v. s. cal
edison co. 227_f.3d_1361 1371 fed.cir.2000
this requirement prevents a court from labeling as obvious in hindsight a solution that was not obvious to one of ordinary_skill at the time of the invention
see id

the district_court held that` [ a ] t the time the ¡¬575_patent was invented there was no suggestion teaching or motivation to combine udstad with wagner'
we disagree
cpr relied primarily on two sources pre-dating the application for the ¡¬575_patent to demonstrate the requisite motivation to combine the` lund_drawing' and the` prichard_disclosure'
although the district_court discussed both the district_courts focus seems to have centered on whether either had been disseminated to a sufficiently broad public so as to give either the status of a prior_art_reference.21 yet the prior-art status of the prichard_disclosure and the lund_drawing is not dispositive
it has long been the law that the motivation to combine need not be found in prior_art_references but equally can be found` in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary_skill in the art'
in re jones 958_f.2d_347 351 fed.cir.1992 citing in re fine 837_f.2d_1071 1074 fed.cir.1988
the motivation to combine can be located either in a prior_art_reference or it can be implicit in the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art
see in re huston 308_f.3d_1267 1280 fed.cir.2002 ; motorola inc. v. interdigital tech corp. 121_f.3d_1461 1472 fed.cir.1997
we conclude that both the prichard_disclosure and the lund_drawing can be understood to suggest that one of ordinary_skill in the *1338 art would have been motivated to combine wagner and udstad

1
in its findings of fact the district_court described the lund_drawing as follows in 1986 gunderson [ a manufacturer of rail_cars ] was trying to build a flat_car with a center_partition to haul lumber
when the flat_car gunderson was making at the time was loaded the car reached capacity in terms of the volume of the load before reaching capacity in terms of the weight of the load.. john michael lund was an engineer in the area of freight_car_design at gunderson during the mid-1980s
on august 1 1986 he prepared a drawing of a flat_car with a center_partition having a depressed_floor
the drawing was titled` 100 ton center beam bulkhead with dropped side sills'
the district_court held that` [ t ] he lund_drawing [ ] is not information related to the prior_art because it was not within the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art' supporting its conclusion with the observations that` mr._lund did not have an engineering or rail_car design background and.. he never discussed with any engineers or rail_car designers whether the car in his drawing could be built'
in sum the district_court concluded that` his drawing is not relevant to what would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art' at the time of the invention

this is clear_error
first mr._lunds background does not disqualify his drawing from being relevant to whether a motivation to combine was implicit in the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art
mr._lund testified that he possessed an associates degree in mechanical engineering and he had several years experience in rail_car engineering at the time he made his drawing
it is true that the length of his professional service may not have risen to the level that the court used to define one of ordinary_skill in the art the court determined that` the hypothetical person of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the ¡¬575_patent would have a college degree in engineering or design and approximately five to ten years of experience in designing rail_cars'
( emphasis added
however especially in light of the district_courts finding that he was working as` an engineer in the area of freight_car_design' lunds knowledge is relevant to determining the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill of the art even if lunds qualifications fell short of the background required of one of ordinary_skill
something that has already been rendered obvious to a relative newcomer in a field is probative of what would be obvious to someone who has been around for a longer period of time
cf
in re agger 45_c.c.p.a._734 249_f.2d_895 897 1957 noting that the` claimed subject matter would have been obvious to a person even having less thanordinary skill in the relevant_art'

second the district_court erred as a matter of law insofar as it held that mr._lunds failure to share this drawing with others disqualifies the lund_drawing from being relevant to whether a motivation to combine wagner and udstad is implicit in the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art
the question at hand is not whether others learned of the lund_drawing as it would be if we were determining the status of the prichard_disclosure as prior_art
rather we are concerned only with whether the lund_drawing demonstrates that others in mr._lunds position or a more experienced position would have considered it obvious to combine the elements found in wagner and udstad
public distribution is irrelevant to this latter concern

*1339 2
in its findings of fact the district_court described the prichard_disclosure as follows john prichard was an assistant market manager for lumber at union_pacific.. a large railroad company..
in march 1987 mr._prichard spoke with people at gunderson about his idea for combining a center_partition car with a depressed well car in order to explore the possibility of having gunderson build the car for union_pacific
one of the people at gunderson with whom mr._prichard spoke was william galbraith
in addition to gunderson mr._pritchard spoke about his idea for a center_beam car with a depressed_floor with people at weyerhauser boise cascade louisiana pacific georgia pacific and potlatch.. mr. galbraith prepared a memorandum for bruce ward president of gunderson concerning the center_partition dropped floor car design.. bob woolston a senior design engineer with gunderson was asked to prepare drawings and calculations related to a dropped deck_center_beam rail_car designed to carry lumber.. gunderson never made a car like the one in mr._pritchards drawings for union_pacific

whether or not the prichard_disclosure is a prior_art_reference it is evidence that can be used to demonstrate a motivation to combine implicit in the knowledge of one of skill in the art of rail_car design
like lund prichard is one of less than ordinary_skill in the art employed within the relevant_art
thus like lunds testimony prichards testimony is relevant to determining what was implicit in the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art.22

3
additionally the district_court concluded that both udstad and wagner` teach away' from the invention in the ¡¬575_patent
if a reference brings up the topic of combining two references but then states that the combination` would produce a seemingly inoperative device' then the reference teaches away from the combination
see tec air inc. v. denso mfg
mich. inc. 192_f.3d_1353 1360 fed.cir.1999 quoting in re sponnoble 56_c.c.p.a._823 405_f.2d_578 587 1969

the district_court determined that udstad and wagner taught away from the invention of the ¡¬575_patent because the goals of the inventions in udstad and wagner were not the same as the goal of the invention in the ¡¬575_patent
a finding that two inventions were designed to resolve different problems however is insufficient to demonstrate that one invention teaches away from another
see baxter int l inc. v. mcgaw inc. 149_f.3d_1321 1328 fed.cir.1998 quoting in re gurley 27_f.3d_551 553 fed.cir.1994 noting that` a reference will teach away if it suggests that the line of development flowing from the references disclosure is unlikely to be productive of the result sought'

4
finally the district_court noted that the` secondary conditions' discussed by the *1340 supreme_court in graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) and in united_states v. adams 383_u.s._39 52 86_s.ct._708 15_l.ed.2d_572_(1966) advocated in favor of a finding of nonobviousness
two of the factors the district_court found persuasive were the failure of others to invent the drop-deck_center-beam_flat_car earlier and a long-felt need for the invention
based on the district_courts own_findings we hold that the district_court abused its discretion in considering these factors to be factors that undermine the ¡¬575_patents obviousness
the district_court expressly found that the design for a railway_car resulting from the prichard_disclosure was not pursued because of a lack of demonstrated customer interest the district_court found that` union_pacifics customers were satisfied' with the cars that gunderson was at the time already making
this finding of no customer demand is flatly contradictory with its conclusion that a long-felt need existed and suggests that prior lack of interest in the prichard_disclosure was not because prichard failed to conceive the invention in the ¡¬575_patent
the remaining secondary considerations considered by the district_court are insufficient by themselves to uphold the district_courts conclusion on the obviousness_issue

vii
in conclusion we hold that the district_court abused its discretion in determining that nsc had demonstrated that cprs defenses lacked substantial_merit and in granting the preliminary_injunction
based on the record before us both cprs section 272 argument and its argument concerning the invalidity of the ¡¬575_patent on the basis of obviousness raise defenses with substantial_merit

although the court decided the case on the basis of statutory_interpretation it further questioned whether an individuals ability to exercise patent_rights in such a situation would amount to an impermissible delegation of congress treaty power and its power to regulate international_commerce id.at 198 or whether congress itself could constitutionally regulate international_commerce through a statute passed under the auspices of the patent and copyright clause which granted a power that was` domestic in its character' id.at 195

nsc points to an analysis that it performed based on documents obtained through discovery on which the district_court seems not to have commented indicating that cpr derived over one and a half million dollars per year in` car hire' payments from united_states railroad companies during each of the years from 2000_to_2002
however there is no indication that these payments came from payments made by united_states_companies engaged in domestic_commerce or that such payments are distinct from payments for the international shipment of lumber by cpr from canada to particular destinations in the united_states after those shipments pass the exchange_points
15
furthermore the ¡¬575_patent itself describes the invention in question as an invention related to the stability-and thus the propulsion-of the train
see ¡¬575_patent col._2,_ll._46-49` the reduced center of gravity.. significantly improves the track worthiness and ride stability of the car`
16
cpr also argues that the ¡¬575_patent is anticipated by udstad
we do not reach this argument
17
wagner also discloses the` u-shaped cross sectional configuration' of the side_sill_assemblies that is claimed as a limitation in claim 23 of the ¡¬575_patent
18
whether this structure is the` equivalent' of the structure corresponding to the side_sill_transition means as is required for an infringement or invalidity analysis under ¡± 112 ?
6 has not been addressed by the district_court and will remain unresolved until a trial on the merits
claims 6_and_7 recite further structure for the side_sill_transition means
neither the district_court nor nsc has addressed the added limitations in these claims
19
the district_court concluded that a` floor' is` the layer of material which is placed on top of the underframe of a car and provides the direct_support for the car_contents'
we note in passing that the district_courts inclusion of a functional limitation in the definition of a floor-requiring a floor to` provide [ ] the direct_support for the car_contents' -is not only unusual in a structural patent see schwing gmbh v. putzmeister aktiengesellschaft 305_f.3d_1318 1324 fed.cir.2002 indicating that functional limitations are usually not placed on claim_terms that denote structure but also may cause the claimed invention not to read on the preferred_embodiment in the specification of the ¡¬575_patent
figures 7_and_8 of the ¡¬575_patent illustrate that the load rests directly on` tapered_pieces' that` are tapered downward from the side_sill_assemblies [ ] toward the center of the depressed_center_beam_flat_car'
¡¬575_patent col._4,_ll._56-59
nscs expert testified that if the` floor' receives any weight it does so only indirectly through the` tapered_pieces'
claim interpretations that do not read on the preferred_embodiment are` rarely if ever correct and would require highly persuasive evidentiary support'
vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1583 fed.cir.1996
20
nsc argues that neither udstad nor wagner teaches how to design the structure of a depressed load-bearing center floor
nsc may argue this point at trial but it cites no evidence to suggest that it was not within the ability of one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention
furthermore according to the district_courts own_findings one witness suggested that there is an entire` specialty fleet of depressed_center flat_cars being used to move large bulky or tall items through the railroad system'
21
we do not reach cprs argument on appeal that the prichard_disclosure is a prior_art_reference because prichards verbal disclosure of his idea made it` known.. by others in this country' as required by 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a
22
it is true that the district_court found that` mr._pritchard did not have an engineering degree or any technical or engineering training
he did not have experience designing rail_cars'
however if all of the technical elements of an invention are present in different references in the prior_art the motivation to combine can be provided by a marketer rather than an engineer of the very art in question
here the motivation to combine derives from the needs of the lumber-shipping customers and the marketing department of a company operating a railroad is a logical genesis of an innovative motivation to combine in the field of railroad_car design
