leapfrog_enterprises inc.` leapfrog' appeals from the order of the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware entering judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of claim 25 of leapfrogs u.s._patent 5,813,861` the ¡¬861_patent` in favor of fisher-price inc. and mattel inc. collectively` fisher-price'
we affirm

background
leapfrog filed suit in october 2003 alleging that fisher-prices powertouch product infringed claim 25 of the ¡¬861_patent
leapfrog amended the complaint to add mattel inc. as a codefendant in september 2004
the ¡¬861_patent relates to a learning device to help young children read phonetically
claim 25 reads as follows

an interactive learning device comprising a housing including a plurality of switches ; a sound_production_device in communication with the switches and including a processor and a memory ; at least one depiction of a sequence of letters each letter being associable with a switch ; and
a reader configured to communicate the identity of the depiction to the processor wherein selection of a depicted letter activates an associated switch to communicate with the processor causing the sound_production_device to generate a signal corresponding to a sound associated with the selected letter the sound being determined by a position of the letter in the sequence of letters
¡¬861_patent col. 10 ll.23-36

in an april_7,_2005 order the trial_court construed a number of terms from claim 25 of the patent
the court construed the phrase` selection of a depicted letter' to mean` choosing a particular depicted letter from the depicted sequence of letters by contacting or coming into proximity to that particular depicted letter'
leapfrog enters. inc. v. fisher-price inc. no._03-927 d.del
apr._7,_2005

the accused powertouch_device consists of a hinged_plastic_housing containing electronics and a speaker that opens to lie flat
when so opened a user places a book made for use with the device in a rectangular recess in the housing
the books contain large colorful pictures that also show words associated with the objects shown in those pictures
the user may select one of multiple modes of operation
in phonics_mode when the user touches one of the words on the page the device pronounces the word then pronounces each phoneme of the word in sequence and finally pronounces the entire word again
the device relies on a grid of` crosspoints' located in the area underneath where the books are placed to detect the location on the page being touched by the user
the processor in the device may be programmed to associate a particular *1159 response with each crosspoint
some of the words on the pages of the books are large enough that each letter of the word corresponds to a separate_crosspoint
however the phonics_mode operates in the same manner for those words with pronunciation of the word the phonemes and the word again regardless which letter the user touches because each letter has been associated with the same response in the devices programming

the case proceeded to trial but the jury deadlocked on may_27,_2005
the parties stipulated that the case would be submitted to the trial_court for decision based on the record and the rulings made by the court at the time the case was submitted to the jury

the trial_court issued its decision on march_30,_2006 finding claim 25 of the ¡¬861_patent not infringed and invalid as obvious
the court found that the accused powertouch_device could not practice the` selection of a depicted letter' because it only allowed selection of words rather than letters
the court thus found that the powertouch did not infringe claim 25
the court also concluded that claim 25 was invalid as obvious in view of the combination of u.s._patent 3,748,748 to bevan the texas instruments super speak & read` ssr' device and the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art as represented by the testimony of fisher-prices technical expert ronald milner

leapfrog timely appealed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
a. noninfringement
the district_courts determination of infringement is a question of fact that we review for clear_error
abraxis bioscience inc. v. mayne pharm
( usa inc. 467_f.3d_1370 1375 fed.cir.2006
`` under the clear_error standard the courts findings will not be overturned in the absence of a definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been made'
impax labs. inc. v. aventis pharm inc. 468_f.3d_1366 1375 fed.cir.2006 quotation omitted

on appeal leapfrog does not challenge the district_courts construction of the phrase` selection of a depicted letter' but argues that the court clearly erred in applying that construction to the facts of the case
more specifically leapfrog argues that the powertouch does allow` choosing a particular depicted letter' because in at least some cases each letter of a word corresponds to a separate_crosspoint
thus the fact that the response of the device is the same no matter which letter the user touches is irrelevant because the user may still choose particular letters

fisher-price also does not challenge the district_courts claim construction and fisher-price responds that the district_court correctly determined that selection by choosing a particular letter is only meaningful if making one letter choice results in an outcome different from making a different letter choice
fisher-price argues that the district_court correctly found that only the word can be selected if the choice of letter within a particular word is irrelevant to the response of the device

we find no clear_error in the district_courts application of the claim to the essentially undisputed facts of this case
the courts conclusion that the fisher-price powertouch only allows selection of a word rather than` a depicted letter' comports with its construction of` selection' to mean` choosing'
the ordinary meaning of choice requires that the alternatives from which the choice is made will result in different possible outcomes
*1160 with the powertouch_device the same outcome results no matter which letter in the word the user touches
this understanding is also consistent with the way that selection of a depicted letter is described in the patent
every time the child depresses a letter key the book will recite the phoneme of the letter associated with that letter in the context that the letter is used in the word or phrase depicted on the card here` ball'
thus for the example where the subject is` ball' as shown if the child depresses the correct letter key of` b' the processor will sound the phoneme` b' as` b' is pronounced in` ball'
¡¬861_patent col.6 ll.17-23
most importantly this understanding of selection is also most consistent with the language of claim 25 itself
the powertouch_device does not generate a signal corresponding to a sound associated with the selected letter as the claim requires
a signal corresponding to a word is not the same as a signal corresponding to a letter
if the claim were meant to encompass a device that always enunciates all the letters of a word no matter which letter was selected the claim language requiring that` the sound be [ ] determined by a position of the letter in the sequence of letters' would be superfluous because no such determination would be necessary

leapfrog comes well short of supporting a definite and firm_conviction that a mistake has been made and we therefore affirm the district_courts entry of judgment of noninfringement in favor of fisher-price

b. obviousness
`` obviousness is a question of law reviewed de novo based upon underlying factual questions which are reviewed for clear_error following a bench trial'
alza corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 464_f.3d_1286 1289 fed.cir.2006 citing ruiz v. a.b
chance co. 357_f.3d_1270 1275 fed.cir.2004

leapfrog argues that the district_court engaged in improper hindsight in reaching its conclusion of obviousness by concluding that all of the limitations of the claim are found in the prior_art
leapfrog also argues that the courts finding that the bevan_device has the same_functionality as claim 25 was clearly erroneous because the components of bevans device are mechanical and thus different in structure and interrelation from the electronic_components described in claim 25 and therefore can not provide the same_functionality
leapfrog argues that there was inadequate evidence in the record to support a motivation to combine bevan the texas_instruments_ssr and a reader to arrive at the invention of claim 25
finally leapfrog argues that the district_court did not properly consider the strong evidence of secondary_considerations of nonobviousness

in response fisher-price argues that claim 25 is nothing more than the bevan_device a toy that teaches reading based on the association of letters with their phonemic sounds updated with modern_electronics that were common by the time of the alleged invention
fisher-price also responds that particularized and specific motivations to combine need not be found in the prior_art references themselves in the context of an improvement that arises from a desire to generally improve a known device e.g. to make the product smaller lighter or less expensive using newer_technology
finally fisher-price argues that the district_court did give proper_consideration to secondary_considerations of nonobviousness but simply concluded that those considerations were not sufficient to overcome the determination *1161 of obviousness based on primary considerations

we agree with fisher-price that the district_court correctly concluded that the subject matter of claim 25 of the ¡¬861_patent would have been obvious in view of the combination of bevan the ssr and the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art
an obviousness determination is not the result of a rigid formula disassociated from the consideration of the facts of a case
indeed the common sense of those skilled in the art demonstrates why some combinations would have been obvious where others would not
see ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 1739 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007)` the combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results`
thus we bear in mind that the goal of the claim 25 device was to allow a child to press a switch associated with a single_letter in a word and hear the sound of the letter as it is used in that word
in this way the child would both associate the sound of the letter with the letter itself and be able to sound out the word one letter at a time to learn to read phonetically
accommodating a prior_art mechanical device that accomplishes that goal to modern_electronics would have been reasonably obvious to one of ordinary_skill in designing childrens learning devices
applying modern_electronics to older mechanical devices has been commonplace in recent years

the bevan patent was one of the pieces of prior_art relied upon by the district_court and it describes an electro-mechanical learning toy
in the preferred embodiment of the bevan_device a housing contains a phonograph record as a voice_storage means a speaker for playing sounds from the voice_storage means and an actuated electric_motor to turn the record
uniquely shaped puzzle_pieces fit into correspondingly shaped openings in the top of the housing
depressing the puzzle_pieces in the openings causes the motor to turn the record and brings phonographic needles into contact with the portions of the record where the sounds associated with the puzzle_pieces are stored so that they can be played through the speaker
in one embodiment each puzzle_piece is imprinted with one letter from a word and pressing each puzzle_piece produces the sound of a single_letter in that word
thus although it relies on an electric_motor and mechanical structures rather than a processor and related electronics bevan teaches an apparatus that achieves the goals described above of associating letters with their sounds and encouraging children to sound out words phonetically through a similar type of interaction
we therefore see no clear_error in the district_courts finding that the bevan_device has the same method of operation viewed as a whole as claim 25 of leapfrogs ¡¬861_patent

a second piece of prior_art relied upon by the district_court was the texas_instruments_ssr
the ssr is a more modern type of prior_art learning toy constructed with electronic_components that has a slightly different mode of operation than bevan
the ssr has a hinged_plastic_housing that opens to lie flat
books for use with the toy fit into a recess in the housing
the housing contains switches that can detect when a child presses on different areas of the books pages
the housing also contains a processor memory and a speaker to produce sounds
in one mode of operation the ssr allows the child to press the first_letter of a word and hear the sound of that letter
the remainder of the letters in the word are grouped together and played together
for example the child can press the letter` t' and *1162 hear the t phoneme and then press` ug' to hear all the sounds in the word` tug'
similarly the child can press the letter` b' and then` ug' to hear the sounds in` bug'
the ssr does not include a reader that allows the processor to automatically identify the inserted book
instead the user can press a triangle printed on the first page of the book and the processor determines from the location of the triangle printed on the page which book is inserted
similarly the user can press a star on each page of the book and the processor determines from the location of the star on the page which page of the book is being viewed
thus the ssr provides a roadmap for one of ordinary_skill in the art desiring to produce an electronics-based learning toy for children that allows the use of phonetic-based learning methods including the association of individual letters with their phonemes

we agree with the district_court that one of ordinary_skill in the art of childrens learning toys would have found it obvious to combine the bevan_device with the ssr to update it using modern electronic_components in order to gain the commonly understood benefits of such adaptation such as decreased size increased reliability simplified operation and reduced cost
while the ssr only permits generation of a sound corresponding to the first_letter of a word it does so using electronic means
the combination is thus the adaptation of an old idea or invention bevan using newer_technology that is commonly available and understood in the art the ssr
we therefore also find no clear_error in the finding of the district_court that one of ordinary_skill in the art could have utilized the electronics of the ssr_device with the method of operation taught by bevan to allow a child to press each individual letter in a word and hear the individual phonemes associated with each letter to sound out the words

this combination of bevan and the ssr lacks only the` reader' of claim 25 of the ¡¬861_patent
the district_court found that readers were well-known in the art at the time of the invention
as there is ample evidence in the record to support that finding we find no clear_error in the courts determination
furthermore the reasons for adding a reader to the bevan/ssr combination are the same as those for using readers in other childrens toys-namely providing an added benefit and simplified use of the toy for the child in order to increase its marketability
leapfrog presents no evidence that the inclusion of a reader in this type of device was uniquely challenging or difficult for one of ordinary_skill in the art
see ksr 127 s.ct.at 1742
nor does leapfrog present any evidence that the inclusion of a device commonly used in the field of electronics a reader and even in the narrower art of electronic childrens toys represented an unobvious step over the prior_art
our conclusion is further reinforced by testimony from the sole inventor at trial that he did not have a technical background could not have actually built the prototype himself and relied on the assistance of an electrical engineer and sandia national laboratory to build a prototype of his invention

finally we do not agree with leapfrog that the court failed to give proper_consideration to secondary_considerations
the district_court explicitly stated in its opinion that leapfrog had provided substantial_evidence of commercial_success praise and long-felt need but that given the strength of the prima_facie_obviousness_showing the evidence on secondary_considerations was inadequate to overcome a final_conclusion that claim 25 would have been obvious
we have no basis to disagree with the district_courts conclusion

*1163 in light of our review of the evidence and the lack of any clear_error in the district_courts factual findings we agree with the district_courts conclusion that claim 25 of the ¡¬861 is invalid as obvious in view of the combination of bevan the ssr_device and the knowledge of one of ordinary_skill in the art concerning readers

conclusion
for the reasons stated we affirm the district_courts grant of judgment that fisher-prices powertouch_device does not infringe claim 25 of the ¡¬861_patent and that claim 25 of the ¡¬861_patent is invalid as obvious

affirmed
