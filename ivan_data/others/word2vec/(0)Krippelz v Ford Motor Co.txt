opinion
prost circuit_judge
this is a patent infringement case
defendant ford motor company` ford' appeals *1263 a $ 56 million judgment against it
ford argues that the district_court made a series of errors in both its infringement and validity analyses as well as in its award of enhanced damages for willful infringement
because the district_court erred in holding that the patent-in-suit could be found novel over the prior_art we reverse as to validity vacate the other rulings and remand for entry of judgment of non-liability

this cases lengthy history began in february 1989 when jacob_krippelz sr. now deceased filed for a patent on a vehicle-mounted lamp.1 mr._krippelz titled the resulting patent` emergency light'
u.s._patent_no._5017,903` ¡¬903_patent` at [ 54 ]
it described a lamp attached to the side_view_mirror of an automobile and shining downward

?
id
fig.1
as described by mr._krippelz the lamp was for use in inclement weather like rain or fog
its light would reflect off water dust or other airborne particles so as to be visible to other_drivers but not interfere with either their vision or that of the person driving the car
see generally id
col. 1
mr._krippelzs patent issued in 1991
he says he sent a copy of it to ford shortly thereafter but that ford was not interested in taking a license
for a period of years nothing happened

then in 1997 ford began offering a new option on its explorer and other model automobiles which we will refer to as a` puddle_light'
the puddle_light was a lamp attached to the vehicles side_view_mirror that shone light generally downward
fords puddle_light was equipped with a lens that diffused the light in such a way as to illuminate the vehicles side

mr._krippelz viewed the puddle_light as infringing and in 1998 he sued
complaint krippelz v. ford_motor_co. no._98- cv-2361 [ hereinafter krippelz ] n.d.ill
apr._16,_1998 ecf no._1
the case revolved around claim 2 of the ¡¬903_patent which reads 2
an emergency warning light for an automotive vehicle having a window on one side thereof comprising in combination
a housing mounted in a fixed substantially unadjustable position on said vehicle adjacent to said window said housing having an opening in the bottom thereof a source of light mounted within said housing for directing a conical_beam of light downwardly through said opening along said side of said vehicle below said window so as to be visible *1264 from in front of and behind said vehicle and
said opening and said source of light being positioned to prevent said beam of light from directly impinging on said side of said vehicle
¡¬903_patent_col. 3_l._19 -col. 4_l._3

about a year after filing the complaint mr._krippelz asked the patent and trademark office` pto' to reexamine the ¡¬903_patent
an information disclosure statement accompanying the request acknowledged the ongoing litigation noted that ford had raised invalidity as a defense and attached` all the references ford has identified to the requestor during the litigation'

the pto instituted reexamination proceedings and subsequently confirmed the validity of all the ¡¬903_patents claims over the submitted prior_art
see generally reexam
certificate u.s._patent_no._5017,903 c1 issued aug._13,_2002
as part of the reexamination process new claims were also added to the ¡¬903_patent which mr._krippelz states were subsequently asserted against ford in separate litigation
those claims are not part of this appeal

over the next several years the district_court handled a number of summary_judgment and claim construction issues which we will not recount except to state that there was much dispute about the appropriate manner in which to analyze fords puddle_lights for infringement
for our purposes we note that in 2008 mr._krippelz moved for summary_judgment of infringement which the court granted from the bench.2 tr
of nov._21,_2008 proceedings at 12:11-17 j.a
114 125

infringement having been summarily addressed the case proceeded to trial on validity and damages
ford argued that claim 2 was anticipated or at least rendered obvious by french patent no._1031,294 trans
( published june_22,_1953 j.a
13430 to dubois [ hereinafter dubois ]
dubois which did not appear in the ¡¬903_patent prosecution history taught a` system of lamps and optical_devices' for illuminating the pavement next to a vehicle
the idea was to give other_drivers a clear view of the vehicles side and the adjacent area so that they could know if there was enough room to pass
dubois j.a
13431
ford argued that dubois taught all the limitations of claim 2
mr._krippelz presented opinion testimony from an expert that dubois failed to teach two limitations namely a` conical_beam of light' and a lamp located` adjacent' to the vehicle window

the jury returned its verdict for mr._krippelz
it found the ¡¬903_patent valid over dubois and awarded $ 23 million in damages for fords infringement
jury verdict krippelz n.d.ill.big_token__dec._12 _2008__big_token ecf no._429
following a bench trial on willfulness the court found fords infringement *1265 willful and awarded mr._krippelz a further $ 11.7 million in prejudgment interest and another $ 21 million in enhanced damages
see krippelz 670_f.supp.2d_806_(n.d.ill.2009) concerning willfulness ; krippelz 670_f.supp.2d_815 n.d.ill.2009 concerning damages ; krippelz 675_f.supp.2d_881_(n.d.ill.2009) making fact findings and conclusions of law

ford moved for judgment of invalidity as a matter of law ; its motion was denied
krippelz 750_f.supp.2d_938 n.d.ill.2010 [ hereinafter jmol_op_. ]
ford timely appealed
this court has jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
we hold that the district_court committed reversible_error in denying jmol of invalidity by anticipation over dubois and so reverse
this court reviews denial of a motion for jmol under the law of the pertinent regional circuit here the seventh
seachange int l inc. v. c-cor inc. 413_f.3d_1361 1367-68 fed.cir.2005
in that circuit an appellate courts inquiry into the denial of a jmol motion is` limited to the question whether the evidence presented combined with all reasonable inferences permissibly drawn therefrom is sufficient to support the verdict when viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is directed'
campbell v. miller 499_f.3d_711 716 7th cir.2007 internal quotation marks omitted
such review is de novo
waters v. city of chicago 580_f.3d_575 580 7th cir.2009
reversal is warranted only if no reasonable juror could have found for the nonmoving party
id
to show that a patent claim is invalid as anticipated the accused infringer must show by clear and convincing evidence that a single_prior_art_reference discloses each and every element of a claimed invention
silicon graphics inc. v. ati techs. inc. 607_f.3d_784 796 fed.cir.2010

in this case the district_court supported its denial of jmol with two potential grounds on which a jury could find for mr._krippelz
first the court held that a reasonable_jury could find that dubois failed to teach the required` conical_beam of light'
second the court held that a reasonable_jury could find that dubois lacked the required lamp` adjacent to the window'
see jmol op. 750 f.supp.2d at 943-46
we reject both grounds as unsupported by the evidence

a
we turn first to the` conical_beam of light'
the trial_court construed this term to mean` a beam of light that diverges' and it construed` beam of light' to mean` light that both is directed and has a defined sweep range'
id.at 944
we see no error in these constructions and the parties do not contest them per se
however the district_court made further statements concerning the interpretation of these terms that require a detailed look at the ¡¬903_patents intrinsic evidence
see phillips v. awh corp. 415_f.3d_1303 1317 fed.cir.2005 en banc

when instructing the jury the district_court stated that proving the presence of` directed' light-which was a prerequisite to showing a` conical_beam of light' -required proof that` the filament of the light_bulb is at or near the focal_point of an optical reflector'
trial tr
961:16-18 j.a
9597
it further told the jury that` parabolic and elliptical reflectors are types of optical reflectors'
id.at 961:18-19 j.a
9597
these statements correctly interpreted claim 2s requirements.3

*1266 the ¡¬903 specification is a single page in length
its most substantive discussion concerning the` conical_beam of light' comes in its disclosure of a preferred embodiment as best shown in fig._4 a source of light in the form of a light_bulb 20 is mounted in the rearview_mirror_assembly 14 directly behind a mirror 22 which faces towards the rear of the vehicle
a circular opening 24 is provided in the bottom of the housing 25 and the light_source 20 which is suitably mounted in the housing 25 for access through the opening 24 directs a conical_beam of light onto the pavement 12 immediately adjacent to the vehicle
a light_source identical to the source 20 is similarly mounted in the rearview_mirror_assembly 18 on the passenger_side of the vehicle and it also directs a conical_beam of light 28 onto the pavement 12 adjacent to the passenger_side of the vehicle
the beams 26_and_28 have an included angle of approximately thirty degrees and consequently they do not shine into the car 10 nor do they radiate any light which shines directly toward any approaching vehicles
¡¬903_patent_col. 2_ll._19 -37 emphases added
the ¡¬903_patent description thus includes no reference to the focal_points of a reflector or to the reflectors shape as elliptical or parabolic
similarly the prosecution history of the ¡¬903_patent on initial examination is bereft of such discussion
were we to consider the ¡¬903_patents specification and initial prosecution history alone then we would find it difficult to affirm the district_courts holding that the term` beam of light' incorporates requirements concerning the shape and focal_point of the reflector

but references to such requirements emerged while the ¡¬903_patent was under reexamination at the pto
a patentees statements during reexamination can be considered during claim construction in keeping with the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer
am
piledriving equip. inc. v. geoquip inc. 637_f.3d_1324 1336 fed.cir.2011

during reexamination the examiner rejected claim 2 as obvious over two references` kim' and` matsuda
`` 4 mr._krippelz appealed to the board of patent appeals and interferences
endeavoring to traverse the rejection mr._krippelz attacked kim` the device of kim does not produce a beam of light
rather the light produced by the kim device is very diffuse and not collimated and consequently not a beam of light'
krippelz_reexam
appeal br. supra_note 4 at 7 emphasis added
mr._krippelz also directed the boards attention to a prior_art statement that` in a bulb and reflector system a filament of the bulb is placed at or near a focal_point of a reflector
the light emitted by the bulb filament is collected by the reflector and reflected outward to form a light_beam'
id
( quoting u.s._patent_no._5365,412 filed jan._7,_1993 issued nov._15,_1994 col. 1_ll._13 -17 emphases added

mr._krippelz submitted a declaration from dr. richard hansler-the same expert who mr._krippelz would subsequently call to testify at trial in this case and *1267 whose expert opinions mr._krippelz offered to the district_court on summary_judgment
mr._krippelzs appeal brief quoted dr._hanslers declaration` [ t ] he reflecting surface of kim lacks sufficient symmetry to produce a beam of light which typically has the light_bulb at or near the focal_point of a reflector'
krippelz_reexam
appeal_br.at 8 emphasis added

in response the examiner maintained his position that the claim was obvious
mr._krippelzs reply repeated his belief that the combination failed to teach the required` beam of light' and continued to focus on kim
he submitted further quotations from dr._hanslers declaration [ t ] he device disclosed in kim does not appear to be a parabolic reflector or other optical reflective surface
it appears rather that the shape of the reflector of kim assuming that the internal surfaces are reflective corresponds to the shape of the shroud or cover the interior surface of which does not appear to be an optical surface that could be used to create a beam of light

as mentioned above the board subsequently reversed the examiner and confirmed the patentability of claim 2
ex parte krippelz no._2001-1441 slip op. j.a
13073 b.p.a.i
feb._25,_2002

mr._krippelzs statements are of course now part of the intrinsic record
taking them into account we agree with the district_court that the term` conical_beam of light' as used in the ¡¬903_patent and in light of mr._krippelzs arguments during reexamination incorporates limitations as to the shape of the reflector and the positioning of the light_source relative to it
as a result of these statements mr._krippelz disclaimed lamps lacking these limitations and the limitations therefore became part of the properly construed claims
as the district_court properly concluded mr._krippelzs claimed invention thus requires 1 a reflector having a focal_point such as a parabolic or elliptical reflector and 2 positioning of the light_source at or near the reflectors focal_point
we therefore affirm the district_courts construction of` conical_beam of light'

having determined that the district_court properly construed the claim we nevertheless find reversible_error in its holding that a reasonable_jury could find that dubois lacked the required disclosure
dubois expressly teaches that with respect to the figure 17 diagram its lamp could` include a bulb 27 at the focus of a reflector 28 [ ] the shell of which includes a prolongation 29 forming a screen to prevent the light rays from directly striking the eyes of a driver or pedestrian positioned in front of or behind the vehicle'
dubois trans at 2 j.a
13432 emphasis added
this language expressly satisfies the requirement of a light_beam that is both directed and that is generated by a bulb-reflector_combination in which the bulb is located at the focal_point of the reflector
dubois further teaches that its light could be a` headlight' which dovetails neatly with mr._krippelzs express acknowledgement that in the bulb-reflector_combination producing the required light_beam` the reflector element can be part of the light_bulb as in a spot light type of lamp bulb'
see krippelz_reexam
appeal_br.at 3

in denying jmol the district_court cited several varieties of evidence to overcome these disclosures in dubois
but that evidence whether viewed separately or collectively was legally insufficient to support a judgment for krippelz

*1268 first the district_court cited the testimony of dr._hansler the expert called by mr._krippelz concerning` ray traces' he had performed on a lamp diagram in dubois
see dubois fig.17 j.a
12489 ; see also trial tr
510:17-511:13 j.a
9012-13
dr._hansler testified that he had measured the diagram and from those measurements extrapolated the angles of incidence and reflection that would result if a lamp were built to those measurements
dr._hansler opined that the light from such a lamp would scatter and so not produce the required` conical_beam of light'
trial tr
511:12-13 j.a
9013
the district_court cited this testimony as support for the jurys verdict
jmol op. 750 f.supp.2d at 944

this court has repeatedly cautioned against overreliance on drawings that are neither expressly to scale nor linked to quantitative values in the specification
see nystrom v. trex co. 424_f.3d_1136 1149 fed.cir.2005 ; hockerson-halberstadt inc. v. avia grp
int l inc. 222_f.3d_951 956 fed.cir.2000 ; in re wright 569_f.2d_1124 1127 ccpa 1977
however ford does not appeal and so we do not take up the trial_courts denial of fords motion to exclude dr._hanslers ray trace diagrams
see tr
of dec._8,_2008 proceedings at 39:19-22 j.a
8349 8387
in light of fords decision to not appeal the admission of this evidence it was properly before the jury
on the basis of dr._hanslers testimony we can not say that no reasonable_jury could have concluded that figure 17s disclosure was not anticipating

nevertheless it was reversible_error for the district_court to hold the jurys verdict sustainable on this testimony because figure 17 depicts just one embodiment of the dubois invention
dubois expressly states that other embodiments could use lamps in addition to the one disclosed in its figures including` a headlight parking light or other body light'
dubois at 2 j.a
13432
the evidence at trial-including testimony from dr._hansler himself-was that a headlight as that word was used in dubois creates a` beam of light'
trial tr
531:25-532:2 j.a
9033-34
dr._hanslers` ray trace' diagrams of figure 17 notwithstanding there is no question that duboiss disclosure of a` headlight' teaches the required` beam of light'

dr._hansler also opined to the jury that any beam in dubois even if it was a beam did not anticipate because it was not necessarily` conical'
he pointed to duboiss discussion of` lighting the pavement obliquely on the surface of a rectangle' adjacent to the vehicle
jmol op. 750 f.supp.2d at 945 ; see also dubois trans at 2 j.a
13432
dr._hansler testified that it is` not possible' for a conical_beam of light to illuminate a rectangle
trial tr
555:14-19 j.a
9957
while expressing some skepticism about this reasoning the district_court nevertheless held that a jury could reasonably agree with it

we disagree as a matter of law
while dubois discusses illuminating the area within a rectangle on the pavement next to the car nowhere does it require that such illumination be only with non-conical light_beams
indeed many figures in dubois depict triangles of light extending from various lamps to the surface of the ground
there is no language in dubois disavowing the most natural interpretation of those triangles i.e. as two-dimensional depictions of light cones
further there are numerous disclosures in dubois of using multiple lamps to illuminate the target area
this undermines dr._hanslers testimony that` [ a ] conical_beam of light such as one gets from a flashlight would not be capable of illuminating a large area'
trial tr
512:20-24 j.a
9014
taken as a whole dr._hanslers testimony that the` conical' limitation was unsatisfied failed *1269 to take into account the entire dubois disclosure
his generic statements that the` conical' limitation was unmet were therefore too conclusory to sustain the jurys verdict.5 see sitrick v. dreamworks llc 516_f.3d_993 1001 fed.cir.2008 holding on summary_judgment that such conclusory testimony could not create a triable issue of fact

finally the court cited testimony from mr._krippelzs expert that a conical_beam of light` probably would n't be a very effective way to accomplish the purpose of dubois' and from that reasoned that the jury could reasonably have held that dubois` actually teaches away from using a beam'
jmol op. 750 f.supp.2d at 945-46
first and foremost teaching away is not relevant to an anticipation analysis ; it is only a component of an obviousness analysis
celeritas techs. ltd. v. rockwell int l corp. 150_f.3d_1354 1361 fed.cir.1998
secondly the opinions of dr._hansler are not a substitute for the actual dubois disclosure
when all elements of the device are shown in a single_prior_art_reference as here the question of` teaching away' does not arise

we thus conclude that the district_court committed clear error in denying jmol on the basis of duboiss putative failure to disclose the required` conical_beam of light'

b
the courts holding that the jury could have reasonably found dubois to lack a lamp` adjacent to the window' was also reversible_error
figures 5_and_6 of dubois plainly show such a lamp

?
dubois trans
figs
5 6 j.a
13435
the district_court again quoted dr._hansler who` testified that while in one illustrated position the devicemight be adjacentit certainly is not clearly adjacent to a side_window
`` jmol op. 750 f.supp.2d at 944 emphasis added
as already mentioned the conclusory testimony of an expert witness however can not create an issue of fact if none otherwise exists
sitrick 516 f.3d at 1001
there is no question that a person of ordinary skill reviewing these figures would understand them to show mounting the lamp adjacent to the side_window
we therefore conclude that the district_court erred in denying fords motion for jmol of invalidity.6 that decision is therefore reversed
claim 2 is invalid for anticipation by dubois

*1270 iii
because claim 2 of the ¡¬903_patent is invalid we need not reach the other issues put forward by the parties i.e. the district_courts summary_judgment of infringement and its willfulness_analysis
those decisions are now moot and as such are vacated

we therefore reverse the district_courts denial of jmol of invalidity vacate its summary_judgment of infringement and its willfulness_analysis and remand for entry of judgment of non-liability for ford

reversed-in-part vacated-in-part and remanded

the parties briefing and oral argument focused on the district_courts approach to interpreting the claim and analyzing infringement
the district_court adjudged fords puddle_lights infringing even though they have a plastic lens on their outside through which light shines onto the car
the court treated the lens as an` additional element' not to be considered in the infringement_analysis
ford contended that this was improper as it led to the surprising result that the ford_lamps-which undisputedly illuminated the side of the car-were held to practice the claims requirement of` prevent [ ing ] [ the ] beam of light from directly impinging on said side of said vehicle'
because of our conclusion that claim 2 of the ¡¬903_patent is invalid irrespective of how this issue might be resolved we decline to take up the district_courts order that the ford_lamps be analyzed for infringement without regard to their attached plastic lenses or to those lenses effect on whether the beam of light did or did not` directly imping [ e ]' on the vehicle side

though it is unnecessary to reach the issue here we further believe that the requirement of a light_beam that is` conical' ignoring for the moment the reasons just discussed why dubois satisfies that limitation would almost certainly be an obvious modification to dubois precluding patentability under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

over the course of the trial the district_court barred ford from presenting to the jury arguments for possible invalidity over a separate reference referred to in the briefing as` miazzo'
because we conclude that claim 2 is invalid over dubois the question of whether the district_court was or was not entitled to remove miazzo from the case is moot and we decline to address it
