accordingly we reverse

i
background
this hatch-waxman_case is based on tolmars filing of an abbreviated new drug application` anda' seeking approval to market a generic_version of differinthe_r_gel 0.3 % which is a topical medication containing 0.3 % by weight adapalene approved for the treatment of acne
on january 21 2010 galderma sued tolmar in the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware alleging that tolmars anda product infringed certain claims of the ¡¬377_patent
galderma subsequently filed amended complaints alleging infringement of each of the asserted patents
after a bench_trial the district_court ruled against tolmar on several issues of which only invalidity under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is at issue in this appeal

a. patented technology
the asserted patents include both composition claims and claims directed to methods of treating acne using pharmaceutical compositions
at trial galderma alleged infringement of claims 35_and_36 of the ¡¬181_patent claims 24_and_27 of the ¡¬060_patent claim 5 of the ¡¬558_patent and claims 40_and_41 of the ¡¬044_patent1 each of the asserted_claims requires an aqueous gel or cream that includes 0.3 % by weight of adapalene
the asserted_claims also recite one or more inactive excipients included in the gel or cream
claim 5 of the ¡¬558_patent is representative

5
a topically applicable pharmaceutical composition comprising 0.3 % by weight of [ adapalene ] relative to the total_weight of the composition effective for the treatment of acne formulated into a topically applicable pharmaceutically acceptable medium therefor said composition being in the form of a topically applicable pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous gel comprising at least one carbomer gelling agent and wherein the sole anti-acne ingredient is adapalene
b
prior art
below tolmar based its obviousness_argument primarily on three pieces of prior_art u.s. patent no._4717,720` shroot_¡¬720_patent` u.s. *735 reissue no._34440` shroot_¡¬440_patent` and the differinthe_r 0.1 %_gel_data_sheet` data_sheet'

the shroot_¡¬720_patent specifically discloses and claims adapalene along with other inventive_compounds
col. 3_ll._9 -10 ; col. 4_ll._29 -37 ; col. 9_ll._39 -54 ; col. 19 l.17-col. 20_l._19
four of the seven composition examples in the shroot_¡¬720_patent disclose adapalene as the active_ingredient in concentrations of 0.001 % 0.1 % and 1 %
col. 16_ll._35 -53 ; col. 17_ll._20 -52
the specification of the shroot_¡¬720_patent states repeatedly that the inventive_compounds are useful for the treatment of acne
see col. 4_ll._53 -59 ; see also col. 5_ll._49 -53
moreover the specification states that the inventive_compounds can be used in concentrations` preferably between 0.big_token__01_and_1__big_token weight percent based on the total_weight of the composition'
shroot ¡¬ 720 patent col. 5_ll._61 -64
finally the shroot_¡¬720_patent indicates that the inventive_compounds` are less irritating than known retinoids of analogous structure'
col. 4_ll._48 -51
the shroot_¡¬440_patent is largely similar to the shroot_¡¬720_patent but also contains claim 4 which recites a preferred_range of 0.big_token__01_to_1__big_token % for cosmetic compositions which include the inventive_compounds e.g. adapalene as the active_ingredient
shroot_¡¬440_patent col. 20_ll._15 -18
notably prior to their expiration the shroot_patents were listed in the fdas orange book as covering galdermas prior_art differinthe_r 0.1 %_gel as well as differinthe_r_gel 0.3 %

the data_sheet is the product insert for galdermas earlier launched adapalene product
the data_sheet discloses 0.1 %_adapalene as a treatment for acne
it also discloses all but one of the inactive_ingredients listed in the asserted_claims
other than the dosage of adapalene the only difference between the claimed formulations and the formulation taught by the data_sheet is that the data_sheet discloses` poloxamer 182' while certain asserted_claims list` poloxamer 124'

in addition to the shroot_patents and the data_sheet tolmar provided other_relevant_evidence
for instance a 1989 article by jamoulle_et_al
describes the use of a lotion containing 0.3 %_adapalene in an animal_model to determine whether adapalene was suitable for the treatment of acne
the authors concluded from this test that adapalene was` particularly suitable for the treatment of acne'

obviousness
the determination of invalidity for reasons of obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a legal conclusion based on underlying facts
graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
following a bench_trial we` review the district_courts factual_findings for clear_error and its conclusions of law de novo'
winner int l royalty corp. v. wang 202_f.3d_1340 1344-45 fed.cir.2000

factual considerations that underlie the obviousness_inquiry include the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention the level of ordinary_skill in the art and any relevant secondary_considerations
see graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684
relevant secondary_considerations include commercial_success long-felt but unsolved needs failure of others and unexpected_results
ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 406 127_s.ct._1727 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) ; in re soni 54_f.3d_746 750 fed.cir.1995
because patents are presumed valid tolmar was required to prove that the asserted_claims were obvious by clear and convincing_evidence
see microsoft corp. v. i4i ltd. p'ship -- - u.s. -- -- 131_s.ct._2238 2242 180_l.ed.2d_131_(2011)

tolmar presents an obviousness_case that is both straightforward and potent
at the time of the invention adapalene was a known compound and the prior_art shroot_patents disclose topical adapalene compositions for the purpose of treating acne in a preferred_range of 0.01 % -1 % including several exemplary formulations containing adapalene in various concentrations
the asserted_claims are directed to 0.3 % topical adapalene compositions for the treatment of acne which fall within the concentration range disclosed in the shroot_patents
thus the shroot_patents disclose all of the limitations of the asserted_claims except for a precise teaching of 0.3 %_adapalene and the specific_inactive_ingredients of the asserted_claims
the specific_inactive_ingredients of the asserted_claims are however taught by the data_sheet

the data_sheet discloses each of the inactive_ingredients except for poloxamer 124
however the district_court found poloxamer 124 equivalent to poloxamer 182 which is disclosed in the data_sheet
moreover the district_court held that` the record evidence establishes that the inactive_ingredients in the claimed formulations [ were ] routine and obvious and therefore non-inventive'
*737 galderma_labs. l.p. v. tolmar inc. 891_f.supp.2d_588 645 d.del.2012
notably on appeal the parties do not dispute the obviousness of the inactive_ingredients of the formulation
rather the sole dispute between the parties is whether it was obvious to use a 0.3 %_adapalene_composition for the treatment of acne
accordingly tolmar argues that the asserted_claims are obvious because they claim nothing more than the use of an old compound for a known purpose in a concentration that falls within a range disclosed in the prior_art as preferred for that purpose

tolmar buttresses its obviousness_argument with other_relevant_evidence
this evidence includes a study that used a lotion containing 0.3 %_adapalene in an animal_model to determine that adapalene was` particularly suitable for the treatment of acne'
j.a
13063
additionally the prior_art showed that 0.03 % and 0.1 %_adapalene_products were suitable for the treatment of acne and that 0.3 %_adapalene_products were suitable for the treatment of other_conditions without intolerable_irritability
moreover the prior_art indicated that dermatologists desired acne treatments that came in varying concentrations
according to tolmar this provides further motivation to select a 0.3 %_adapalene_composition for the treatment of acne

the district_court rejected tolmars obviousness_case finding that tolmar` failed to establish by clear and convincing_evidence that the claimed inventions would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill at the time of the invention'
galderma_labs. 891 f.supp.2d at 637
in reaching this conclusion the district_court relied heavily on evidence showing that increasing the dose of adapalene was likely to increase the incidence of certain_side_effects and evidence showing that 0.1 % was considered the optimal adapalene_concentration for the treatment of acne
id.at 641-42
in addition the court found` that at least two secondary_considerations unexpected_results and commercial_success additionally support the determination that the asserted_claims are not invalid due to obviousness'
id.at 642-44

prior to addressing the obviousness of the asserted_claims we note an error in the district_courts obviousness analysis
the district_court framed the obviousness_inquiry as requiring tolmar to provide motivation in the prior_art to triple the concentration of adapalene from 0.1 % to 0.3 %
id.at 638
tolmar carried no such burden
rather tolmar like all those who seek to prove claims obvious was required to show that` the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103
nothing in the statute or our case law requires tolmar to prove obviousness by starting with a prior_art_commercial_embodiment and then providing motivation to alter that commercial_embodiment
see ksr 550 u.s. at 419 127_s.ct._1727` in determining whether the subject matter of a patent claim is obvious neither the particular motivation nor the avowed purpose of the patentee controls
what matters is the objective reach of the claim
if the claim extends to what is obvious it is invalid under ¡± 103`
this is particularly true where as here the prior_art teaches a range that encompasses both the prior_art_commercial_embodiment and the claimed invention

the relevant dispute in this case is thus not over whether the prior_art discloses all of the claim elements or over the motivation to combine the prior_art references
rather the dispute is whether there was motivation to select the claimed 0.3 %_adapalene_composition in the disclosed *738 range
in these circumstances where there is a range disclosed in the prior_art and the claimed invention falls within that range the burden of production falls upon the patentee to come forward with evidence that 1 the prior_art taught away from the claimed invention ; 2 there were new and unexpected_results relative to the prior_art ; or 3 there are other pertinent secondary_considerations
see novo nordisk a/s v. caraco pharm
labs. ltd. 719_f.3d_1346 1352-54 fed.cir.2013

accordingly tolmar having demonstrated that the prior_art taught a range of concentrations of adapalene for the treatment of acne that encompasses the claimed 0.3 %_adapalene_composition we now examine the district_courts findings with respect to the factors listed above to determine whether the claims are invalid as obvious
the ultimate burden of proving obviousness rests with tolmar

a
teaching away
despite express teachings in the shroot_patents indicating that adapalene would be useful in concentrations preferably between 0.01 % and 1 % the district_court found that the prior_art taught away from a 0.3 %_adapalene_composition
the district_court based its conclusion primarily on two related grounds.3 first according to the district_court the prior_art taught` away from the selection of 0.3 %_adapalene for the treatment of acne because of dose-dependent increases in side_effects'
galderma_labs. 891 f.supp.2d at 641_n._8
and second the prior_art taught that 0.1 % was the optimal_concentration of adapalene for the treatment of acne
id.at 641-42
we leave undisturbed the district_courts findings that increasing the dose of adapalene would result in a concomitant increase in side_effects and that 0.1 % was the optimal_concentration of adapalene for the treatment of acne at the time of the invention
however to the extent the court found that these facts taught away from the claimed invention it clearly erred

a reference may be said to teach away when a person of ordinary_skill upon reading the reference would be discouraged from following the path set out in the reference or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by the applicant
a reference does not teach away however if it merely expresses a general preference for an alternative invention but does not criticize discredit or otherwise discourage investigation into the invention claimed
depuy_spine inc. v. medtronic sofamor danek inc. 567_f.3d_1314 1327 fed.cir.2009
with respect to the prior_art teachings of dose-dependent side_effects the district_court relied on the verschoore 1991 and alirezai 1996 articles which show that the increase in adapalene_concentration from 0.03 % to 0.1 % resulted in an increase in side_effects
neither of these articles mentions 0.3 %_adapalene_compositions nor do they expressly teach away from the claimed invention
the district_court inferred that these references taught away from a further_tripling of the adapalene_concentration
we can not agree with this inference
these articles show increased side_effects associated with 0.1 %_adapalene as *739 compared to 0.03 %_adapalene yet they failed to discourage even the use of 0.1 %_adapalene
to the contrary as the district_court found 0.1 % was the optimal_concentration of adapalene at the time of the invention
galderma_labs. 891 f.supp.2d at 641-42
moreover there is nothing in either of these references to indicate that increasing the concentration to 0.3 % would be unproductive nor do these articles indicate in any way that the side_effects would be serious enough to dissuade the development of a 0.3 %_adapalene_product
therefore the verschoore 1991 and alirezai 1996 articles fail to teach away from the claimed invention

the district_court relied on the allec 1997 verschoore 1997 and czernielewski 2001 articles to demonstrate that 0.1 % was the standard or optimal_concentration of adapalene for the treatment of acne
the court concluded that this fact teaches away from 0.3 %_adapalene_compositions
it does not
`` a reference does not teach away.. if it.. does notcriticize discredit or otherwise discourage investigation into the invention claimed'
depuy_spine 567 f.3d at 1327 citing in re fulton 391_f.3d_1195 1201 fed.cir.2004
a teaching that a composition may be optimal or standard does not criticize discredit or otherwise discourage investigation into other compositions
accordingly the allec 1997 verschoore 1997 and czernielewski 2001 articles do not teach away from the claimed invention

b
unexpected_results
the district_court found that the comparable_tolerability of 0.1 % and 0.3 %_adapalene was unexpected in view of the prior_art since a skilled_artisan would have expected that tripling the concentration of adapalene would have resulted in a clinically significant_increase in side_effects
galderma_labs. 891 f.supp.2d at 642-44
while we agree that this result was unexpected it does not constitute an unexpected result that is probative of nonobviousness

unexpected results that are probative of nonobviousness are those that are` different in kind and not merely in degree from the results of the prior_art'
iron_grip_barbell_co. v. usa_sports inc. 392_f.3d_1317 1322 fed.cir.2004 citation omitted
results which differ by percentages are differences in degree rather than kind where the modification of the percentage is within the capabilities of one skilled in the art at the time
see in re harris 409_f.3d_1339 1344 fed.cir.2005 finding increased efficacy measured by percentages to be a difference of degree and not of kind ; in re budde 50_c.c.p.a._1491 319_f.2d_242 246 1963 finding no unexpected_results where ranges of reaction time and temperature constituted only a difference in degree rather than in kind ; in re aller 42_c.c.p.a._824 220_f.2d_454 456-57 1955 finding no unexpected_results where improved yields over the prior_art measured by percentages reflect a difference in degree not in kind
thus where an unexpected increase in efficacy is measured by a small percentage as here and the evidence indicates that skilled_artisans were capable of adjusting the percentage the result constitutes a difference in degree not kind
so too where an increase by a percentage is expected but not found that result is also likely only a difference in degree
in this case the expected result was an increase by some percentage in the prevalence of certain_side_effects
the failure of that percent increase to materialize though unexpected constitutes only a difference in degree from the prior_art results
accordingly the comparable_tolerability of 0.1 % and 0.3 %_adapalene does not indicate that the asserted_claims are non-obvious

*740 c. commercial success
`` evidence of commercial_success.. is only significant if there is a nexus between the claimed invention and the commercial_success'
ormco_corp. v. align tech. inc. 463_f.3d_1299 1311-12 fed.cir.2006
`` when a patentee can demonstrate commercial_success usually shown by significant sales in a relevant market and that the successful product is the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent it is presumed that the commercial_success is due to the patented_invention'
j.t
eaton & co. v. atlantic paste & glue co. 106_f.3d_1563 1571 fed.cir.1997
however` if the feature that creates the commercial_success was known in the prior_art the success is not pertinent'
ormco_corp. 463 f.3d at 1311-12 ; see also j.t
eaton 106 f.3d at 1571` [ t ] he asserted commercial_success of the product must be due to the merits of the claimed invention beyond what was readily available in the prior_art'

the district_court found that` [ t ] he commercial_success of galdermas 0.3 %_adapalene_product also supports a finding of nonobviousness'
galderma_labs. 891 f.supp.2d at 644
the district_court gave two reasons for its finding
first differinthe_r 0.3 % galdermas commercial_embodiment of the claims` quickly gained and maintained market_share-even in the face of an overall declining market and decreasing promotional expenditures and while facing competition from generic 0.1 %_adapalene_formulations'
id
second the court found` that tolmar along with another anda filer actavis seeks to enter the market precisely because differinthe_r 0.3 % has been commercially successful'
id
we discuss these findings in reverse order

the mere fact that generic pharmaceutical companies seek approval to market a generic_version of a drug without more is not evidence of commercial_success that speaks to the non-obviousness of patent claims
plainly tolmar believes that it can make a profit selling a generic_version of the claimed invention
this is likely true in all hatch-waxman_cases if not all patent cases generally
however that fact tells us very little about the level of commercial_success of the patented_invention relative to the prior_art or the extent to which the commercial_success of the branded drug is` due to the merits of the claimed invention beyond what was readily available in the prior_art'
j.t
eaton 106 f.3d at 1571
as such it does not support a finding of non-obviousness

the court also relied on the fact that differinthe_r_gel 0.3 % quickly gained and maintained market_share to find commercial_success
we do not disturb this finding
however we note that it is of limited value in determining whether or not the presently asserted_claims are obvious
`` commercial success is relevant because the law presumes an idea would successfully have been brought to market sooner in response to market forces had the idea been obvious to persons skilled in the art'
merck & co. v. teva pharm
usa inc. 395_f.3d_1364 1376 fed.cir.2005
where` market_entry by others was precluded [ due to blocking patents ] the inference of non-obviousness of [ the asserted_claims ] from evidence of commercial_success is weak'
id.at 1377
this principle applies forcefully to the present case

the now expired shroot_patents blocked the market_entry of 0.3 %_adapalene_products until their expiration in 2010 long after galderma invented 0.3 %_adapalene_compositions of the asserted_claims
as such no entity other than galderma could have successfully brought to 0.3 % to market prior to 2010
like the commercial *741 success described in merck & co. the commercial_success of differinthe_r_gel 0.3 % is of` minimal probative value'
id.at 1376
accordingly we conclude the district_court erred in adjudging this factor as confirming its conclusion of nonobviousness

iii
conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we hold that claims 35_and_36 of the ¡¬181_patent claims 24_and_27 of the ¡¬060_patent claim 5 of the ¡¬558_patent and claims 40_and_41 of the ¡¬044_patent are invalid as obvious
we therefore reverse the district_courts finding that the claims are valid

reversed

newman circuit_judge dissenting
without doubt the question of obviousness here presented is a close call
however when the question is close when it turns on findings and interpretations of biologic and medicinal evidence when the application of law to fact invokes the policy of the patent statute to advance the useful arts then the findings and rulings of the trial_court warrant particular attention on appellate review

here the district_court fully explored the evidence relating to whether it would have been obvious to increase by 300 % the concentration of the active_ingredient adapalene without increasing its known adverse side_effects
the district judge held an eight-day bench_trial heard thirteen live witnesses including expert witnesses of stature and experience and received evidence and argument from both sides
the court issued an opinion with over 50 pages on the issue of obviousness finding the facts and weighing the evidence and applying the law with thoughtful explanation and reasoning.1

my colleagues on this panel give scant attention to the district_courts analysis instead making their own_findings and applying flawed procedural and substantive law
my colleagues do not identify clear_error in the district_courts findings ; instead they distort the burdens of proof and production ignore the applicable standard of proof and rely on their own factual determinations and creative theories of law and eradicate the patent

the district_court ruled that there was not clear and convincing_evidence of invalidity
by contrast my colleagues announce their rule whereby a broad teaching that includes the patented_invention removes the statutory_presumption of validity and without more establishes obviousness
see maj. op.at 737-38` where there is a range disclosed in the prior_art and the claimed invention falls within that range the burden of production falls upon the patentee..'
although the majority mentions the requirement of clear and convincing_evidence of invalidity the majority presumes that the prior_art establishes invalidity and places on the patentee the burden of establishing patentability based on` secondary_considerations'
the majority goes on to impose a new and unprecedented view of these considerations

for example although the panel_majority concedes that there are unexpected_results for the concentration selected by the patentee see maj. op.at 739` we agree that this result was unexpected' my colleagues do not require the patent challenger to show any reason in the prior_art or common sense for selection of this embodiment with its unexpected_properties
rather they hold that unless a skilled_artisan was not` capable of adjusting the percentage' id. the extent of the change in percentage here 300 % and the unexpected *742 results and properties are irrelevant to patentability

in refusing to credit any of the demonstrated` secondary_considerations' my colleagues foreclose patentability to a vast_body of improvement_patents
in the field of medicaments the denial of patentability for improvements is a disincentive to the development of such improvements
the losers are those afflicted with disease
i respectfully dissent

discussion
particularly for close questions of patentability the district_courts findings and assessments of credibility and weight of evidence and the district_courts application of law to found facts compel appellate attention
the role of the trial_court in considering the evidence that each party provides through examination and cross-examination of witnesses and documents with judicial elaboration and interaction can not be matched on appeal
as the supreme_court stated in anderson v. bessemer_city` duplication of the trial_judges efforts in the court of appeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources'
470_u.s._564 574-75 105_s.ct._1504 84_l.ed.2d_518_(1985)

clear and convincing_evidence is required to overcome the statutory_presumption of validity of a duly granted patent
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 a patent is presumed valid ; cardinal chem co. v. morton int l 508_u.s._83 93_n._15 113_s.ct._1967 124_l.ed.2d_1_(1993) invalidity must be proved by clear and convincing_evidence
here the panel_majority does not provide clear and convincing_evidence of invalidity
instead the majority discards the trial_judges findings on the premise of a presumption of invalidity that the majority applies to` selection' inventions that is inventions within a known class or range of technology for which the majority discards the established procedural and substantive burdens
the majority makes its own factual_findings and writes new law

in contrast to the panel_majoritys dismissive analysis the district_courts findings reflect careful examination of all of the evidence
nonetheless my colleagues conclude that the selection of a 300 % increase in dosage was obvious after the unexpected_properties of the increase were discovered by this patentee
i summarize some of the evidence before the district_court whose findings well support the conclusion that invalidity on the ground of obviousness was not established by clear and convincing_evidence

i
the prior art
in this hatch-waxman_case tolmar inc. seeks to invalidate galdermas patents on the commercially successful acne medication whose active_ingredient is the retinoid adapalene in 0.3 %_concentration
there was extensive prior_art showing retinoids including adapalene in a range of concentrations for various uses and showing the prior selection of 0.1 %_adapalene for treatment of acne because higher concentrations were shown to be unduly irritative to acne-ridden skin

the district_court found that the knowledge in the field taught away from the 0.3 %_concentration based on the expert_testimony and documentary_evidence at trial
the district_court applying the correct_standard held that tolmar did not prove invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence

*743 the shroot patents 1988 1992 1993 2
these are galdermas now-expired patents on benzonaphthalene derivatives including adapalene and their use to treat acne
the issue is the selection of the 0.3 %_adapalene_concentration in the patents-in-suit

the district_court found that` the [ shroot ] range of 0.0005 % to 5 % for topical compositions covers four orders of magnitude or a 10,000-fold dosage range' and that` even thepreferred range of 0.01 % to 1 % is a hundredfold dosage range'
dct
op.at 609
the district_court found that` [ f ] rom this large genus of potential treatments galderma selected 0.1 %_adapalene as the concentration of adapalene with which to begin development of a topical treatment for acne'
id.at 603
dr. shroot testified that the 0.1 %_dosage was considered the optimal_dose for tolerance in a rabbit irritation study
tr.at 1841:12-17

the district_court found that` [ t ] he broad disclosure of the shroot_patents provides no motivation or suggestion to select 0.3 %_adapalene for the treatment of acne'
id.at 608-09
the correctness of these findings is not challenged by the panel_majority

the verschoore_article 1991 3
verschoore 1991 discusses a phase ii clinical trial where 0.03 % and 0.1 %_adapalene_formulations along with 0.025 % tretinoin a retinoid previously approved for topical use were tested on the faces of patients with acne
the test data showed that the 0.1 %_adapalene formulation caused increased irritation compared to the 0.03 %_formulation
dct
op.at 604
galdermas expert testified that persons of ordinary_skill in this art would view these data as suggesting that` a significant_increase in tolerability measures' would result from a further_tripling of the adapalene dose from 0.1 % to 0.3 %
tr.at 1230:15-20

the district_court found supported by the expert_testimony that` [ t ] he results of this study suggest that increasing the concentration of adapalene beyond 0.1 % would result in significantly increased irritation'
dct
op.at 604
my colleagues disagree with what they call the district_courts` inference' that verschoore 1991 and alirezai 1996 see infra taught away from a further_tripling of the dose
thus my colleagues replace the testamentary and documentary expertise that supports the district_courts findings with the expertise of the panel_majority

the alirezai article 1996 4
the district_court found that` the trend of increased irritation between the 0.03 % and 0.1 %_dosages disclosed in verschoore 1991 was later confirmed in the same dosages in aqueous gels in a publication by alirezai_et_al
entitledcomparative_study of the effectiveness and tolerance of 0.big_token__1_and_0__big_token03 percent_adapalene_gels and of 0.025 percent_tretinoin_gel in the treatment of acne
`` dct
op.at 604
the district_court found that this article disclosed that` severe burning was seen in no patients treated with the 0.03 %_adapalene but was seen in 13 % of patients treated with the 0.1 %_adapalene aqueous gel' and that` significantly higher_levels ofaverage *744 burning and itching after application were observed with the 0.1 %_formulation as compared to the 0.03 %_formulation'
id.at 605

the district_court found that` [ t ] his study conducted on the faces of acne_patients demonstrates that the tolerability of the 0.1 %_dosage was different than the 0.03 %_dosage'
id
the correctness of this finding is not challenged by my colleagues
in concluding that alirezai 1996 does not teach away from the claimed invention my colleagues ignore the district_courts finding that significantly higher_levels of burning and itching were observed upon increasing the adapalene_concentration of the formulation

the allec article 1997 5
this article entitled` skin_distribution and pharmaceutical_aspects of adapalene_gel' is discussed by the district_court as` describ [ ing ] the results of in vivo models used to select the optimal_concentration of adapalene for efficacy and safety..'
dct
op.at 605 emphasis in original
the article concludes that` [ b ] ased on these in vivo results 0.1 % was considered as the optimal_concentration of drug for adapalene gel
this choice was subsequently confirmed in clinical_trials of safety and efficacy'
id.at 606 quoting allec 1997 at s123

the district_court found that` [ a ] person of ordinary_skill in the art would have recognized these statements as a conclusion of the company that developed adapalene had determined from all the data it had on hand that 0.1 % was the optimal_concentration for acne treatment balancing efficacy and safety'
id.at 606
my colleagues concede citing allec 1997 that` the prior_art indicated that many_skilled_artisans believed at the time of invention that 0.1 % was the optimal_concentration of adapalene for the treatment of acne'
maj. op.at 742-43
my colleagues do not explain the grounds for their belief contrary to that of` many_skilled_artisans'

the verschoore_article 1997 6
this article describes phase i clinical_trials conducted by galderma on healthy subjects
the article states we carried out 13 different controlled randomized intraindividual comparison phase i studies in 339 healthy human volunteers to investigate the cutaneous safety of adapalene [ ]
the irritation potential of adapalene 0.03 % 0.1 % and 0.3 %_gels was found to be low whether tested under occlusive or nonocclusive conditions on a variety of sites face chest back and buttocks
verschoore 1997 at s104
at the trial tolmar stressed the testing by verschoore of the 0.3 %_formulation
the district_court found that` [ t ] he phase i irritation_test described in verschoore 1997 was a screening test done on uncompromised healthy skin on the back as a prelude-not a substitute-to clinical testing on the face or on patients with disease.. a skilled_person would understand that data from these phase i studies conducted on healthy skin can not be extrapolated to how the product will work in acne_patients'
dct
op.at 610
the district_court found that` verschoore 1997 demonstrates that galderma decided to pursue and obtain clinical approval for 0.1 %_adapalene
further the mention of the 0.3 %_concentration in the article demonstrates to one skilled in the art that the 0.3 %_adapalene was *745 tried and rejected as the dosage to pursue for further clinical testing'
id.at 606-07

the district_court received testimony from experts on both sides
galdermas expert testified that a skilled_person would know that patch testing on the backs of healthy volunteers is a` poor predictor' of the irritation experienced by facial_skin damaged by acne
tr.at 1244:19-1245:6
tolmars expert had previously written7 that this type of irritation_test` had failed to predict adverse reactions to skin damaged by acne or shaving on sensitive areas such as the face'
dct
op.at 610 emphasis in original
although tolmars expert stated a different opinion at trial the district_court found that the witness did not refute the views he had previously published on the non-predictive nature of patch tests on the backs of healthy individuals
id.at 622

these district_court findings are not challenged by my colleagues

the czernielewski_article 2001 8
this article summarizes the results of adapalene studies including those reported in alirezai 1996 and verschoore 1997
the article explains that the` primary objective in the development of adapalene was to create a topical agent with retinoid therapeutic effects that is considerably less irritating than topical tretinoin'
dct
op.at 640
the court states` adapalene 0.1 % became the standard concentration for subsequent adapalene formulations'
id

the district_court found that` [ t ] he czernielewski_article suggests that 0.1 %_adapalene is the optimal_dose for the treatment of acne' and that the article` does not disclose any information about any doses higher than 0.1 %_adapalene'
dct
op.at 607
my colleagues do not challenge the district_courts findings that the prior_art including czernielewski 2001 shows that 0.1 % was believed to be the optimal adapalene dose

the goldfarb article 2000 9
this article describes a study of the treatment of photodamaged_skin with 0.1 % and 0.3 %_adapalene_formulations
the authors describe both of these adapalene_concentrations as being` tolerated well'
dct
op.at 613

the district_court again received evidence and testimony from experts for both sides
galdermas expert explained the differences between photodamaged_skin and skin with acne and the different patient populations
tr.at 1290:1-1293:1
the district_court found that publications by tolmars expert showed that` one of ordinary_skill in the art would understand older skin with photodamage and actinic_keratosis to be less sensitive to the retinoid reaction compared to younger skin with acne'
id
the experts contrary testimony at trial did not refute his prior published statements
credibility findings are the particular province of the trial_judge

the district_court found that the results of this study` are not predictive of how the same drug would affect patients with acne
one of ordinary_skill in the art would know *746 that these results on photodamaged_skin should not be extrapolated to acne'
id
without either acknowledging or disputing this finding my colleagues cite goldfarb as teaching that 0.3 %_adapalene can be used for` other_conditions' without intolerable_irritability
maj. op.at 743

the euvrard article 2002 10
euvrard 2002 describes a study using 0.1 % and 0.3 %_adapalene to treat` actinic_keratosis on the hands and forearms of organ transplant patients who were presumably on immunosuppressive drugs'
dct
op.at 614
the district_court summarized the euvrard conclusion that` [ t ] olerance was excellent everywhere' and` [ t ] aking into account the good tolerance of adapalene these results encourage further studies on the use of adapalene at.. higher dosage regimens'
id

there was expert_testimony from both sides and the district_court found as with goldfarb that` [ d ] ifferences exist between the properties of facial_skin and skin on the extremities such as the hands and forearms studied in euvrard
facial skin more traditionally afflicted with acne is much more prone to irritation and often thinner than skin on extremities'
id
the district_court found that` [ b ] ased on these differences one of ordinary_skill in the art would not conclude from euvrard that adapalene 0.3 %_gel would result in the same tolerability_profile in patients with acne_vulgaris'
id

the correctness of this finding is not disputed by my colleagues
instead without acknowledging or correcting the district_courts findings my colleagues cite euvrard 2002 as teaching the use of 0.3 %_adapalene for` other_conditions' without intolerable_irritability
however the issue here is acne_vulgaris not` other_conditions'

differin 0.1 %_gel_data_sheet 1996 differinthe_r is the trademark for galdermas adapalene products
the data_sheet for 0.1 % differin cautioned against` overdosage' stating that` if the medication is applied excessively no more rapid or better results will be obtained and marked redness peeling or discomfort may occur'
dct
op.at 607
galderma cited the overdosage warning as evidence of teaching away from higher adapalene_concentrations
the district_court did not appear to give weight to the data_sheet explaining that the warning was required by law
id.at 642_n._11_(citing_21_c.f.r._¡±_201.56)

the bershad article 1999 11
this article describes a` roundtable' meeting of dermatologists
referencing the commercial 0.1 %_adapalene_product bershad 1999 states that` [ a ] lthough adapalene is commonly believed to be one of the least irritating topical_retinoids the perception of many dermatologists is that this advantage is at least partially negated by a relatively lower efficacy compared with the other_topical_retinoids'
bershad 1999 at 11
the district_court did not discuss bershad although it is cited by the panel_majority

tolmar contends that this article provides motivation to increase the concentration of adapalene
galderma responds that this article does not show any expectation or understanding that the concentration of adapalene could be increased three-fold without the predicted irritating side_effects
at trial tolmars expert *747 opined that this article suggested using doses of adapalene higher than 0.1 %
tr.at 1301:14-16
galdermas expert disagreed stating that the authors were merely discussing the characteristics of the various available acne treatments
tr.at 1301:21-23
this roundtable discussion does not render obvious the three-fold increase in dosage when so many publications cautioned against the increased irritability of higher dosages

the jamoulle article 1989 12
this article describes a study involving the application of a formulation containing 0.3 %_adapalene to hairless_rats
the district_court did not discuss this article
the panel_majority states that jamoulle 1989 teaches the use of 0.3 %_adapalene to treat acne
maj. op.at 742
however results in hairless_rats were not shown to establish dosage and tolerance on human skin much less skin sensitized by acne

ii
the` secondary considerations' commercial success
the district_court found that despite late entry into a crowded market for treatment of acne galdermas differinthe_r 0.3 %_gel quickly gained and maintained market_share despite an overall declining market
the district_court agreed with galderma that tolmar seeks to sell the 0.3 %_formulation precisely because that formulation is preferred by consumers over the 0.1 %_formulation
the court found that the availability of cheaper generic 0.1 %_adapalene after the expiration of the shroot_patents did not appear to have affected consumer demand for the differinthe_r 0.3 %_product whose market_share and revenue were not explained by promotional activity which had actually decreased
clear_error has not been shown in these findings

my colleagues discount the factor of commercial_success arguing that the entry of 0.3 %_adapalene_products by tolmar or others had previously been blocked by the shroot_patents
maj. op.at 740
however the evidence in the district_court was that the 0.3 %_product was successful against the 0.1 %_product and other acne medications
the district_court did not err in including evidence of commercial_success in its evaluation of the question of obviousness

teaching away
the district_court found based on the prior_art and the expert_testimony presented by both sides that the evidence as a whole taught away from increasing the concentration of adapalene above 0.1 %
the district_court found that` [ t ] he increased irritation observed in [ verschoore 1991 and alirezai 1996 ] when tripling the concentration of adapalene from 0.03 % to 0.1 % effectively taught away from again tripling the concentration from 0.1 % to 0.3 % given the potential for increased side_effects'
dct
op.at 641-42

the district_court also found that allec 1997 verschoore 1997 and czernielewski 2001` would also have taught away from tripling the concentration of adapalene from 0.1 % to 0.3 % which would have been a significant deviation from the then-understood optimal_concentration'
dct
op.at 642
the court found that the experience of those skilled with other_topical_retinoids that had been approved for human use such as tretinoin and tazarotene further taught away from tripling of the concentration of adapalene
the court *748 explained that both tretinoin and tazarotene faced tolerability problems which required the manufacturers to decrease their concentration in products for the treatment of acne
clear_error has not been shown in these findings

unexpected_results
the district_court found that it was unexpected that the tolerability_profile of 0.3 %_adapalene was not statistically different from that of 0.1 %_adapalene
tolmar had argued-and repeats on appeal-that at most the tolerability_profile of 0.3 %_adapalene represents a difference in degree not in kind
however based on expert_testimony from both sides the district_court found that` [ w ] hereas the prior_art suggested a dose-dependent clinically meaningful increase in side_effects would result from increasing the concentration of adapalene from 0.03 % to 0.1 % the claimed inventions achieved a difference in kind by discontinuing that trend'
id.at 643

the district_court explained that differences in degree occur when the invention is merely a continuation of a trend previously described in the prior_art
id.at n. 14 citing in re huang 100_f.3d_135_(fed.cir.1996) ; iron_grip_barbell_co. inc. v. usa_sports inc. 392_f.3d_1317 1323 fed.cir.2004
here the prior_art showed a trend to increased adverse side_effects with increased concentration while galdermas products violated that trend
this was a difference in kind not in degree

clear_error has not been shown in these findings all of which are discounted or ignored by the panel_majority

iii
the decision at trial
the district_court considered all of the evidence and argument and concluded that the claims to the 0.3 %_adapalene_formulations had not been proved invalid by clear and convincing_evidence
the court acknowledged tolmars argument that obviousness should be presumed tolmar argued that` because 0.3 %_adapalene falls within the 0.01 % -1.0 % range previously disclosed in galdermas shroot_patents the claimed inventions are prima_facie obvious' and that`evidence of secondary_considerations simply can not overcome the presumption of obviousness'
dct
op.at 637 quoting tolmars trial brief
the district_court unlike the panel_majority correctly recognized that a prima_facie showing is not a presumption of obviousness and does not change the placement of the burden of proof
the district_court recited recently the federal_circuit rejected such an approach to obviousness in the context of litigation
the federal_circuit noted that the supreme_court` has never spoken in terms of a legally rebuttable presumption with respect to obviousness ;' nor has it provided any` indication that it believes the burden of persuasion should shift to the patentee at [ any ] point to prove nonobviousness'
dct
op.at 637-638 quoting in re cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride litigation 676_f.3d_1063 1078 fed.cir.2012

the district_court correctly explained that` the proper analysis of obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 requires thatall evidence relevant to obviousness or nonobviousness be considered and be considered collectively without resort to presumptions of prima_facie obviousness or burden-shifting'
dct
op.at 638 quoting cyclobenzaprine 676 f.3d at 1078
this is the correct_standard established in graham v. john deere and reiterated consistently and exhaustively

the dispositive findings in this case viz
the content of the prior_art whether the *749 prior_art taught away whether the invention produced unexpected_results and whether there was commercial_success involve factual inquires that must be accepted on appeal unless clearly erroneous
see in re applied materials inc. 692_f.3d_1289 1294 fed.cir.2012` obviousness is a question of law with several underlying factual inquiries including what a reference teaches whether a reference teaches away and whether there is commercial_success'
( citing graham v. john_deere_co. of kan. city 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
clear_error has not been shown in the district_courts findings
instead on highly selective snippets of the information that was before the district_court my colleagues simply make their own_findings

the burden of overcoming a district_courts factual_findings is heavy
see anderson v. bessemer_city n.c. 470_u.s._564 574 105_s.ct._1504 84_l.ed.2d_518_(1985)` where there are two permissible views of the evidence the factfinders choice between them can not not be clearly erroneous`
based on the expert_testimony the documentary_evidence and the factual_findings of teaching away unexpected_results and commercial_success the district_court concluded that tolmar failed to prove by clear and convincing_evidence that the inventions of the patents-in-suit would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the field of the inventions
for the reasons discussed by the district_court the judgment requires affirmance

tolmar was required to provide clear and convincing_evidence that the selection of 0.3 % from within the broad_range in the prior_art was obvious in view of the entirety of the evidence
the evidence at trial was that the increase in adapalene_concentration was viewed skeptically and that the combination of efficacy and safety of the 0.3 %_dose was unexpected to the experts
the experts at trial agreed that the beneficial combination of properties of the 0.3 %_dose could not have been predicted in advance-indeed the opposite was predicted
the resultant product was commercially successful despite the cheaper prior product at lower dosage

the panel_majority mentions but does not apply the presumption of validity
my colleagues hold that for inventions` where there is a range disclosed in the prior_art and the claimed invention falls within that range' the burden falls upon the patentee to support patentability
maj. op.at 744
this is not just a shift in the burden of production ; the majority never requires that tolmar meet its burden of persuasion
instead once tolmar had demonstrated that the invention fell within a broad_range disclosed in the prior_art according to the panel_majority tolmar met its evidentiary burden
my colleagues do not require that the prior_art provide some reason for selection of the patented embodiment
instead the court places the burden of` rebuttal' on the patentee and limits rebuttal to the` secondary_considerations'

the panel_majority also makes creative new rules ruling that patentability is negated` where the modification of the percentage is within the capabilities of one skilled in the art at the time'
maj. op.at 746
the holding that since` skilled_artisans were capable of adjusting the percentage' the product containing 300 % more active_ingredient` although unexpected' in properties id. is unpatentable is new and incorrect law
a skilled_artisan will nearly always be` capable' of adjusting a percentage of an ingredient ; this fact does not render unexpected_results not probative of unobviousness

thus the court places new obstacles in the path of improvement_patents a change of law that is particularly pernicious in the arts where small differences may have *750 large consequences or benefits
this rule is of further mischief now that the nation has adopted a first-to-file law with its pressures for early filing possibly before all embodiments have been fully explored

the district_court applied the correct law to a vast_body of evidence most of which is not discussed by the panel_majority
the district_court properly applied statute and precedent
from my colleagues inappropriate rulings i respectfully dissent
