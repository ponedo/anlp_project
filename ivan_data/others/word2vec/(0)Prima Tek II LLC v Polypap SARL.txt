we reverse because we find the asserted_claims of the856 and532_patent s invalid as anticipated and dismiss the cross-appeal as moot

background
i. prima_tek and polypap are competitors in the floral products market
polypap is a french business that sells a product in the united states called the bouquett o` the accused product'
the accused product is a semicircular piece of plastic that can be formed into a disposable device for holding floral arrangements
on march_29,_1999 prima_tek filed suit against polypap for infringement of inter *1286 alia claim 15 of the856_patent and claim 9 of the532_patent
the district_court granted summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of polypap which decision was appealed to this court
prima_tek_ii l.l.c
v. polypap s.a.r.l. 318_f.3d_1143 1145 fed.cir.2003
we held that the district_court had used an incorrect claim_construction vacated the decision and remanded for further proceedings
id.at 1154
we specifically held that the phrase` floral_holding_material having an upper_end a lower_end and an outer_peripheral_surface the floral_holding_material being constructed of a material capable of receiving a portion of the floral_grouping and supporting the floral_grouping without any pot_means' must be given its ordinary_meaning and is not limited to floral_foam or soil
id.at 1149 1152

after a bench trial the district_court held the asserted_claims of the patents not invalid and infringed by polypap and accordingly enjoined polypap from making using or selling the accused product or instructing others in its use
the district_court rejected prima_teks claims that polypap was liable for induced and contributory_infringement
the district_court also rejected polypaps claim that prima_tek engaged in inequitable conduct in the prosecution of the patents
polypap appeals and prima_tek cross-appeals from the district_courts judgment of no induced or contributory_infringement

ii
the asserted_claims describe an assembly and method for displaying a floral_grouping
they generally describe a floral_grouping in which flower stems are inserted into floral_foam the foam wrapped in a sheet of material and tied near the top
claim 15 of the856_patent includes limitations for inter_alia a` floral_holding_material' the absence of any` pot_means' and a` crimped_portion in the sheet of material' having` at least one overlapping fold
`` 1 *big_token__1287_claim_9__big_token of the532_patent includes limitations for inter_alia` providing a floral_holding_material' the absence of any` pot_means' and` disposing banding_means about the sheet of material.. causing the banding_means to press a portion of the sheet of material against the outer_surface of the floral_holding_material
`` 2

this case presents the question of whether the asserted_claims are invalid as anticipated
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
in considering questions of anticipation we are mindful that if an invalid patent is issued competitors may be deterred from challenging it by the substantial cost of litigation
even if a successful challenge is brought competition may be suppressed during the pendency of the litigation
the risk of antitrust liability or litigation sanctions may deter some from seeking to secure or enforce invalid_patents but our patent system depends primarily on the patent and trademark offices` ptos' care in screening out invalid_patents during prosecution

anticipation is ultimately a question of fact but also depends on proper claim_construction-a legal issue
we review the district_courts claim_construction without deference and its factual determinations for clear error
golden blount inc. v. robert h. peterson co. 365_f.3d_1054 1058 fed.cir.2004
here extensive prior art exists regarding products and methods for displaying floral_groupings and the district_court considered prior art stretching back over a century
it appears likely that the asserted_claims are anticipated by the 1899 bertels reference but for simplicity we address only the more recent charrin_reference which the district_court found to be` substantially identical' to the much earlier bertels reference
316 f.supp.2d at 707
under the appropriate standard the charrin prior art reference which was before the examiner during prosecution of the532_patent clearly anticipates the asserted_claims of the patents in suit
the charrin_reference is a published french patent application naming andre_charrin as the applicant and inventor
in one embodiment flowers *1288 are inserted into a mass of wetted moss about which a cover made of waterproof material is wrapped.3 the cover is tied at the top by way of a cord passing through holes in the cover which is then tightened

prima_tek agrees that the charrin_reference anticipates but for three limitations the` without any pot_means' limitation the alleged requirement that the floral_holding_material hold its shape and the crimping limitation found only in claim 15 of the856_patent

we first consider the meaning of the claim term` pot_means' in order to determine whether the` without any pot_means' limitation was satisfied by the charrin_reference
we did not construe this claim_language in our prior opinion
the district_court defined the` [ m ] aterial capable of receiving a portion of the floral_grouping and supporting the floral_grouping without any pot_means' limitation as` any material that can function as floral_holding_material which supports the floral_grouping without a closed bottom_receptacle such as a flower_pot vase etc'
316 f.supp.2d at 698
thus the district_court appears to have construed` pot_means' as` a closed bottom_receptacle such as a flower_pot vase etc'
the parties did not contest this construction in their briefs but at oral argument each proposed a different construction
polypap urged a broader_construction of` a shell-like structure that supports a grouping of flowers'
prima_tek urged an even broader_construction of` a container or anything that serves like a container to hold the floral_holding_material in place'
the specifications do not define pot_means other than to give the example of a flower_pot
'856_patent col. 3 ii
48-49 ;532 col. 3 ii
50-51

when construing claims we look first` to the words of the claims themselves.. to define the scope of the patented invention'
vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996
`` [ w ] ords in a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning' unless some` special definition of the term is clearly stated in the patent specification or file history'
id
we may consult with dictionaries` in determining the ordinary and customary meanings of claim terms'
tex
digital sys. inc. v. telegenix inc. 308_f.3d_1193 1202 fed.cir.2002
`` pot' is defined as a` rounded metal or earthen container of varying size used chiefly for domestic purposes'
websters third new international dictionary 1774 2002
the charrin_reference clearly satisfies the` without a pot_means' limitation
it does not use a metal or earthenware container
prima_teks argument that the wire or string tied around the moss of the charrin_reference is a pot_means is without merit

the district_court appears to have construed the term` floral_holding_material' to require that the material hold its predetermined_shape
as required by our previous opinion 318 f.3d at 1152 the district_court construed` floral_holding_material' in the context of its infringement determination to mean` [ h ] as an upper_end a lower_end and an outer_peripheral_surface and is constructed of a material capable of receiving a portion of the floral_grouping and supporting the floral_grouping without any pot_means' 316 f.supp.2d at 697-98
*1289 however in its anticipation analysis the district_court appeared to change its claim_construction to distinguish the charrin_reference from the patents by concluding that a necessary_element of the term` floral_holding_material' is` that the material is [ ] capable of holding its predetermined_shape'
316 f.supp.2d at 706.4 when this court previously construed` floral_holding_material' we held that the term should be given its ordinary_meaning and is not limited to floral_foam or soil
we did not include in that construction a requirement that the material be capable of holding its predetermined_shape
318 f.3d at 1149-52
the district_court erred in adding such a limitation

prima_tek attempts to defend the district_courts construction by pointing to claim_language requiring that the floral_holding_material have an upper_end a lower_end and an outer_peripheral_surface
this language of course includes virtually anything that is capable of holding flowers and does not require that the material hold its predetermined_shape
contrary to prima_teks argument the specification does not suggest otherwise
the specification reads the floral holding means 18 may be the type of material commonly referred to in the art as floral_foam or oasis tm or may be soil or artificial soil or other earth composition so long as the material is capable of holding its predetermined_shape and capable of receiving and supporting the floral_grouping 26 without any additional pot_means
'856_patent col. 3 ii
50-56 ;532_patent col. 3 ii
52-57 emphasis added
this language which appears as part of the description of the preferred embodiments merely describes the preferred embodiment and does not define floral_holding_material to include an undefined limitation not found in the ordinary_meaning of the claim_language
we have repeatedly made clear that limitations can not be imported from the specification into the claims
e.g. comark communications inc. v. harris corp. 156_f.3d_1182 1186 fed.cir.1998
`` [ t ] he claims of the patent will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction'
liebel-flarsheim co. v. medrad inc. 358_f.3d_898 906 fed.cir.2004 internal quotations and citation omitted
the language of the specifications here evinces no such clear intention

finally the district_court held that the charrin_reference does not include the crimping and overlapping fold limitations of claim 15 of the856_patent
the charrin_reference discloses the tying of a sheet of material with a string laced through holes in the sheet
the district_court found that polypap offered` no evidence that a crimped_portion is formed in the sheet of material' and therefore held the crimping limitation not present in charrin
316 f.supp.2d at 707
the appellant concedes that the charrin_reference does not include a crimping limitation but argues that the limitation is inherent
we have previously held that` a prior art reference may anticipate when the claim limitation or limitations not expressly found in that reference are nonetheless inherent in it'
mehl/biophile int l corp. v. milgraum 192_f.3d_1362 1365 fed.cir.1999
inherent anticipation does not require an appreciation of the inherent limitation by those of skill in the art before the critical *1290 date of the patents in issue
schering corp. v. geneva pharms. inc. 339_f.3d_1373 1377 fed.cir.2003

here the undisputed evidence shows that crimping and overlapping folds are inherent to the charrin_reference
the drawings of the charrin_reference disclose a sheet of material containing a number of holes through which a string is laced
one figure shows the sheet of material tied up around a flower_pot by the string such that the material has overlapping folds and is crimped.5 another figure shows the material lying flat with the string loose and a block of moss sitting on the sheet of material
the charrin_reference itself shows that crimping is inherent
moreover philippe_charrin provided testimony that when tightened the string would create overlapping folds in the sheet of material.6 prima_tek presented no rebuttal evidence
the undisputed record shows that the crimping means was inherent in charrin.7

?
*1291 under these circumstances we conclude that claim 15 of the856_patent and claim 9 of the532_patent were anticipated by charrin and that claim 15 of the856_patent and claim 9 of the532_patent are invalid

conclusion
claim 15 of the856_patent and claim 9 of the532_patent are invalid as anticipated by the charrin_reference
for this reason the judgment of the district_court is reversed
the cross-appeal is dismissed as moot since there can be no contributory or induced infringement of invalid patent claims

the parties dispute the proper translation of the french word` mousse' as found in the charrin_reference
prima_tek contends and district_court held that the word should be translated as` moss'
polypap contends that the word should be translated as` foam'
in light of our disposition this controversy need not be addressed for we conclude that the asserted_claims of the532 and856_patent s are invalid even assuming that` mousse' is properly translated as` moss' as prima_tek contends
