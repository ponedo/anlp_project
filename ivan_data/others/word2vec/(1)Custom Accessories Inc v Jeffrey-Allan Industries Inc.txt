synopsis
patent holder brought infringement action
the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois james b. moran j. determined that claims of patent for mud flap and splash_guard_assemblies were obvious and invalid
holder appealed
the court of appeals edward s. smith circuit_judge held that 1 old or unpatentable nature of each element in claimed invention for mud flap or splash_guard_assemblies did not determine that invention was obvious and that patent was invalid ; 2 district_court was required to consider objective_evidence of nonobviousness which included evidence of copying and commercial_success ; and 3 district_court failed to make sufficient required findings with regard to scope and content of prior_art differences between prior_art and claims at issue level of ordinary_skill in art and objective_evidence of nonobviousness

vacated and remanded

* opinion
edward s. smith circuit_judge
this is an appeal by custom_accessories inc. custom from a judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois eastern division holding invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103_claims_1 and 6 of united states patent no._4264,083 the083_patent
we vacate and remand

*957 background
the facts recited in this opinion unless otherwise indicated are either uncontested by the parties or are findings of the district_court not shown to have been clearly erroneous

1
the technology
mud flap or splash_guard_assemblies are commonly used on motor_vehicles to prevent damage to the frame due to pebbles salt mud and other debris thrown from the vehicle path by rotating wheels
they are placed in close proximity to a wheel and occupy a rearward position relative to the primary direction of travel of the motor_vehicle
the assembly usually includes a splash intercepting body_portion such as a flat resilient flap or a rigid metallic plate of light construction anchored by a fastener to a fender area of the vehicle

2
the patent
the083_patent was issued on april_28,_1981 to matthew et al. and was assigned to custom
a reissue patent application was filed on june_23,_1981 in the name of the original inventors
on february 19 1982 pretty products inc. filed a request for reexamination in light of nine references not considered during prosecution
on june_3,_1982 the united states patent and trademark office pto merged the reissue_application with the reexamination proceeding
custom then expressly abandoned the reissue_application on june_17,_1982
original claims 1_and_6 were amended during and ultimately survived reexamination
a reexamination certificate including those claims was issued on march_22,_1983

claim 1 reads as follows 1
a splash_guard or mud flap assembly for attachment to the fender of a motor_vehicle comprising a flexible splash-intercepting body_portion resilient self-sustaining anchoring_means for supporting the body_portion and being adapted to be snugly engaged along the fender of a motor_vehicle for securing the body_portion in a splash-intercepting position thereon said anchoring_means including a front_wall and a back_wall resiliently integrally joined along one side in substantial overlying relation to one another and converging in the direction of the free_ends thereof the free_ends of said walls being resiliently separable a distance to enable the anchoring_means to be snugly frictionally engaged on a motor_vehicle_fender the resiliency of the anchoring_means being such that the front_wall and the back_wall thereof provide substantially the total gripping force for maintaining the anchoring_means on a motor_vehicle_fender while providing a rigid support base for the splash-intercepting body_portion of the splash_guard and an outwardly extending pin-like_member carried on the front_wall of the resilient anchoring_means in spaced inward relation to the free_ends of said walls of the anchoring_means for engaging and retaining said body_portion on the anchoring_means said pin-like_member being provided with locking_means for securing and maintaining the splash-intercepting body_portion on the anchoring_means said locking_means being characterized in that it overlies and is in contact with a sufficient_area of the splash-intercepting body_portion to resist any forces tending to dislodge said body_portion from the pin-like_member

claim 6 recites a splash_guard or mud flap assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein the pin-like_member of the anchoring_means is provided with external threads for receiving a nut-like retaining member for securing and maintaining the splash-intercepting body_portion on the anchoring_means said nut-like retaining member being characterized in that the base of the nut-like retaining member overlies and is in contact with a sufficient_area of said body_portion to resist any forces tending to dislodge the body from the pin-like_member

district_court proceeding
custom filed suit in the district_court alleging infringement by appellee jeffrey- *958 allan_industries inc. jeffrey-allan
jeffrey-allan denied infringement
it also raised as affirmative defenses and counterclaimed that claims 1_and_6 were invalid on the grounds of obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 improper inventorship under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 f and overclaiming under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112

the district_court judge entered judgment for jeffrey-allan for the reasons contained in a july_26,_1985` memorandum and order' that constituted the courts findings of fact and conclusions of law
the district_court found claims 1_and_6 of the083_patent invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103,1 but did not adjudicate any other issue
the memorandum and order does state however that` [ d ] efendant does not seriously contend that its splash_guard_assembly does not infringe'

issue
whether the district_court erred in holding that claims 1_and_6 of the083_patent are invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

opinion
section 103_of_35 u.s.c
precludes a patent grant
if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains
* * * though the ultimate question is one of law a determination of obviousness under section 103 is based on these factual inquiries set forth in graham v. john_deere_co.:2 a the scope and content of the prior_art ; b the differences between the prior_art and the claims at issue ; c the level of ordinary_skill in the art ; and d objective_evidence of nonobviousness.3

under graham a district_court makes proper fact findings on those four inquiries and then assesses the ultimate legal question of nonobviousness
thus given the scope and content of the prior_art the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art the level of ordinary_skill in the art and the existence of commercial_success and any other objective considerations of nonobviousness the district_court determines whether the claimed invention would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the appropriate art at the time the invention was made

at the conclusion of its 7 1/2 page memorandum and order the district_court for the first time cites graham stating this court concludes in accordance with the teachings of graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) ; dual_mfg
& engineering inc. v. burris industries inc. 619_f.2d_660_(7th_cir.) en banc cert
denied 449_u.s._870 101_s.ct._208 66_l.ed.2d_90_(1980) and republic_industries inc. v. schlage_lock_co. 592_f.2d_963_(7th_cir.1979) that the use of that anchoring_means rather than another in an old_combination was in the circumstances of this case obvious within the meaning of section 103
that fleeting reference to graham does not convince us that the district_court in fact properly analyzed obviousness using the graham_analysis
indeed custom has persuaded us to the contrary
that graham was not properly applied is evidenced *959 by the district_court 1 improperly focusing on` a combination of old_elements' ; 2 ignoring objective_evidence of nonobviousness ; 3 paying lip service to the presumption of validity ; and 4 failing to make sufficient_graham_findings

a
improperly focusing on a combination of old elements
in assessing the patentability of customs device the district_courts memorandum and order refers to` a combination of old_elements' which` is not necessarily an invention' but is entitled to patent protection if the combination` causes a new and useful_result'
though it perceives one of the elements the protruding pin in the anchoring_means as possibly novel it states a u-clip with a locked pin surely was not itself patentable as an independent invention
indeed the plaintiff cancelled claims limited to the anchoring_means during reexamination when they were rejected as obvious
* * * such an approach is improper

the dispositive question is not whether the claimed device is an` invention' ; rather it is whether the invention satisfies the standards of patentability
35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 100-103
to suggest that customs new combination` is not necessarily an invention' or otherwise to require some concept of` inventiveness' or` flash of genius' for patentability would improperly misplace the focus of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103.4

that each element in a claimed invention is old or unpatentable does not determine the nonobviousness of the claimed invention as a whole
`` there is no basis in the law * * * for treating combinations of old_elements differently in determining patentability
`` 5 as stated in stratoflex:6

the reference to a` combination patent' is equally without support in the statute
there is no warrant for judicial classification of patents whether into` combination' patents and some other unnamed and undefined class or otherwise
nor is there warrant for differing treatment or consideration of patents based on a judicially devised label
reference to` combination' patents is moreover meaningless
virtually all patents are` combination_patents' if by that label one intends to describe patents having claims to inventions formed of a combination of elements
it is difficult to visualize at least in the mechanical-structural arts a` non-combination' invention i.e. an invention consisting of a single element
* * * [ emphasis in original ]
casting an invention as` a combination of old_elements' leads improperly to an analysis of the claimed invention by the parts not by the whole
that is what seems to have happened here
the critical inquiry is whether`there is something in the prior_art as a whole to suggest the desirability and thus the obviousness of making the combination
`` 7

a traditional problem with focusing on a patent as a` combination of old_elements' is the attendant notion that patentability is undeserving without some` synergistic' or` different' effect
here the district_court spoke of the need for` a new and useful_result'
such tests for patentability have been soundly rejected by this court.8 *960 though synergism is relevant when present its` absence has no place in evaluating the evidence on obviousness
`` 9

the district_courts citation to dual_manufacturing10 together with graham v. john_deere supports our conclusion that the district_court was misled by improper` combination' notions
dual_manufacturing expressly adopts the type of rationale regarding` combination_patents' and synergism that this court has expressly rejected and only serves to confuse the real test of obviousness prescribed by the 1952 patent act
though republic_industries inc. v. schlage_lock_co.,11 also cited by the district_court is more in tune with federal circuit precedent on combination_patents and synergism the possibility exists that the district_court gave more credence to dual_manufacturing because it was decided in banc and subsequent to republic_industries

b
ignoring objective_evidence of nonobviousness
the district_court found that customs` assembly was an improvement as persuasively evidenced by its adoption by competitors
`` 12 though` not a major breakthrough' stated the court` it was a better mousetrap than those on the market' and` [ o ] thers have adopted that design so that it has become a commonly sold configuration thus providing support for a contention of commercial_success although plaintiff has had virtually no success in persuading its competition to take licenses'
after saying that however the district_court seemed to ignore the concrete evidence of copying and commercial_success
failure to consider such_evidence is clearly error

under graham objective_evidence of nonobviousness includes commercial_success longfelt but unresolved need failure of others and copying.13 when present such objective_evidence must be considered.14 it can be the most probative evidence of nonobviousness in the record and enables the district_court to avert the trap of hindsight.15 on the other hand the absence of objective_evidence does not preclude a holding of nonobviousness because such_evidence is not a requirement for patentability.16 as stated in medtronic inc. v. intermedics inc.,17 the absence of objective_evidence` is a neutral factor'

the district_courts failure to consider objective_evidence was probably fueled by the two cases it cited together with graham
both dual_manufacturing and republic_industries mistreat the importance of objective_evidence such as commercial_success
they incorrectly state that such *961 objective criteria` without invention will not make patentability
`` 18

c. paying lip service to the presumption of validity
a patent is presumed valid
35 u.s.c.¡± 282
indeed each claim of a patent is presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims
id
the burden is on the party asserting invalidity to prove the invalidity of each claim here claims 1_and_6 with facts supported by clear and convincing_evidence.19

though the district_court stated that the presumption operates to` shift the burden of proof' the memorandum and order does not indicate a recognition by the district_court that the burden is by clear and convincing_evidence
moreover the memorandum and order occasionally suggests that the district_court may have incorrectly placed the burden on the patentee to establish validity
for example it states` this court finds unpersuasive plaintiffs contention that bedford does not anticipate * * *
`` 20

nor did the district_court give any credence to the pto reexamination proceeding which upheld the validity of claims 1_and_6 despite the presence of much the same art as was presented before the district_court
in interconnect_planning_corp. v. feil,21 this court stated that an examiners decision on an original or reissue_application is` evidence the court must consider in determining whether the party asserting invalidity has met its statutory burden by clear and convincing_evidence' and that upon reissue the burden of proving invalidity was` made heavier
`` 22

d. failing to make sufficient graham findings
the amount and specificity of findings needed are determinations to be made on a case-by-case basis.23` [ w ] e must be convinced from the opinion that the district_court actually applied graham and must be presented with enough express and necessarily implied findings to know the basis of the trial courts opinion
`` 24 certainly when significant legal errors are reflected in the opinion as here which themselves shed doubt on the district_courts use of graham the need for findings becomes greater and their absence rises to the level of error.25

in this case the failure of the district_court to make sufficient_graham_findings further supports our conclusion that graham was not in fact properly applied
the findings were insufficient in at least three regards

( 1 scope and content of prior_art/differences between prior_art and claimed invention
the memorandum and order briefly discusses as prior_art united states patents to bedford jr. and to wootton a line of *962` au-ve-co' devices a tinnerman parts catalogue and a rubber queen assembly
however the memorandum and order does not make clear which reference/devices references or combination of references provides the basis for determining obviousness
it is also not clear what teachings are relied on from each reference and how each reference differs from the claimed invention

some differences were found but improperly considered by the district_court
for one the district_court did not find a teaching in any reference of a pin protruding or extending from a clip but dismissed that difference by stating that the au-ve-co unit and the wootton patent disclosed an anchoring_means in which a bolt threaded into the clip rather than a pin projecting from the clip does not dilute the force of the disclosure
indeed the idea taken to dechant could have ended up in commercial production in that form
* * * it is unclear what is meant by` does not dilute the force of the disclosure'
clearly the district_court identified a difference between the claimed invention and the prior_art-the protruding pin
before deeming the claimed invention obvious the district_court would have to find some suggestion in the references for using an` outwardly extending pin-like_member' as required by the claims

the district_court also stated what was brought to him [ dechant who designed the fastener ] was the idea reduced to practice in a primitive form of an anchoring_means in a splash_guard_assembly which used a pin attached as part of a clip and projecting through the splash_guard
there was no reason in light of the conception that the attachment to the clip could not have been by screwing a bolt into threads [ like in the prior_art ] * * *
that approach appears inappropriately to perceive an element of the claimed invention i.e. a pin as part of the clip protruding through the splash_guard broadly as an` idea' or` conception' screwing a bolt into threads that the district_court viewed as being old in the prior_art
such treatment emasculates a real difference in this case between the claimed invention and the prior_art

( 2 level of ordinary skill
the graham_analysis includes a factual determination of the level of ordinary_skill in the art
without that information a district_court can not properly assess obviousness because the critical question is whether a claimed invention would have been obvious at the time it was made to one with ordinary_skill in the art.26 the important consideration is` the need to adhere to the statute i.e. to hold that an invention would or would not have been obvious as a whole when it was made to a person ofordinary_skill in the art'-not to the judge or to a layman or to those skilled in remote arts or to geniuses in the art
`` 27

the person of ordinary_skill is a hypothetical person who is presumed to be aware of all the pertinent prior_art.28 the actual inventors skill is not determinative.29 factors that may be considered in determining level of skill include type of problems encountered in art ; prior_art solutions to those problems ; rapidity with which innovations are made ; sophistication of the technology ; and educational level of active workers in the field.30 not all such *963 factors may be present in every case and one or more of them may predominate.31

in appropriate cases we have noted a district_courts failure to make a specific or correct finding on level of skill without the consequence of reversal.32 in those instances however it was not shown that the failure to make a finding or an incorrect finding on level of skill influenced the ultimate conclusion under section 103 and hence constituted reversible error

in the present_case we do not reverse or vacate solely because of a failure to make the level of skill finding
we merely consider the district_courts failure to make that and other graham findings as evidence that graham was not in fact applied.33

( 3 objective_evidence of nonobviousness
it is difficult for us to tell from the district_courts discussion of commercial_success see discussion at section b supra whether there was a finding of commercial_success and if so whether there was` nexus' between the commercial_success and the claimed invention
such nexus the existence of which jeffrey-allan on appeal disputes is needed if commercial_success is to be considered.34

conclusion
if on review of a determination of obviousness an appellant shows that the district_court incorrectly applied the law we will not reverse i.e. hold that defendant below failed to prove obviousness unless appellant also convinces us that a proper application of the law to the facts of record would change the result.35 sometimes however an appellant will convince us that the law was incorrectly applied but there are inadequate_findings by the district_court to enable us to determine independently whether defendant below did or did not prove that the invention would have been obvious
that has happened here because as explained above there are inadequate_findings in a number of regards
in such circumstances rather than find material facts ourselves we must remand to allow the district_court to do so
as stated in icicle_seafoods inc. v. worthington:36

if the court of appeals believed that the district_court had failed to make findings of fact essential to a proper resolution of the legal question it should have remanded to the district_court to make those findings
if it was of the view that the findings of the district_court were` clearly erroneous' within the meaning of rule 52 a it could have set them aside on that basis
if it believed that the district_courts factual_findings were unassailable but that the proper rule of law was misapplied to those findings it could have reversed the district_courts judgment
but it should not simply have made factual_findings on its own
hence we vacate the judgment of the district_court and remand for further proceedings
the district_court based on the record before it and in light of the guidance provided herein is instructed 1 to make proper findings underlying a determination under section 103 sufficient for us to review its judgment and to assure us that the graham test was in fact applied and 2 to *964 determine whether defendant below has carried its burden of showing by clear and convincing_evidence that the claimed invention would have been obvious under section 103
if the district_court deems it appropriate it may elicit new evidence

on remand the district_court should also address the other issues presented e.g.` overclaiming' the section 102 f defense and infringement and should enter judgment accordingly
that way we need not remand the case should we reverse the district_court in a future appeal on e.g. a determination of obviousness
too often district_courts resolve only one of a number of issues presented and when reversed on that issue are forced to retry the remainder of the case
such retrial is on balance an inefficient use of the judicial process
it can for example involve duplication of much of the testimony and evidence presented at the first trial.37

vacated and remanded
