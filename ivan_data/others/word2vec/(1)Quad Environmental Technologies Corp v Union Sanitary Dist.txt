opinion
pauline newman circuit_judge
quad environmental technologies corporation appeals the summary_judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of california holding all *872 the claims of the patent in suit invalid on the basis of obviousness.1 the district_court did not reach the issues of infringement and inequitable conduct deeming them mooted

we conclude that summary_judgment was improvidently granted based on errors of law
since material disputed facts require resolution we reverse the grant of summary_judgment and remand for trial

summary judgment
the process of summary_judgment is a salutary means of avoiding an unnecessary trial when the movant is clearly entitled to judgment as a matter of law
fed.r.civ.p
56 c ; anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 247 106_s.ct._2505 2509-10 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986) ; celotex corp. v. catrett 477_u.s._317 322-23 106_s.ct._2548 2552 91_l.ed.2d_265_(1986)
the burden of establishing entitlement to summary disposition is with the movant with due consideration to the presumptions and burdens that characterize the issues in dispute

the reviewing court must determine for itself whether the requirements for summary_judgment were met
id

when the issue is patent invalidity due to obviousness 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 the movant must overcome the statutory presumption of validity 35 u.s.c.¡± 282 by proving obviousness by clear and convincing evidence based on undisputed facts
all factual inferences must be drawn in favor of the opponent of the motion

although patent issues are as amenable to summary resolution as other matters when material facts are disputed and testimonial documentary and expert evidence are needed for their resolution summary adjudication is not indicated
such is here the case

the reexamination proceedings
united states patent no._4238,461 the461_patent was issued december 9 1980 to inventor egbert devries and assigned to quad
the461_patent describes and claims a method of removing odors from dry_waste_gas_streams
quad requested reexamination of the461_patent and concurrently of an earlier-filed devries patent on waste treatment u.s. patent no._4125,589 issued november 14 1978 the589_patent
the589_patent describes and claims a method of removing odors from wet waste gas streams

the patent_examiner granted quads reexamination request as to the461_patent and denied the request as to the589_patent
by granting reexamination the examiner determined in the words of 35 u.s.c.¡± 303 that` a substantial_new_question of patentability' was raised.2 the reexamination_order cited certain new references under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the order also stated that the589_patent was a reference against the461 invention under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a 3 and raised new questions under` both 35_u.s.c._103 and the judicially-created doctrine of obvious [ type ] double_patenting'

quad responded to the reexamination_order pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 304,4 and *873 filed proposed amendments to some of the claims to distinguish the newly cited references
quad argued that the461 invention was not obvious from the teachings of the589_patent pointing out technological differences
in order to` obviate' the issue of obvious-type_double_patenting quad filed a terminal_disclaimer disclaiming that portion of the term of the461_patent which extended beyond the expiration date of the589_patent5

the examiner held that the terminal_disclaimer resolved the issue of obvious-type_double_patenting
the examiner also stated that he had been in error in deeming the589_patent to be prior_art against the461 invention since the589_patent was filed by the same inventor less than one year before the filing_date of the461_patent
see in re katz 687_f.2d_450 454 215_uspq_14 17 ccpa 1982
the589_patent thus had no further role in the reexamination
the merits of the question of obviousness of the461 claimed invention over the589_patents teachings were not decided during the reexamination_proceedings

after additional exchanges between the applicant and the examiner not here relevant all objections were withdrawn
one claim of the461_patent was cancelled and other claims were added or amended
a reexamination certificate was issued affirming patentability of the claims in the form resulting from reexamination

the district court proceedings
quad sued union_sanitary_district and its supplier a.p.t. inc. d/b/a calvert_environmental inc. collectively herein` union' for direct and contributory_infringement of the reexamined461_patent
the district_court granted unions motion for summary_judgment of invalidity for obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 b /103
the motion was based on quads pre-trial stipulation that the invention of the589_patent was in commercial_use at the montfort packing company plant in 1977 and that this process` the montfort_process' was prior_art against the461_patent

the district_court did not review whether the montfort_process made obvious the invention of the461_patent
the court held instead that quads filing of the terminal_disclaimer to obviate the double_patenting_issue was an admission that the461_patent claims were obvious in view of the589_patent disclosure
the court thus held that quad was estopped from arguing that the461 claims were unobvious in view of the montfort_process which quad had admitted embodied the invention of the589_patent

the court erred in law reflecting an apparent misperception of the reexamination_proceedings as well as the premises of a terminal_disclaimer

the terminal disclaimer
a rejection for obvious-type_double_patenting means that the claims of a later patent application are deemed obvious from the claims of an earlier patent
in re longi 759_f.2d_887 893 225_uspq_645 648 fed.cir.1985 ; in re braithwaite 379_f.2d_594 600 54_ccpa_1589 154_uspq_29 34 ccpa 1967
such situations may arise when developments and improvements are made as the inventor or persons associated with the inventor continue to work in the field of an invention
voluntary limitation of the term of the later-issued patent is a convenient response to an obvious-type double_patenting_rejection when the statutory requirement of common_ownership is met
any possible enlargement of the term of exclusivity is eliminated while enabling some limited protection to a patentees later developments

only the claims are compared in a rejection for double_patenting
such a rejection *874 by the patent office does not mean that the first-filed patent is a prior_art reference under ¡± 102 against the later-filed application
in re bowers 359_f.2d_886 887 53_ccpa_1590 149_uspq_570 572 ccpa 1966
thus the` obviation' of obvious-type_double_patenting by filing a terminal_disclaimer has no effect on a rejection under ¡± 103 based on the first-filed patent
such a rejection can not be overcome by a terminal_disclaimer
bowers 359 f.2d at 891_n._7 149 uspq at 575_n._76 a reference patent that is not of common_ownership or a publication or public_use or sale more than one year before the filing_date of the later-filed application can not be removed as prior_art by the filing of a terminal_disclaimer
in re bartfeld 925_f.2d_1450 1453-54 17_uspq2d_1885 1888 fed.cir.1991 ; in re fong 378_f.2d_977 979-big_token__80_n._1__big_token 54_ccpa_1482 154_uspq_25 27_n._1_(1967)

thus a terminal_disclaimer is of circumscribed availability and effect
it is not an admission of obviousness of the later-filed claimed invention in light of the earlier-filed disclosure for that is not the basis of the disclaimer

the district_court explaining its decision referred to two other district_court decisions that arose on somewhat similar facts
in gemveto jewelry co. v. jeff cooper inc. 568_f.supp._319 219_uspq_806_(s.d.n.y.1983) on retrial 694_f.supp._1085_(s.d.n.y.1988) affd
mem
884_f.2d_1399_(fed.cir.1989) the district_court held that by filing the terminal_disclaimer instead of contesting obviousness the patentee was estopped from contesting obviousness when confronted with a prior sale of the same product that was described and claimed in the earlier-filed patent
the district_court found that the prosecution_history left` no room to doubt that plaintiff admitted the obviousness of the later patent'
568 f.supp.at 327 219 uspq at 811
in a nonprecedential unpublished memorandum opinion the federal_circuit affirmed the district_courts judgment
we stress that such unpublished opinions are not to be taken as our adoption of the district_courts reasoning ; affirmance could have been on any ground appropriate to the case

another district_court in salomon s.a. v. rossignol ski co. inc. 715_f.supp._1274 1281-82 11_uspq2d_1589 1595-96 d.del.1989 declining to follow gemveto held that the filing of a terminal_disclaimer did not operate as an estoppel against contesting the merits of a later obviousness issue
the court instead held that the filing of the terminal_disclaimer presented a rebuttable presumption of acquiescence in the rejection for obviousness
as the district_court commented in the case at bar neither quad nor union has endorsed this analysis

we do not adopt the reasoning of the district_court in either gemveto or salomon although we recognize that these decisions may find support in their particular facts
in legal principle the filing of a terminal_disclaimer simply serves the statutory function of removing the rejection of double_patenting and raises neither presumption nor estoppel on the merits of the rejection
it is improper to convert this simple expedient of` obviation' into an admission or acquiescence or estoppel on the merits
analogy is seen in greenwood v. hattori seiko co. ltd. 900_f.2d_238 240-41 14_uspq2d_1474 1475-76 fed.cir.1990 where this court declined to find estoppel based on the examiners rejection for obviousness when this rejection had been obviated during prosecution of the patent application by the filing of a rule 131 affidavit 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.131
the district_court found at trial that the rule 131 affidavit was inadequate to remove the references and on appeal we agreed
we held however that the references did not thereby automatically invalidate the patent merely because the applicant had not argued the merits of the rejection before the *875 examiner but had instead invoked rule 131 to remove the references
see also paperless accounting inc. v. bay area rapid transit system 804_f.2d_659 663-64 231_uspq_649 652 fed.cir.1986 cert
denied 480_u.s._933 107_s.ct._1573 94_l.ed.2d_764_(1987) no presumption of acquiescence in the merits of the rejection by refiling the application

in the case of the461_patent the prosecution_history of the original patent shows that the589_patent was cited by the examiner and the461_patent specification expressly distinguishes the589 teachings thus supporting quads position that it did not admit the obviousness of the461 invention in view of the589_patent when the terminal_disclaimer was filed during reexamination
there was no reexamination on the merits of obviousness in view of the589_patent for the examiner withdrew the589_patent as prior_art ; and as discussed post the montfort commercial_use was not within the reexamination examiners jurisdiction
the district_court erred in holding that quad was estopped from contesting the merits of the obviousness of the claims in suit in view of the montfort_process

the montfort process
it was stipulated that the montfort_process embodied the invention of the589_patent and was in commercial_use more than a year before the filing of the461_patent

the district_court appeared to believe that disclosure of the use at montfort was wrongly withheld from the patent_examiner during reexamination
however questions of public_use and on sale were explicitly excluded by statute from those issues on which reexamination could be obtained
the manual of patent examining procedure m.p.e.p
then in effect provided ¡± 2216
...
questions relating to grounds of rejection other than those based on prior patents or printed publications such as public_use or sale.. should not be included in the request and will not be considered by the examiner if included.. ¡± 2217

... rejections [ on reexamination ] will not be based on matters other than patents or printed publications such as public_use or sale.. a rejection on prior public_use or sale.. can not be made even if it relies upon a prior patent or printed publication.. m.p.e.p
( 5th_ed. rev
2 dec. 1985
union asserts that under ¡± 2217 the examiner could have based reexamination on an admission of the montfort use
we do not agree for the several provisions of the m.p.e.p
then in effect fairly read in light of board decisions prohibited consideration of prior use or sale.7 the conclusion follows that quad is not now barred from defending validity on this ground

we conclude that quad is not estopped from arguing this issue in the district_court and that the court is required to make an independent review of the patentability of the461 claims over the montfort_process
as discussed in greenwood v. hattori in an infringement suit before a district_court the invalidity of a patent under *876 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 must be decided on the basis of prior_art adduced in the proceeding before the court
the issue can not be decided merely by accepting or rejecting the adequacy of the positions taken by the patentee in order to obtain a certificate of reexamination for the patent

( en banc cert
denied 474_u.s._828 106_s.ct._88 88_l.ed.2d_72_(1985) reexamination_proceedings` should not circumvent the burden placed on an infringer during litigation'
the courts are the final arbiter of patent_validity and although courts may take cognizance of and benefit from the proceedings before the patent_examiner the question is ultimately for the courts to decide without deference to the rulings of the patent_examiner

since no estoppel pertains the summary_judgment based thereon can not stand

frivolousness
union asserts that this appeal is frivolous referring to the deficiencies of quads arguments and the virtues of its own
in view of the absence of precedent supporting the district_courts decision and quads right to appellate review unions charge of frivolousness is an unwarranted burden on the proceedings and the court
we caution that demands for sanctions must be adequately supported lest they add to abuse of the adjudicative process
