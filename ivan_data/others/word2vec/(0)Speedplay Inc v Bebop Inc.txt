synopsis
licensee of clipless_bicycle_pedal and cleat patents sued manufacturer of competing clipless_pedal_system for patent and trade_dress infringement and defendant counterclaimed seeking declaration that patents were invalid
the united_states district court for the southern district of california james f. stiven j. found that patents were enforceable but that there was no infringement
cross-appeals were filed
the court of appeals bryson circuit_judge held that 1 licensee had standing to bring infringement_action in its own_name ; 2 defendants pedals were neither literally nor equivalently infringing ; 3 defendants cleats were not infringing ; 4 plaintiffs trade_dress was not infringed ; 5 patents were not unenforceable due to failure to disclose prior_art ; and 6 defendant was not entitled to attorney_fees

i. bryson circuit_judge
serious bicyclists often use pedal assemblies that enable them to secure their feet to the bicycle_pedals
the effect of such assemblies is to allow the bicyclists to increase the power transmitted to the wheels by simultaneously applying a downward pushing force with one foot and an upward pulling force with the other
clip-less_pedal and cleat assemblies offer one method of performing that function
with clip-less_pedals and cleats a rider can attach his feet securely to the pedals yet release them easily in contrast to earlier systems using straps or cages
the cleats attach to the riders shoes and engage the pedals which are specially designed to interact with the cleats
in most clip-less_pedal_systems the rider attaches his foot to the pedal by stepping straight *1249 down on the pedal until the cleat engages with the pedal
the rider typically releases his foot by rotating his foot to the side which disengages the cleat from the pedal

richard bryne the chief executive officer and founder of speedplay inc. is the inventor and primary designer of speedplays bicycle_pedals
he obtained u.s._patent_no._4942,778 the778_patent on a clip-less_pedal and cleat system and in 1992 entered the market with a product based on that patent
shortly thereafter bryne was issued u.s._patent_no._5213,009 the009_patent which claims a multilayered cleat design
within two years of its founding speedplay entered into two agreements with bryne
the first granted speedplay a license under the778_patent and improvements thereon while the second assigned to speedplay all of brynes bicycle-related inventions made during his employment with the company
steven zoumaras who held a 50 % interest in the778_patent in return for financing its procurement was also a party to the license but he assigned his entire interest to speedplay during the course of the trial

john steinberg the president and founder of bebop inc. is the inventor of the bebop bicycle_pedals
in 1989 steinberg conceived the basic idea for the bebop_pedal which features a hollow cylindrical body
over the next few years steinberg refined the concept obtained a patent on the invention and marketed two bebop_pedal designs

shortly after bryne saw a bebop prototype in 1993 the parties clashed over intellectual_property and commercial tort issues
the dispute led to the present lawsuit in which speedplay claimed that bebop was infringing the778 and009_patent s by manufacturing and marketing the bebop clip-less bicycle_pedals
in addition speedplay alleged that bebop was infringing speedplays trade_dress under section 43 a of the lanham act 15 u.s.c.¡± 1125 a was engaging in unfair competition under california common law and was violating the california business and professions code

bebop counterclaimed seeking a declaration that the778 and009_patent s were invalid that they were not infringed by bebops products and that bebops products did not infringe speedplays trade_dress
bebop also sought relief for alleged unfair competition and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage
while the case was pending bryne was issued u.s._patent_no._5606,894 the894_patent on a clip-less bicycle pedal and speedplay amended its complaint to add an allegation of infringement of the894_patent
bebop responded by alleging that the894_patent was invalid and that all three patents were unenforceable because of inequitable_conduct

following a 10-day bench trial the trial_court entered judgment against speedplay on all the claims in its amended complaint
with respect to bebops counterclaims the court held the894_patent invalid because the invention was on sale more than one year before the patent_application was filed
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b
the court denied relief to bebop however on its state law claims on its request to hold speedplays other two patents invalid and all three patents unenforceable and on its request for attorney_fees
both parties appealed

ii
bebop raises a threshold issue concerning speedplays right to bring an action for infringement of the778009 and894_patent s in its own_name
the trial_judge concluded that bryne had transferred` all right title and interest to the inventions' to speedplay thereby securing to speedplay the right to sue individually for infringement of the patents
we agree that speedplay has standing to maintain this suit

a party may bring an action for patent_infringement only if it is the` patentee' i.e. if it owns the patent either by *1250 issuance or by assignment
see 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 100 d 261 281
a party that has been granted all substantial_rights under the patent is considered the owner regardless of how the parties characterize the transaction that conveyed those rights
thus in vaupel textilmaschinen kg v. meccanica euro italia s.p.a. 944_f.2d_870 874 873-76 20_uspq2d_1045 1048 1047-50 fed.cir.1991 this court held that the proper focus is on` the substance of what was granted' and that the grantee of an exclusive license could sue in its own_name without joining the grantor if the license had the effect of conveying all substantial_rights in the patent to the licensee

speedplay asserts that it obtained all substantial_rights in the778009 and894_patent s from bryne and that it may therefore sue for infringement in its own_name
to support that assertion speedplay must produce a written instrument documenting the transfer of proprietary rights in the patents
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 261 ; enzo apa & son inc. v. geapag a.g. 134_f.3d_1090 1093 45_uspq2d_1368 1370-71 fed.cir.1998
speedplay relies on two documents a contribution and license_agreement and a confidentiality and inventions_agreement to support its assertion of patent_rights
bebop contends that those two documents are insufficient to allow speedplay to sue in its own_name

a
through the contribution and license_agreement cla speedplay issued common stock to bryne and zoumaras in exchange for broad rights in brynes initial pedal technology
the cla defines two categories of rights
first it defines` licensed_product' as follows bryne and zoumaras are the owners of a design for a clipless_bicycle_pedal_system as described and claimed in the united_states_letters_patent 4,942,778 issued july_24,_1990 to richard m. bryne and entitled clipless bicycle pedal system` licensed_product'.. second it defines` licensed_patents' as follows bryne is the inventor and title holder of united_states_letters_patent 4,522,221 and related foreign patent_applications collectively the` licensed_patents'.. based on those definitions the grant to speedplay consists of an` exclusive worldwide royalty-free right and license under and to the licensed_patents and the exclusive rights and license to manufacture have manufactured distribute market use and sell the licensed_product and any other_apparatus instrument device or product covered in whole or in part by the licensed_patents'
in addition the agreement permits speedplay to exercise its granted rights through agents and sublicensees
all rights under the cla terminate with the last to expire of the licensed_patents unless terminated earlier for various specified reasons such as breach or insolvency

the primary problem with the cla derives from the patent_number cited in the definition of licensed_patents
although naming bryne as the inventor the definition refers to u.s._patent_no._4522,221 which is an unrelated patent on unrelated technology issued and assigned to some unknown third parties
speedplay asserted at oral_argument that the reference to that patent was a scriveners error and that a reference to the778_patent was intended
that contention finds support in the portion of the cla that refers to` the licensed_product and any other_apparatus
.
.
covered
.
.
by the licensed_patents' which indicates that the term licensed_patents was meant to refer to patents that covered the licensed_product
in addition another provision of the cla requires speedplay to mark each licensed_product with a notice` identifying by u.s. patent_number the licensed_patent'
because a licensed_product is a pedal_system` described and claimed' by the *1251778_patent the cla could not logically require such a product to be marked with any patent_number other than 4,942,778
consequently we agree with speedplay that despite the patent_number erroneously set forth in the cla the explicitly defined licensed_patents must be construed to mean the778 and related foreign_patents

the conclusion that licensed_patents include the778_patent undermines bebops main argument that the cla did not transfer all substantial patent_rights to speedplay because speedplay did not receive the right to enforce the778_patent
under the cla speedplay has the` sole right to enforce the licensed_patents' which we construe as giving speedplay the right to enforce the778_patent

bebop argues in the alternative that bryne and zoumaras retained other substantial_rights in the778_patent that would prevent speedplay from suing on that patent in its own_name
bebops strongest argument on this point derives from the following language of the cla` in the event that [ speedplay ] fails to halt an infringement
.
.
within three 3 months' then` bryne and/or zoumaras shall have the option to initiate appropriate legal proceedings in his/their own_name'
relying on abbott laboratories v. diamedix corp. 47_f.3d_1128 33_uspq2d_1771_(fed.cir.1995) bebop claims that the grantors retention of that option is dispositive
we disagree

in abbott the licensor retained an option to sue an infringer if the exclusive licensee did not
even if the licensee brought suit it could not manage the action in a manner that would compromise the licensors rights in the patent and could not prevent the licensor from participating in the suit
in addition the grant to the licensee was subject to prior-granted licenses and to a limited right of the licensor to make use and sell products embodying the patented_invention
finally the licensee could not freely assign its license
considering all the rights retained by the licensor the court concluded that the licensor was a necessary party to the infringement_action brought by the licensee
abbott 47 f.3d at 1132 33 uspq2d at 1775

abbott does not control this case
unlike in abbott the license grant was not subject to any prior-granted licenses or to any retained rights by the licensor to practice the patent
moreover the cla does not grant bryne and zoumaras the right to participate in an infringement_action brought by speedplay nor does it limit speedplays management of any such action
in addition bryne and zoumarass right to sue an infringer if speedplay does not is illusory because speedplay can render that right nugatory by granting the alleged infringer a royalty-free sublicense
although the licensee in abbott could grant sublicenses its right to do so was not unfettered because it was liable for annual royalties on the sales of the sublicensees
abbott 47 f.3d at 1129 33 uspq2d at 1772
speedplay thus controls enforcement of the778_patent for all practical purposes
even though bryne and zoumaras retained the right to sue that right would not hinder speedplays enjoyment of the patent_rights in any meaningful way

bebop next contends that under the cla speedplay can not assign its interest in the license without the consent of bryne and zoumaras and that speedplays rights in the patent are therefore curtailed
to be sure the licensees inability to assign its interest was a factor important to the holding in abbott
but again the factual differences between abbott and this case dictate a different outcome
the licensor in abbott had an absolute right to veto any assignment proposed by the licensee other than to a successor in business
abbott 47 f.3d at 1132 33 uspq2d at 1775
under the cla however bryne and zoumarass consent to an assignment` shall not be withheld unreasonably'
bryne and zoumarass only reasonable basis for refusing consent would be the impairment *1252 of their consideration for entering the cla
as we held in vaupel 944 f.2d at 875 20 uspq2d at 1049 a licensor does not retain a substantial right in a patent merely by reserving a reversion in the patent contingent upon the licensees financial distress or the licensees cessation of production of machines embodying the patented_invention
in effect the vaupel termination provision simply protected the licensors consideration which consisted in part of an ongoing royalty stream
although the form of the protective mechanism differs in this case the principle of vaupel compels a conclusion that the consent requirement does not significantly restrict the scope of speedplays rights in the778_patent

bebop next argues that the` improvements' clause of the cla leaves a significant right in bryne and zoumaras
the cla defines an` improvement' to include` any invention or development that falls within the fair scope of any of the claims of the licensed_patent'
if speedplay makes improvements during the term of the agreement it is required to` assign to bryne and zoumaras as tenants in common all right title and interest in and to the improvements' including any related_patents and patent_applications
that right of bryne and zoumaras is limited however by the further provision of the cla that` [ t ] he improvements shall become part of the licensed_patent for purposes of this agreement'
as a consequence of that provision any partys successful effort to improve the pedal technology covered by the778_patent during the term of the agreement would redound to speedplays exclusive benefit for that term
the improvements_clause thus serves to protect bryne and zoumarass reversionary interest in any improvements but not to limit speedplays proprietary interests in improvements made during the pendency of the agreement

finally bebop claims that bryne and zoumaras retain two additional substantial_rights in the778_patent
the cla requires speedplay to mark products intended for foreign sale` in accordance with written instructions' from bryne and zoumaras
the right to dictate the markings on products sold abroad may or may not be significant as a practical matter but the right is certainly not one that interferes with the rights in a u.s. patent which are limited in reach to the united_states
see vaupel 944 f.2d at 875 20 uspq2d at 1049 finding that the licensors right to obtain foreign_patents did not affect the patent-standing inquiry
the cla also requires speedplay to allow bryne and zoumaras to inspect speedplays books and records regarding the exercise of rights under the agreement
given the clas provision for termination upon the insolvency of speedplay which is consistent with vaupels provision for termination upon bankruptcy see id. the inspection provision constitutes a policing mechanism not a substantial proprietary right
accordingly we conclude that bryne and zoumaras retained no substantial_rights in the778_patent and that speedplay therefore may sue in its own_name for infringement of that patent

b
because the009_patent claims a cleat that speedplay and bryne contend improves upon the cleat claimed in the778_patent speedplay argues that it obtained all significant rights to the009_patent pursuant to the improvements_clause of the cla
bebop does not challenge the basic factual contention that the009_patent is an improvement on the778_patent

as noted above speedplay obtains the rights to improvements made after the effective_date of the cla by any party to that agreement
bryne zoumaras and speedplay executed the cla on december 15 1991 with an agreed effective_date of september 20 1991
bryne applied for the009_patent on october 18 1991 subsequent to the effective_date of the cla
*1253 speedplay therefore obtained all substantial_rights to the009_patent

c. speedplay traces its rights in the894_patent to the confidentiality and inventions_agreement cia entered into on september 17 1992 by bryne as employee and speedplay as employer
the cia defines an` invention' to be any intellectual_property conceived or developed by bryne within the scope of his employment and during the term of the agreement
all inventions covered by the cia` shall belong exclusively to [ speedplay ] and [ bryne ] hereby conveys transfers and assigns to [ speedplay ]-.-
all right title and interest in and to inventions'
as the894 parent application was submitted on april_29,_1994 speedplay argues that it automatically obtained title to the894_patent pursuant to the cia
we agree

bebop challenges speedplays rights in the894_patent on two grounds
first bebop contends that the cia is merely a` promise to assign a future_invention'
that contention invokes this courts decision in arachnid inc. v. merit industries inc. 939_f.2d_1574 1576 19_uspq2d_1513 1514 fed.cir.1991 in which a contractor agreed that any inventions it conceived`shall be the property of [ the client ] and all rights thereto will be assigned` by the contractor to the client
holding that the client could not bring an infringement_action based on that contractual language the arachnid court characterized the promise as` an agreement to assign not an assignment'
id.at 1580 1580-81 19 uspq2d at 1518 1518-19
the language in the cia however differs significantly from the language at issue in arachnid
it provides that inventions` shall belong' to speedplay and that bryne` hereby conveys transfers and assigns' the inventions to speedplay
therefore this case is not controlled by arachnid but by filmtec corp. v. allied-signal inc. 939_f.2d_1568 1570 19_uspq2d_1508 1509 fed.cir.1991 in which the contractor agreed`to grant and does hereby grant` to the client the rights and title to any invention whether patentable or not
in filmtec this court stated that` no further act would be required once an invention came into being ; the transfer of title would occur by operation of law'
id.at 1573 939_f.2d_1568 19 uspq2d at 1512

second bebop seeks to distinguish between the assignment of a future_invention and the assignment of the patent on that invention implying that the cia does not cover the latter
filmtec which linked title to the invention and title to the ensuing patent also disposes of that argument

d. our disposition of the standing issue in this case does not expose bebop to the risk of prejudice that can result from improper joinder of parties in a suit for patent_infringement
by restricting the availability of a remedy for infringement to the de facto owner of the patent the standing doctrine serves` to enable the alleged infringer to respond in one action to all claims of infringement for his act and thus either to defeat all claims in the one action or by satisfying one adverse decree to bar all subsequent actions'
independent wireless telephone co. v. radio corp. of america 269_u.s._459 468 46_s.ct._166 70_l.ed._357_(1926)

bebop will not be exposed to a successive suit on the same subject matter brought by bryne in his own_name
confirming inferences drawn from the record counsel for speedplay admitted at oral_argument that speedplay is a closely held corporation and that bryne controls the operation of speedplay
also the record clearly shows that bryne participated actively in the conduct of the action on behalf of the corporation
consequently the judgment in this case will have preclusive effect with respect to any parallel claim that might be brought by bryne
see e.g. rhode island hosp
trust nat l bank v. *1254 bogosian in re belmont realty corp. 11_f.3d_1092 1097 1st cir.1993 ; kreager v. general elec co. 497_f.2d_468 472 2d cir.1974 ; restatement second of judgments ¡± 59 3 a 1982
in addition speedplay offered before trial to join bryne as a party but bebop resisted that motion
bebop therefore can not now reasonably complain that it is prejudiced by having to defend a lawsuit brought by speedplay without the participation of bryne as a party

iii
speedplay alleges that two of bebops products infringed the778 and009_patent s. the first designated the bebop-1 was sold between 1995_and_1997
the second designated the bebop-2 first sold in 1997

the bebop-1_pedal consists of a spindle that penetrates through a rotating metal cylinder that is open on the top and bottom and partially open on the sides
either of the roughly circular edges that constitute the top and bottom of the cylinder can engage with the cleat whereupon spring-loaded tongues on each side of the cleat secure the pedal to the cleat by protruding into the openings in the sides of the cylinder

in the bebop-2 the cylindrical_portion of the pedal does not consist of a single piece of metal but comprises two circular metal rings that correspond generally to the two edge-portions of the bebop-1_cylinder
the two rings are connected by screws to each other and to the spindle_housing so that the space between the two rings is largely open except for the spindle_housing
either of the two rings can engage with the spring-loaded tongues in the cleat in the same way that the top or bottom edge of the bebop-1_cylinder can engage with the cleat

?
a. speedplay alleged infringement of 12 of the778_patents claims including independent_claim 1 which reads in relevant_part as follows a clipless_bicycle_pedal_system for releasably binding the sole of a riders shoe to a pedal which comprises a pedal comprising an axle fixedly attached to the end of a crank arm of a bicycle ; and
a block rotatably mounted on said axle said block having a top a bottom and a circumferential_edge said top and said bottom each being a generally convex_surface said block being generally circular in the lateral_plane with said circumferential_edges joining said top to [ said ] bottom and a leading edge and a trailing edge oppositely disposed within said circumferential_edge and having a plurality of grooves formed in said circumferential_edge of said pedal and aligned with longitudinal and lateral_planes of a bicycle on which said pedal_system is mounted *1255 at least one of said grooves toward said trailing edge of said pedal_block and one toward said leading edge..
the critical language of the claim for purposes of this case is the reference to the body of the pedal as consisting of a` block having a top a bottom and a circumferential_edge said top and said bottom each being a generally convex_surface'
relevant_drawings showing the pedal_block item 12 and convex_surfaces item 13 of the778_patent embodiment are set forth below

?
speedplay alleges that the trial_court erred in finding no infringement of the778_patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
given the requirement that the pedal consist of a block with top and bottom surfaces that are generally convex however the trial_court was plainly correct in finding that neither the bebop-1 nor the bebop-2 literally infringes claim 1 of the778_patent
neither the open ends of the bebop-1_cylinder nor the open rings of the bebop-2 structure have generally convex_surfaces that serve as the top or bottom of a block as is required by the778_patent
therefore the bebop_pedals do not embody every limitation of the pertinent claims of the778_patent and can not literally infringe

in order to find infringement of the778_patent under the doctrine of equivalents the court would have to find every limitation of claim 1 present in the bebop_pedals either literally or equivalently
see ethicon endo-surgery inc. v. united_states surgical corp. 149_f.3d_1309 1315-19 47_uspq2d_1272 1276-79 fed.cir.1998
as in the case of literal infringement the` convex_surface' limitation of claim 1 defeats speedplays argument that the bebop_pedals infringe under the doctrine of equivalents

bebops patent_expert testified at trial that the convex_surface of the block recited in the claim performs two functions
first the convex_surface compresses the tongues in the cleat as the cleat descends on the pedal ; the tongues then resile upon encountering the open groove in the circumference of the pedal
second the convex_surface causes the pedal to align with the cleat as the cleat descends onto it
speedplays patent_expert agreed that the convex_surface_limitation performed both of those functions and bebop introduced evidence that a convex_surface would promote self-alignment

the patent_specification and a statement made by bryne in a reissue_application for the778_patent also focus on the self-alignment_function of the convex-surface limitation
in a section entitled` detailed description of the invention' the patent_specification describes the cooperation between the pedal and the cleat as follows numbers refer to items in the778 drawings set forth above the rider places the shoe 25 with cleat 4 over pedal [ assembly ] 12
the symmetrical curved top surface of the pedal centers the recessed area 11 over pedal 12 guiding cleat 4 to its proper position
even if the pedal is not parallel to [ the ] lateral_plane.. at the time the rider initially attempts to engage cleat 4 and pedal 12 the curved surface 13 of pedal *1256 12 will cause block 12 [ i.e. the body of the pedal assembly ] to rotate so that cleat 4 is centered over pedal 12
in the reissue_application bryne described the importance of the critical limitation as follows clearly the convex nature of the top and the bottom is essential to the function of the overall pedal_system in order to properly interact with the cleat..
the convex_surface of the top and the bottom situated on either side of a pedal platform.. [ allows the pedal ] to engage the cleat.. even if the top or bottom is not perfectly vertically positioned immediately prior to attempted engagement of the pedal and cleat
in deposition and trial testimony bryne appeared to retreat from these comments stating that the convex_surface primarily serves to compress the tongues of the cleat and that` self-locating comes from having a circular_shape in a circular_shape'
the trial_court however was entitled to accord little_weight to the` litigation-induced pronouncements of the inventor' which were contrary to clear statements in the written description and reissue_application
vehicular techs corp. v. titan wheel int l inc. 141_f.3d_1084 1092 46_uspq2d_1257 1263 fed.cir.1998
consequently the trial_court correctly determined that the convex_surface_limitation requires an equivalent structure in the bebop_pedals to perform a self-alignment_function

although primarily focusing on the bebop-2_pedal the trial_court determined that the bebop_pedals do not perform a self-aligning function and the evidence supports that factual finding
speedplays expert claimed that a small bevel on the edges and rings of the bebop_pedal` enable [ s ] the initial engagement.. the initial seating [ of the pedal ] into the recess'
bebops witnesses however denied that the bebop_pedals perform a self-alignment_function and it was not clearly erroneous for the trial_court to accept bebops evidence on that point and reject speedplays contrary_evidence
we therefore affirm the trial_judges ruling that bebops products do not infringe the778_patent

b. speedplay alleged that the bebop products infringe three claims of the009_patent under the doctrine of equivalents independent_claim 17 and dependent claims 20_and_21
claim 17 provides in relevant_part as follows emphasis added a cleat for attachment to a sole of a bicycle shoe for use with a clipless_bicycle_pedal said sole having a toe end and a heel end and a plurality of bores having a spacing according to an industry standard and being generally flat at its lower surface said cleat comprising a first_plate having a cavity at its center a first_plurality of slots generally aligned with said plurality of bores and at least one channel adjacent to said cavity said cavity having a diameter for receiving at least a portion of said clipless_bicycle_pedal ; at least one spring means to be retained in said at least one channel so that a portion of said at least one spring means extends into said cavity ; a second plate abutting said first_plate and having a perimeter corresponding to the perimeter of said first_plate a second_plurality of slots aligned with said first_plurality of slots and an opening corresponding to said cavity ; and
a fastening means inserted through each slot of said second_plurality and through each corresponding slot of said first_plurality to be received in each bore of said plurality ; wherein insertion of said at least a portion of said clipless_bicycle_pedal into said cavity causes said spring means to releasably retain said clipless_bicycle_pedal adjacent to said sole
the emphasized limitations resolve the infringement issue
the trial_court construed` slot' to mean a` narrow notch *1257 groove or opening in a plate'
speedplay does not contest that construction
relevant_drawings from the009_patent are set forth below showing the first item 50 and second item 62 plurality of slots

?
the cleats of the bebop-1 and bebop-2 are essentially identical for purposes of this case
each has a metal base_plate that attaches to the sole of the riders shoe with two fasteners that pass through a two-hole_washer and through each end of an elongated aperture in the base_plate of the cleat
two small crescent-shaped metal plates are mounted on either end of the base_plate accommodating the top edge of the cylindrical_portion of the bebop-1_pedal or top ring of the bebop-2_pedal within the generally circular recess formed by the crescent plates inner edges
each crescent is attached with three fasteners and supported away from the base_plate by spacers and by the stationary end of the spring-loaded tongue that secures the pedal to the cleat
the floating end of the spring-loaded tongue resides in the area under the crescent-shaped pieces of metal
assembled and exploded views of the bebop cleat are shown below

?
speedplays expert offered a limitation-by-limitation comparison of the009_patent with the bebop_cleats
according to speedplays expert the` first_plate' limitation of claim 17 is met equivalently by combining bebops base_plate and the spacers supporting the crescents
in the experts view the aperture in the base_plate functions as the claimed` plurality of slots' by allowing the two fasteners to pass through the base_plate and secure the cleat to the shoe
the second plate the expert contended comprises the two crescent-shaped plates and the two-hole_washer that retains the base_plate
the` second_plurality of slots' limitation according to the expert is met equivalently by the two holes in the washer

although speedplays expert identified the structures in the bebop_cleats that he alleged to be equivalents of the two plurality-of-slots limitations in the patent the expert did not identify the way the slot_limitations perform the function of accommodating the fasteners that secure the cleat to the shoe
therefore his testimony did not establish that the corresponding structures in the bebop cleat perform that *1258 function in a substantially identical way
speedplays trial brief and the claim chart attached to it likewise failed to satisfy the legal standard for a finding of equivalence with respect to the slot_limitations

strong and unrebutted evidence in the record supports the conclusion that the slots in claim 17 allow adjustment of the cleats position on the sole either forward-and-backward or side-to-side
for example the009_patent_specification mentions adjustment frequently when referring to a slot noting that the slots allow adjustment` to match the individual riders foot and knee rotation for comfort and to optimize energy transfer from the foot to the pedal'
discussing his development of the invention that resulted in the009_patent bryne testified that the slots allow adjustment of the cleat on the sole

bebops founder also testified that he understood the claimed slots to allow adjustment
as to the bebop_cleats however he testified that the single elongated aperture in the base_plate allows` virtually no adjustability of the location of the fasteners'
no evidence was offered to rebut that testimony

because the evidence indicates that the slot_limitations in the009_patent allow the fasteners to secure the cleat to the shoe in an adjustable_way and that the corresponding structure on the base_plate of the bebop_cleats-the elongated aperture-does not accommodate the fasteners in an adjustable_way the trial_judge permissibly found that the bebop_cleats did not infringe the009_patent under the doctrine of equivalents

iv
the trial_court rejected speedplays claim that bebop infringed its trade_dress rights
under ninth circuit law which applies to speedplays lanham act claim speedplay was required to prove that its trade_dress is distinctive and nonfunctional and that consumers are likely to confuse bebops pedals with speedplays pedals
see disc golf ass n v. champion discs inc. 158_f.3d_1002 1005 48_uspq2d_1132 1134 9th cir.1998
the trial_court found that speedplay proved its design to be distinctive but did not prove nonfunctionality or likelihood of confusion

despite speedplays contrary assertion the trial_court considered the evidence offered by speedplay and found that evidence insufficient to support a conclusion that confusion was likely
the court unpersuaded by speedplays contrary_evidence determined that the two products are sold in distinct markets
in addition the court acknowledged the isolated instances of actual_confusion cited by speedplay but accorded them little_weight under the circumstances
cf nutri/system inc. v. con-stan indus. inc. 809_f.2d_601 606-07 1_uspq2d_1809 1813 9th cir.1987 concluding that the evidence of actual_confusion was de minimis in light of the nature of the instances and the volume of the parties business

the trial_courts finding that there was little likelihood of confusion is not clearly erroneous which is the standard of review that the ninth circuit applies to a trial_courts finding on that issue
see levi strauss & co. v. blue bell inc. 778_f.2d_1352 1355-56 228_uspq_346 348-49 9th cir.1985 en banc
we therefore uphold the courts ruling on the trade_dress issue without addressing the courts alternative ruling on the issue of functionality

v. at trial bebop sought to have speedplays patents declared unenforceable because of inequitable_conduct on speedplays part
the trial_court determined that bebop did not show by clear and convincing_evidence that speedplay and its *1259 counsel intended to mislead the patent and trademark office pto and therefore refused to hold the patents unenforceable
in its cross-appeal bebop claims that speedplay and its counsel intentionally failed to disclose material prior_art to the pto during prosecution of the778009 and894_patent s. in addition bebop alleges that the pendency of the present litigation was material_information that speedplay should have disclosed to the pto in connection with the prosecution of the894_patent
for those reasons bebop argues the three patents should be held unenforceable

a party alleging that a patent is unenforceable because of the patentees failure to disclose material_information to the pto must offer clear and convincing_evidence that the patentee intended to mislead the pto
see molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 33_uspq2d_1823 1826 fed.cir.1995
the omission must be made with the specific intent to mislead not merely from carelessness in the performance of a duty
id.at 1181 48_f.3d_1172 33 uspq2d at 1829
when a trial_court makes a finding on the issue of intent in deciding an inequitable-conduct claim we review that finding for clear error
id.at 1178 48_f.3d_1172 33 uspq2d at 1827

bryne and his patent counsel testified that they did not intend to deceive the pto
although they admitted familiarity with much of the prior_art cited by bebop they contended that the prior_art was not material
the trial_judge credited their testimony regarding their opinions of the prior_art citing supporting evidence that some of the art taught away from the claimed invention that similar patents had issued over the prior_art and that speedplays patent_specifications discussed in general terms much of the prior_art

although we agree with bebop that a` mere denial of intent to mislead' does not suffice see critikon inc. v. becton dickinson vascular access inc. 120_f.3d_1253 1257 43_uspq2d_1666 1669 fed.cir.1997 the trial_judges finding of lack of intent was supported by adequate evidence and was not clearly erroneous
the cases on which bebop relies all involve stronger circumstantial evidence of deceptive intent
see e.g. elk corp. v. gaf bldg
materials corp. 168_f.3d_28 30-32 49_uspq2d_1853 1855-57 fed.cir
( relying on the facts that the application claimed an improvement over the prior_art that the inventors request for a patentability search noted the similarity of the art and that the prosecuting attorneys testimony indicated knowledge that the prior_art was material cert
denied 528_u.s._873 120_s.ct._178 145_l.ed.2d_150_(1999) ; critikon 120 f.3d at 1256 43 uspq2d at 1669 citing the patentees knowledge that the prior-art reference read on a point of novelty that the examiner relied upon in prosecution ; molins 48 f.3d at 1181-82 33 uspq2d at 1829 drawing an inference of intent from the fact that the patentee had cited the art in foreign applications but not in the u.s. application

bebop further contends that speedplay engaged in a pattern of inequitable_conduct that requires holding all three patents unenforceable
in consolidated aluminum corp. v. foseco international ltd. 910_f.2d_804 812 15_uspq2d_1481 1487 fed.cir.1990 this court held that the intentional fabrication of a fictitious best mode in one patent rendered unenforceable three other patents in which the earlier concealment of best mode` permeated the prosecution'
our analysis in consolidated aluminum made clear however that we would have to find inequitable_conduct sufficient to hold at least one patent unenforceable before considering whether to hold an entire group of related_patents unenforceable
because we have sustained the trial_courts conclusion that no such inequitable_conduct occurred in this case we decline bebops invitation to hold all three of speedplays patents unenforceable because of an alleged pattern of inequitable_conduct

*1260 vi
finally bebop claims that it is entitled to its attorney_fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285 and federal rule of civil procedure 37 c

in support of its claim for an award of fees under section 285 bebop alleges that speedplay acted inequitably and failed to conduct an adequate investigation before bringing suit
we have already upheld the trial_courts ruling that speedplay did not engage in inequitable_conduct
with respect to the failure to investigate bebop contends that it incurred unnecessary legal fees preparing for trial on issues involving the894_patent which was held invalid because the invention was on sale more than one year before the patent_application was filed
the courts ruling on the on-sale bar issue was based on an invoice that speedplay produced during trial
bebop claims that speedplay did not adequately search its records in response to discovery requests regarding the first-sale date
bebop also claims that it incurred additional unnecessary expenses because speedplay did not adequately determine whether the patent claims read on bebops products

bebop cites several cases for the proposition that section 285 fees should be imposed because speedplay brought an action that it knew or` on reasonable investigation' should have known was unfounded
those cases all involved more extreme conduct than was present here
in eltech systems corp. v. ppg industries inc. 903_f.2d_805 810 14_uspq2d_1965 1969 fed.cir.1990 for example we affirmed an award of fees because the trial_court had before it evidence that the patentee knew its action was unfounded
similarly in judin v. united_states 110_f.3d_780 784 42_uspq2d_1300 1304 fed.cir.1997 we upheld the imposition of sanctions because the patentee had not procured a sample of the allegedly infringing device before filing suit and in hughes v. novi american inc. 724_f.2d_122 124 220_uspq_707 709 fed.cir.1984 an award of fees was affirmed because the patentee had undertaken widespread sales more than two years before the date of the patent_application yet resisted the defendants efforts to have the patent declared invalid based on the on-sale bar

the trial_court in this case did not abuse its discretion by declining to award attorney_fees to bebop
speedplays attorneys engaged a qualified expert to prepare for trial on the patent_infringement issues and its discovery of an invoice for a sale that predated by two months the date previously given for its first sale does not constitute such egregious conduct as to compel the court to treat this as an exceptional case

bebop bases its request for fees under rule 37 c on speedplays refusal to make certain admissions in response to bebops requests for admission
we have examined bebops list of requests and conclude that all of speedplays denials appear to have been made in good faith based on a reasonable belief in the possibility of success at trial
construing the trial_courts denial of fees as a ruling on the rule 37 issue we find that bebop has failed to show that the court abused its discretion in denying bebops request for sanctions

affirmed
