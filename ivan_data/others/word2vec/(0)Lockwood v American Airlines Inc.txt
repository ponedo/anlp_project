background
the pertinent facts are not in dispute
lockwood owns the115355 and359_patent s all of which relate to automated interactive sales terminals that provide sales_presentations to customers and allow the customers to order goods and services
lockwood sued american asserting that americans sabrevision airline reservation system infringed all three patents
sabrevision is used by travel_agents to access schedule and fare information to book itineraries and to retrieve photographs of places of interest including hotels restaurants and cruises for display to consumers
it improves upon americans sabre reservation system which originated in the 1960s and which can not display photographs

the115_patent reissued in 1986 relates to a self-service sales terminal that presents audio-visual travelogs to customers
claim 11 the only asserted claim reads in pertinent_part a substantially self-contained apparatus dimensioned to be easily transported and installed at a commercial location comprising an audio-visual_means for selectively dispensing information from a plurality of data sources ; customer operated means for selecting information to be dispensed on said audio-visual_means including means for sequentially and interactively displaying alternate selections of information on said audio-visual_means in response to customers commands ;.. at least one electromechanical means for accepting payment for said item from the customer ;..

the district_court held that americans sabrevision did not infringe the115_patent because it lacked four limitations of the asserted claim
specifically the court found that sabrevision was not a` substantially self-contained apparatus dimensioned to be easily transported' and that it lacked the claimed` audio-visual_means'` customer operated means' and` means for collecting payment'

the359_patent discloses a system of multiple interactive self-service_terminals that provide audio-visual sales_presentations and dispense goods and services from multiple_institutions
claim 1 the only_independent_claim reads in pertinent_part a system for automatically dispensing information goods and services for a plurality of institutions in a particular_industry comprising.. at least one customer sales and information_terminal.... said sales and information_terminal including audio-visual_means for interaction with a customer comprising means for storing a sequence of audio and video_information to be selectively transmitted to a customer ; means for transmitting a selected sequence of said stored information to the customer ; *1569 customer operated input_means for gathering information from a customer..

the district_court held that sabrevision did not infringe the359_patent because it lacked the` audio-visual_means' and` customer operated input_means'
the court also held the359_patent invalid because it would have been obvious in light of the original_sabre_system in combination with the self-service terminal disclosed in u.s._patent 4,359,631 which issued in 1982 and was subsequently reissued as the115_patent

finally the355_patent which issued in 1994 discloses a system for augmenting the sales and marketing capabilities of travel_agents in conjunction with airline reservation systems by allowing travel_agents to compose individual customized sales_presentations for their clients
claim 1 the only_independent_claim reads in pertinent_part a system for automatically dispensing information goods or services for a plurality of institutions in a particular_industry comprising a central data processing center including means for storing service price rate information or sales information for each institution ; at least one merchandising apparatus.... said merchandising apparatus including a means for composing and displaying individualized_sales_presentations according to determinants entered into said apparatus and based on a customers profile and requests.. storage means holding a plurality of randomly accessible segments of data ;.. means for selectively combining said determinants to address and retrieve at least one of said segments..

the district_court held that sabrevision did not infringe the355_patent because inter alia it did not compose` individualized_sales_presentations' or` selectively combine' customer_information to retrieve its photographs
the court further held the355_patent invalid under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b on the ground that its claims were anticipated by the359_patent
the355_patent issued from a chain of applications originating with the application that issued as the359_patent
the district_court held that the355_patent is not entitled to the filing_date of the original parent application and thus concluded that the359_patent is anticipating prior_art
lockwood now appeals to this court arguing that the district_court erred in its construction of the claims of all three patents and contending that summary_judgment in favor of american on each issue is precluded because genuine_issues of material_fact remain in dispute

discussion
we review a district_courts grant of summary_judgment de novo
conroy v. reebok int l ltd. 14_f.3d_1570 1575 29_uspq2d_1373 1377 fed.cir.1994
summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine_issue as to any material_fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
fed.r.civ.p
56 c
thus summary_judgment may be granted when no` reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party'
see anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 248 106_s.ct._2505 2510 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986) ; conroy 14 f.3d at 1575 29 uspq2d at 1377` the moving party.. may discharge its burden by showing the district_court that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving partys case`
in determining whether there is a genuine_issue of material_fact we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion with doubts resolved in favor of the opponent
transmatic inc. v. gulton indus. inc. 53_f.3d_1270 1274 35_uspq2d_1035 1038 fed.cir.1995

a. validity
the district_court held that the asserted claims of the359_patent would have *1570 been obvious in light of the prior_art631_patent and the original_sabre_system
a determination of obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a legal conclusion involving factual inquiries
uniroyal inc. v. rudkin-wiley corp. 837_f.2d_1044 1050 5_uspq2d_1434 1438 fed.cir.1988
lockwood argues that the subject_matter of the359 claims would not have been obvious and that the district_court impermissibly drew adverse factual inferences in concluding that the patent was invalid
lockwood first argues that the district_court erred in concluding that the sabre_system qualified as prior_art

american submitted an affidavit averring that the sabre_system was introduced to the public in 1962 had over one thousand connected sales desks by 1965 and was connected to the reservation systems for most of the other airlines by 1970
lockwood does not dispute these facts but argues that because` critical aspects' of the sabre_system were not accessible to the public it could not have been prior_art
americans expert conceded that the essential algorithms of the sabre software were proprietary and confidential and that those aspects of the system that were readily apparent to the public would not have been sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to duplicate the system
however american responds that the public need not have access to the` inner workings' of a device for it to be considered` in public_use' or` used by others' within the meaning of the statute

we agree with american that those aspects of the original_sabre_system relied on by the district_court are prior_art to the359_patent
the district_court held that sabre which made and confirmed reservations with multiple_institutions e.g. airlines hotels and car rental agencies combined with the terminal of the631_patent rendered the asserted claims of the359_patent obvious
the terminal of the631_patent admittedly lacked this` multiple institution' feature
it is undisputed however that the public was aware that sabre possessed this capability and that the public had been using sabre to make travel reservations from independent travel agencies prior to lockwoods date of invention

if a device was` known or used by others' in this country before the date of invention or if it was` in public_use' in this country more than one year before the date of application it qualifies as prior_art
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a and b 1994
lockwood attempts to preclude summary_judgment by pointing to record testimony that one skilled in the art would not be able to build and practice the claimed invention without access to the secret aspects of sabre
however it is the claims that define a patented invention
see constant v. advanced micro-devices inc. 848_f.2d_1560 1571 7_uspq2d_1057 1064 fed.cir.1988
as we have concluded earlier in this opinion americans public_use of the high-level aspects of the sabre_system was enough to place the claimed features of the359_patent in the publics possession
see in re epstein 32_f.3d_1559 1567-68 31_uspq2d_1817 1823 fed.cir.1994` beyond thisin public_use or on sale finding there is no requirement for an enablement-type inquiry`
lockwood can not negate this by evidence showing that other unclaimed aspects of the sabre_system were not publicly available
moreover the359_patent itself does not disclose the level of detail that lockwood would have us require of the prior_art
for these reasons lockwood fails to show a genuine_issue of material_fact precluding summary_judgment

lockwood further argues that even if the sabre_system is effective prior_art the combination of that system and the631_patent would not have yielded the invention of the359_patent
the terminal in the claims of the359_patent includes a number of means-plus-function limitations subject to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 including` means for gathering information from a customer' and` means for storing a sequence of audio and video_information to be selectively transmitted to a customer'
means-plus-function clauses are construed` as limited to the corresponding structure [ s ] disclosed in the specification and equivalents thereof'
in re *1571 donaldson co. 16_f.3d_1189 1195 29_uspq2d_1845 1850 fed.cir.1994 in banc ; see 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 1994
lockwood argues that the structures disclosed in the359_patent differ substantially from the terminal disclosed in the631_patent and that at the very least his experts declaration raised genuine_issues of material_fact sufficient to preclude summary_judgment

we do not agree
we believe that american has met its burden even in light of the presumption of patent validity to show that the means limitations relating to the terminal in the claims of the359_patent appear in the631 specification
lockwood has failed to respond by setting forth specific facts that would raise a genuine_issue for trial
specifically lockwood has not alleged that the631 disclosure lacks the structures disclosed in the359_patent specification or their equivalents
as the district_court noted lockwoods expert dr. tuthill relied on structures that are not mentioned in either the631 or the359_patent s. for example tuthill states that the claimed invention differs from the631_patent because the terminal described in the631_patent uses a` backward-chaining' system to solve problems while the359_patent uses a` forward-chaining' system
yet neither the359 nor the631_patent s mentions backward- or forward-chaining
nor does the359 specification describe any hardware or software structure as being limited to any particular problem-solving technique
in addition lockwood argues that the hardware and software disclosed in the two patents are not equivalent to each other
however the359_patent_claims the hardware and software in broad terms and the patents both describe similar computer controlled self-service_terminals employing video_disk_players that store and retrieve audio-visual information
for example with regard to the` means for controlling said storage and transmitting means' lockwoods expert avers that the` structure described in the359_patent which corresponds to this means is the processor unit and the application program which the processor executes'
yet the only software descriptions in the359_patent consist of high level exemplary functional flowcharts
lockwoods arguments and his experts statements are thus conclusory
they fail to identify which structures in the359_patent are thought to be missing from the631_patent disclosure
accordingly we agree with the district_court that lockwoods and his experts declarations have not adequately responded to americans motion by raising genuine_issues of material_fact and we therefore conclude that the district_court properly held the asserted claims of the359_patent to have been obvious as a matter of law

lockwood also argues that the district_court erred in holding the355_patent invalid as anticipated by the359_patent
the359_patent issued in 1986 from the first application in a chain of five applications which ultimately issued as the359_patent
it is undisputed that the359_patent discloses the invention ultimately claimed in the355_patent
because the third fourth and fifth applications were filed more than one year after the359_patent issued the validity of the355_patent turns on whether it is entitled to the filing_date of the second application the relevant subject_matter of which is undisputedly entitled to the benefit of the original application

in order to gain the benefit of the filing_date of an earlier_application under 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 each application in the chain leading back to the earlier_application must comply with the written description_requirement of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
in re hogan 559_f.2d_595 609 194_uspq_527 540 ccpa 1977
the district_court held that two of the three intervening applications failed to maintain the continuity of disclosure and thus concluded that the355_patent was not entitled to the necessary earlier filing_date

lockwood argues that the district_court erred by looking solely at the applications themselves
we do not agree
it is the disclosures of the applications that count
entitlement to a filing_date does not extend to subject_matter which is not disclosed but *1572 would be obvious over what is expressly disclosed
it extends only to that which is disclosed
while the meaning of terms phrases or diagrams in a disclosure is to be explained or interpreted from the vantage point of one skilled in the art all the limitations must appear in the specification
the question is not whether a claimed invention is an obvious variant of that which is disclosed in the specification
rather a prior_application itself must describe an invention and do so in sufficient detail that one skilled in the art can clearly conclude that the inventor invented the claimed invention as of the filing_date sought
see martin v. mayer 823_f.2d_500 504 3_uspq2d_1333 1337 fed.cir.1987 stating that it is` not a question of whether one skilled in the art might be able to construct the patentees device from the teachings of the disclosure.. rather it is a question whether the application necessarily discloses that particular device'
( quoting jepson v. coleman 50_c.c.p.a._1051 314_f.2d_533 536 136_uspq_647 649-50 1963
lockwood argues that all that is necessary to satisfy the description_requirement is to show that one is` in possession' of the invention
lockwood accurately states the test see vas-cath inc. v. mahurkar 935_f.2d_1555 1563-64 19_uspq2d_1111 1117 fed.cir.1991 but fails to state how it is satisfied
one shows that one is` in possession' of the invention by describing the invention with all its claimed limitations not that which makes it obvious
id
(` [ t ] he applicant must also convey to those skilled in the art that as of the filing_date sought he or she was in possession of the invention
the invention is for purposes of thewritten description inquiry whatever is now claimed'
( emphasis in original
one does that by such descriptive means as words structures figures diagrams formulas etc. that fully set forth the claimed invention
although the exact terms need not be used in haec verba see eiselstein v. frank 52_f.3d_1035 1038 34_uspq2d_1467 1470 fed.cir.1995` [ t ] he prior_application need not describe the claimed subject_matter in exactly the same terms as used in the claims..' the specification must contain an equivalent description of the claimed subject_matter
a description which renders obvious the invention for which an earlier filing_date is sought is not sufficient

lockwood further argues that his experts declaration was sufficient to raise a genuine_issue of material_fact regarding what the intervening applications disclosed to one skilled in the art
however as american argues one intervening application failed to disclose a computer system connected to multiple_vendors and another while disclosing a central_computer with a video_disk_player failed to disclose individual merchandising apparatus that contained video_disk_players or other equivalent storage means
lockwoods expert averred that the disclosed terminal in the former application` can be connected' to multiple_vendors and that although the latter application only` discusses the use of a television set and a keypad at a consumers home' it would have been apparent to one skilled in the art that` lockwood also envisioned the use of a terminal' containing a video_disk_player
that does not solve lockwoods problem
lockwood claimed a distinct invention from that disclosed in the specification
it is not sufficient for purposes of the written description_requirement of ¡± 112 that the disclosure when combined with the knowledge in the art would lead one to speculate as to modifications that the inventor might have envisioned but failed to disclose
each application in the chain must describe the claimed features
it is undisputed that one of the intervening applications does not describe an individual terminal containing a video_disk_player
therefore the declaration by lockwoods expert does not raise a genuine_issue of material_fact
the district_court correctly held that the355_patent was invalid as anticipated by the359_patent

b
infringement
determining whether a patent_claim has been infringed requires a two-step analysis` first the claim must be properly construed to determine its scope and meaning
*1573 second the claim as properly construed must be compared to the accused device or process'
carroll_touch inc. v. electro mechanical sys. inc. 15_f.3d_1573 1576 27_uspq2d_1836 1839 fed.cir.1993
claim construction is to be determined by the court
markman v. westview instruments inc. 517_u.s._370 -- -- 116_s.ct._1384 1387 134_l.ed.2d_577 38_uspq2d_1461 1463 1996` we hold that the construction of a patent including terms of art within its claim is exclusively within the province of the court`
in construing the claims the court looks to the claims the specification the prosecution_history and if necessary extrinsic evidence
vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 39_uspq2d_1573 1576 fed.cir.1996
application of the properly construed claim to the accused device is a question of fact

lockwood argues that the district_court misconstrued all four elements of the115_patent_claims cited by the district_court
first lockwood contends that properly construed the term` self-contained' means an` apparatus or collection of components which includes the materials necessary for the apparatus to function on its own' and that the language` easily transported' includes a collection of components of comparable size and weight to those disclosed

american argues that lockwoods interpretation of these terms is flatly inconsistent with his interpretation before the patent and trademark office pto
we agree
the limitation` self-contained apparatus dimensioned to be easily transported' was added after the pto rejected lockwoods claims as obvious in light of a business transaction computer system disclosed in u.s._patent 3,705,384
in response to the rejection lockwood distinguished the prior_art system which was composed of multiple cabinets that filled a room stating` [ a ] pplicants device on the other hand is a free-standing self contained unit which can be moved from location to location'
during the prosecution of the patent lockwood thus differentiated his device from the prior_art because of its compact_physical_dimensions not because of its ability to` function on its own'
in fact the interpretation of the words` self-contained' that lockwood now advances is insufficient to distinguish his invention from the prior_art because the prior_art_patent also discloses a system that can function independently
lockwood can not now argue for an interpretation inconsistent with this earlier representation
`` claims may not be construed one way in order to obtain their allowance and in a different way against accused infringers'

second lockwood asserts that the term` audio-visual' refers to either video presentations or audio_presentations but not necessarily to both
we disagree
the115_patent specification states that the unit displays travel documentaries and that a` high-quality audio-visual travelog can utilize practically all the human senses to motivate and influence a customer'
during prosecution lockwood argued although certain alpha numeric data are presented in the [ prior_art ] reference and such as in airport terminals which display schedules etc. these are to be distinguished from applicants device which actually presents brief travelogues and other movie-quality audio visual presentations to sell a product
although lockwood correctly notes that the disclosed terminal displays an initial selection menu that does not produce any sound this menu is not referred to as an` audio-visual' presentation
rather the selection menu is merely a method used for choosing an` audio-visual' presentation
examination of the claims specification and prosecution_history leads us to conclude that the district_court correctly interpreted this term as requiring a device that produces both audio and video
it is undisputed that the sabrevision system can not produce audio_presentations

*1574 third lockwood argues that the word` customer' should be construed to mean` someone with whom you do business' and therefore that americans` customers' are the travel_agents that use sabrevision
american counters that the patent itself explicitly excludes travel_agents from the definition of` customer'
we agree
the specification states that the purpose of the invention is to replace travel_agents so that the customer can purchase travel-related goods and services directly
it is` a new device capable of performing the promotion and sales of services such as those commonly dispensed by travel agencies in a fully automated fashion and from easily accessible locations'
given the patent specifications use of the term` customer' it is clear that the accused device lacks this essential limitation
sabrevision is not used by nor is it designed to be used by the customers who are purchasing the goods and services
lockwood does not genuinely dispute americans contention that sabrevision uses a command structure that requires experience to operate nor does he argue that sabrevision is suitable for self-service operation by the consumers of the travel related goods and services

finally lockwood argues that a genuine_issue of fact was raised regarding whether sabrevision has a structure equivalent to the disclosed structures relating to the claimed` means for accepting payment'
with sabrevision a travel_agent enters credit card information through the keyboard which does not contain a magnetic card_reader as disclosed in the patent
american argues that as a matter of law a keyboard which requires manual_labor is not equivalent to a card_reader
lockwood replies that the card_reader also requires manual_labor ; the user must pass the card through the reader
even if sabrevisions keyboard were arguably structurally equivalent to the card_reader disclosed in the specification we disagree that this would raise a genuine_issue of material_fact
we have already determined that the district_court correctly concluded that at least three limitations in claim 11 are not found in the accused device
any error with regard to the presence or absence of additional limitations would be harmless
thus any dispute relating to those limitations is immaterial
accordingly we conclude that the district_court did not err in holding that as a matter of law sabrevision does not literally infringe claim 11

lockwood also argues that the district_court erred in concluding on summary_judgment that there was no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
lockwood first argues that the district_court impermissibly imposed an equitable_threshold before applying the doctrine
because the court proceeded to apply the doctrine notwithstanding its statements regarding equitable factors see hebert v. lisle corp. 99_f.3d_1109 1117 40_uspq2d_1611 1616 fed.cir.1996` as discussed in hilton davis [ chemical co. v. warner-jenkinson co. ] 62 f.3d [ 1512 ] at 1521 35 uspq2d [ 1641 ] at 1647-48 [ fed.cir.1995 ] infringement by technologic equivalents like literal infringement does not have an equitable_threshold
`` this error was harmless
after analyzing the prosecution_history the court correctly concluded that prosecution_history_estoppel_precludes a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents

prosecution history estoppel precludes a patentee from obtaining in an infringement suit protection for subject_matter which it relinquished during prosecution in order to obtain allowance of the claims
zenith lab. inc. v. bristol-myers squibb co. 19_f.3d_1418 1424 30_uspq2d_1285 1290 fed.cir.1994
`` whenever prosecution_history estoppel is invoked as a limitation to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents a close examination must be made as to not only what was surrendered but also the reason for such a surrender
`` insta-foam prods. inc. v. universal foam sys. inc. 906_f.2d_698 703 15_uspq2d_1295 1298 fed.cir.1990 quoting *1575 bayer aktiengesellschaft v. duphar int l research b.v. 738_f.2d_1237 1243 222_uspq_649 653 fed.cir.1984

during prosecution lockwood stressed the` audio-visual_means' limitation to overcome a rejection over the prior_art
as noted by the district_court lockwood distinguished his invention from another prior_art_patent which used an alpha-numeric display stating that it` does not feature any means to promote the goods or services by audio or audio-visual_means'
lockwood did not draw a distinction between alpha-numeric displays and graphical displays
rather he drew a distinction between purely visual displays and those that contained audio as well
thus lockwood is estopped from asserting that the sabrevision display which does not produce audio or audio-visual presentations is equivalent to his audio-visual_means

lockwood makes similar arguments challenging the district_courts construction of the terms` customer' and` audio-visual' in the359_patent
we find these arguments equally unpersuasive
the claims of the359_patent explicitly state that the audio-visual_means comprises means for` transmitting a selected sequence of said stored information to a customer' and that the stored information is` a sequence of audio and video_information'
clearly the claims require that both video and audio information be presented to the customer

in addition the359_patent specification states that an object of the invention is to dispense` services to the general public on a self-service basis from remote terminals'
an additional object of the invention is to provide services` by means of [ a ] simulated personal interview with a factitious agent created by audio-visual devices from prerecorded sound images and synthesized data'
the terminal is programmed to` audiovisually elicit from the customer the information necessary to provide an insurance quotation' thereby saving time and money because` the companies do not have to provide so many sales_personnel to deal with such multitude of queries on a one-to-one basis'
although` [ r ] eferences to a preferred embodiment such as those often present in a specification are not claim limitations' laitram corp. v. cambridge wire cloth co. 863_f.2d_855 865 9_uspq2d_1289 1299 fed.cir.1988` [ w ] e look to the specification for assistance in construing a claim'
carroll_touch inc. v. electro mechanical sys. inc. 15_f.3d_1573 1577 27_uspq2d_1836 1840 fed.cir.1993
as with the115_patent this specification clearly indicates that the term` customer' refers to the prospective purchaser of the services and excludes the sales agent whom the invention is intended to replace
accordingly the district_court correctly held as a matter of law that sabrevision does not infringe the359_patent

likewise the district_court correctly concluded that prosecution_history_estoppel_precludes a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents
during prosecution lockwood explicitly distinguished the prior_art stating` [ t ] his system is thus not simply a self-service sales center linked to a central_computer as is known in the prior_art but completely replaces the sales persons role in soliciting the necessary information from the customer'
( emphasis added
lockwood argues that there can be no estoppel because the statement was not made in response to a rejection over the prior_art
we disagree
lockwood made this statement before any claims in the359_patent were allowed
to the extent that prior_art self-service sales centers employed sales_personnel lockwood distinguished his invention on the basis that it did not require any sales_personnel to collect customer_information
the court properly determined that lockwood surrendered coverage by drawing this distinction between his invention and the prior_art
see ekchian v. home depot inc. 104_f.3d_1299 1304 41_uspq2d_1364 1368 fed.cir.1997` [ s ] ince by distinguishing the claimed invention over the prior_art an applicant is indicating what the claims do not cover he is by implication surrendering such protection`
therefore lockwood is estopped from asserting that sabrevision which requires travel_agents to collect customer_information contains an equivalent to the claimed` customer operated input_means'

*1576 lockwood also challenges the district_courts conclusion that sabrevision lacks` automated merchandising apparatus' including` a means for composing and displaying individualized_sales_presentations' and` means for selectively combining' as claimed in the355_patent
lockwood argues that his experts affidavit raised a genuine_issue of material_fact by demonstrating the equivalency between the sabrevision structure and the structure disclosed in the355_patent specification
lockwood does not dispute that a travel_agent when operating sabrevision must manually select and view one photograph at a time from a generated list
the court held that this type of operation is not` composing' a sales presentation within the literal meaning of the claims
the functionality of sabrevision is undisputed
because sabrevision does not perform the functions required by the properly construed claims e.g. it does not` compose' an` individualized sales presentation' within the meaning of the claims there is no need to compare the structure of the accused device to the structure disclosed in the patent
valmont indus. inc. v. reinke mfg co. 983_f.2d_1039 1042 25_uspq2d_1451 1454 fed.cir.1993` the accused device must.. perform the identical function as specified in the claims'
thus no doctrine of equivalents issue having been raised the district_court correctly held as a matter of law that sabrevision does not infringe the claims of the355_patent

conclusion
the district_court correctly concluded that the359_patent was invalid as obvious and that the355_patent was invalid as anticipated by the359_patent
in addition the district_court correctly concluded that there were no genuine disputes over any issues of material_fact and correctly concluded that american_airlines sabrevision_reservation_system did not infringe any of the patents in suit as a matter of law
accordingly the judgment of the district_court in favor of american_airlines is affirmed

affirmed
