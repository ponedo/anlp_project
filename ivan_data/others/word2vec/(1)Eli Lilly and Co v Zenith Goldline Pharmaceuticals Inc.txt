before discovery of olanzapine lilly discovered other drugs in the same_family of compounds thienobenzodiazepines namely clozapine flumezapine ethyl flumezapine and ethyl olanzapine a.k.a
compound_¡¬222
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 831-33
these compounds share a common structural nucleus as thienobenzodiazepines namely a piperazine_ring r a benzene_ring r1 and a thiophene_ring r2

?
lilly used clozapine to treat some forms of schizophrenia in the late ¡¬ 60s and early ¡¬70s
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 831
clozapine was thus the first` atypical' antipsychotic drug
structurally olanzapine differs from clozapine in that olanzapine has a methyl-substituted thiophene_ring in place of the benzene_ring in clozapine
id.at 846-47
olanzapine also has hydrogen in place of the chlorine on its benzene_ring
id.at 847
despite its advantages researchers discovered in 1975 that clozapine caused an often fatal blood disorder agranulocytosis in one percent of patients
for that reason lilly withdrew clozapine from the market
id
nevertheless after a general failure to replace clozapine reflected by many documented reports of promising compounds that failed either for lack of efficacy or toxic side-effects the fda in late 1989 approved clozapine with careful blood-monitoring
id.at 832

until discovery of olanzapine researchers attributed the efficacy of clozapine and typical antipsychotics to their` neuroleptic_substituent' -an electron-withdrawing group considered important to the antipsychotic_activity of the compounds
id
halogen-a fluorine f or chlorine cl atom-is such an electron withdrawing group
id.at 832 850

olanzapine does not have a halogen_atom i.e
a fluorine f or chlorine cl atom
instead it has a hydrogen_atom h which is not an electron withdrawing or electronegative group
id.at 850

?
*1375 the prior_art to olanzapine includes ethyl flumezapine and flumezapine both disclosed in u.s._patent_no._4115,574 ¡¬574_patent that issued in 1978
the prior_art also includes ethyl olanzapine a.k.a
compound_¡¬222
ethyl flumezapine caused widespread blood problems in dogs
id.at 847
flumezapine caused extra-pyramidal symptoms eps and an increase in liver_enzymes and a muscle enzyme called creatine phosphokinase cpk
ethyl olanzapine caused a significant increase in cholesterol in female beagle dogs
id
thus the prior_art to olanzapine had significant detrimental side effects

olanzapine differs structurally from flumezapine by substitution of a hydrogen_atom h for the fluorine_atom f in flumezapine at the 7-position of the benzene_ring
id

?
olanzapine differs structurally from ethyl flumezapine by replacement of the fluorine_atom f and ethyl group ch2ch3 in ethyl flumezapine with a hydrogen_atom h and methyl_group ch3 respectively
id

?
olanzapine differs structurally from its ethyl analog compound_¡¬222 ethyl olanzapine by replacement of the ethyl group ch2ch3 with a methyl_group ch3 at the 2-position of the thiophene_ring

the trial_court found that the defendants did not prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 1 2 3 7 8 and 15 of the ¡¬382_patent were invalid as anticipated under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 922-23
the primary reference the defendants cited for anticipation of these claims is an article entitled` 4-piperazinyl-10h-thieno [ 2,3-b ] [ 1,5 ] benzodiazepines as potential_neuroleptics' from the journal of medicinal chemistry in 1980 chakrabarti 1980a

anticipation is a question of fact including whether or not an element is inherent in the prior_art
see in re schreiber 128_f.3d_1473 1477 fed.cir.1997
therefore this court reviews a finding of anticipation under the clearly erroneous standard
atlas powder co. v. ireco inc. 190_f.3d_1342 1346 fed.cir.1999
to anticipate a prior_art_reference must place the inventive compound or composition in the possession of the public
in re brown 51_c.c.p.a._1254 329_f.2d_1006 1011 1964
thus the prior_art_reference must disclose each and every feature of the claimed invention either explicitly or inherently
glaxo inc. v. novopharm *1376 ltd. 52_f.3d_1043 1047 fed.cir.1995

pointing to in re petering 49_c.c.p.a._993 301_f.2d_676_(1962) and in re schaumann 572_f.2d_312_(c.c.p.a.1987) ivax asserts that chakrabarti 1980a anticipated claim 1 of the ¡¬382_patent because it identified compounds from the same_family of compounds thienobenzodiazepines
indeed in petering the board of patent appeals affirmed the examiners rejection of claims 1 2 4 5 7 and 10-12 of the patent applicants application on` isoalloxazines'
301 f.2d at 677
however in contrast to this case the prior_art in petering did more than make a broad generic disclosure
in petering the prior_art disclosed a limited_number of specific preferences from a specifically defined group of isoalloxazines
id
as a result petering actually disclosed to one skilled in the art a limited_class of only` some 20 compounds' including` 6 7-dimethyl-9- bmonohydroxyethyl -isoalloxazine'
schaumann 572 f.2d at 315 citing petering 301 f.2d at 682

similarly the prior_art in schaumann disclosed 14 compounds later further narrowed to 7 considering express preferences
additionally the structural formula of this prior_art contained but a single variable
572 f.2d at 314
thus in schaumann the prior_art patent embraced a very limited_number of closely related compounds and specifically described the claimed compound
572 f.2d at 316
thus unlike this case the prior_art in both petering and schaumann expressly spelled out a definite and limited_class of compounds that enabled a person of ordinary_skill in the art to at once envisage each member of this limited_class
schaumann 572 f.2d at 315 ; petering 301 f.2d at 681-82

by contrast the number of compounds actually disclosed by chakrabarti 1980a numbers in the millions including all proposed alternative substituents
chakrabarti 1980a examined forty-five specific compounds as opposed to a genus of compounds in the 4-piperazinyl-10h-thieno [ 2,3-b ] [ 1,5 ] benzodiazepine family and fourteen analogous 5-piperazinyl-substituted 4h-thieno [ 2,3-b ] [ 1,4 ] benzodiazepines which were created to compare activity
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 848
indeed chakrabarti 1980a listed several preferred compounds and substituents none of which resemble olanzapine for r-a methyl hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl ; for r1-a fluorine chlorine or 7 8 di-fluoro [ no hydrogen ] ; and
for r2-a methyl 2-ethyl or 2-isopropyl group
id.at 848
five of the preferred individual compounds 9 12 17 29 and 34 are more potent than clozapine scoring a 3 car1 or higher and have clozapine-like effect
for those five preferred compounds the chakrabarti 1980a authors expressed a preference for specific complete_compounds without any variation of the individual_substituents on those molecules
chakrabarti 1980a also always expressed a preference for halogen-containing compounds fluorine or chlorine not hydrogen
id.at 832-33
furthermore compounds 9 12 17 and 29 all have fluorine at the 7-position of the benzene_ring
and though compound 34 does have hydrogen at the 7-position of the benzene_ring it *1377 has a hydroxyethyl on its piperazine_ring unlike olanzapine
id
in sum chakrabarti 1980a discloses nothing close to the claimed invention

chakrabarti 1980a does provide a general structural formula with possible substituents of` r'` r1' and` r2' but it does not define them at all
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 900
no possible combination of those preferred substituents would lead to the components that make up olanzapine because each would contain a fluorine or a chlorine
to make olanzapine from chakrabarti 1980a one would have to depart from the teaching of the article and recombine the components of the specific illustrative compounds with hindsight
thus chakrabarti 1980a does not anticipate because 1 the article prefers complete_compounds not individual_substituents 2 the article discloses no generic disclosure encompassing olanzapine or even stating that substituents on different compounds were interchangeable and 3 the article does not suggest transforming unpreferred compound 72 into a preferred compound
thus chakrabarti 1980a did not place olanzapine in the possession of the public
therefore this court detects no clear_error in the trial_courts finding of no anticipation

ii
the trial_court found that the defendants did not prove by clear and convincing_evidence that claims 1 2 3 7 8 and 15 of the ¡¬382_patent were invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 922-23
on appeal ivax argues that the district_court erred by erecting` a threshold requirement that defendants establish a teaching or incentive to treat the closest prior_art i.e. compound_¡¬222 as alead_compound
`` ivax also charges that the district_court disregarded 1 the structural characteristic of olanzapine as the adjacent_homolog of compound_¡¬222 2 the suggestions to delete fluorine from the prior_art compound flumezapine and 3 the observation that compound_¡¬222 and flumezapine` bracket' olanzapine

this court reviews obviousness without deference as a legal conclusion with underlying factual determinations which are reviewed for clear_error
medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 437_f.3d_1157 1164 fed.cir.2006
the factual underpinnings are 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the differences between the prior_art and the claimed invention at the time of invention 3 the level of ordinary_skill in the art and 4 the objective indicia of nonobviousness
see graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966) ; panduit corp. v. dennison mfg. 810_f.2d_1561 1566-67 fed.cir.1987
for a chemical_compound a prima_facie_case of obviousness requires` structural_similarity between claimed and prior_art subject matter.. where the prior_art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions'
in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692 fed.cir.1990 en banc
`` [ a ] reasonable expectation of success not absolute predictability' supports a conclusion of obviousness
in re longi 759_f.2d_887 896 fed.cir.1985

for the following reasons the district_court did not err in reaching its conclusion
as succinctly stated by the district_court 175
in light of the general state of the art including the teachings of the ¡¬574_patent and chakrabarti 1980a chakrabarti 1982 and chakrabarti *1378 1989 one of ordinary_skill in the art would have expected that replacing the fluorine_atom with a hydrogen_atom would produce a compound without sufficient antipsychotic_activity
nichols tr
2776:5-11
176
while chakrabarti 1980a suggests that a chlorine atom in place of the fluorine_atom would also enhance the compounds activity it does not specifically suggest that the same result could be obtained with a hydrogen_atom
nichols tr
2779 17-24 ; tx 3465_at_879 col. 2
nor does anything in sullivan and franklin suggest the desirability of using a hydrogen_atom at this position
nichols 2776:5-11 ; tx 3161 ; findings of fact ¡± iv
b.i.d
lf one were looking to replace the fluorine one would replace the fluorine with other electronegative groups not hydrogen
tx 1315_at_3172 ; lavoie tr
1572:12-1573:18
indeed the art as a whole teaches directly away from using hydrogen because it is not an electron-withdrawing substituent
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 850 emphases added
though the ¡¬574_patent disclosed compound_¡¬222 the patent expressed a preference for halogen containing compounds and specifically those with a halogenated substituent on the benzene_ring in a location analogous to the chlorine in clozapine
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 845
these teachings do not suggest or make obvious among other_things olanzapines hydrogen component
the prior_art_references at the time of this invention taught away from using a non-halogenated compound as a substituent in the benzene_ring exactly where olanzapine has a hydrogen_atom

furthermore the trial_court found that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would not have chosen compound_¡¬222 as the beginning compound because it contained a hydrogen_atom instead of a halogen_atom which again is not a preferred substituent
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 849-50
in addition the prior_art supplied no motivation to change the 2-ethyl in compound_¡¬222 to a 2-methyl
the prior_art would have instead suggested modification by adding a halogen_atom to supply the neuroleptic_substituent as a trigger for antipsychotic_activity
id
the district_court found that at the relevant time a person with ordinary_skill in the art would not have expected any reasonable chance of success with other clozapine-like compounds
id.at 850-52

and though olanzapine is also the adjacent_homolog of compound_¡¬222 patentability for a chemical_compound does not depend only on structural_similarity
comm r of patents v. deutsche gold-und-silber-scheideanstalt vormals roessler 397_f.2d_656_(d.c.cir.1968)
this court will not ignore a relevant property of a compound in the obviousness calculus
in re lalu 747_f.2d_703_(fed.cir.1984)
when claimed properties differ from the prior_art those differences if unexpected and significant may lead to nonobviousness
in re mehta 52_c.c.p.a._1615 347_f.2d_859_(1965) ; in re grabiak 769_f.2d_729_(fed.cir.1985)
in this case the trial_court noted some structural_similarity of olanzapine and the prior_art but also accounted for the unexpected beneficial properties in olanzapine

this case is similar in many respects to yamanouchi_pharm co. ltd. v. danbury pharmacal inc. 231_f.3d_1339 1344 fed.cir.2000
in yamanouchi this court held that the anda_filer did not show obviousness of the famotidine compound [ the anda_filer ] did not show sufficient motivation for one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of invention to take *1379 any one of the following steps let alone the entire complex combination 1 selecting example 44 as a lead_compound 2 combining the polar tail from example 44 with the substituted heterocycle from tiotidine and 3 substituting the carbamoyl conh2 group in the intermediate compound with a sulfamoyl group so2nh2 to create famotidine
id
likewise in this case the defendants have not shown that a person ordinarily skilled in this art would have selected compound_¡¬222 as a lead_compound because it contained hydrogen rather than fluorine or chlorine
at the time of invention the state of the art would have directed the person of ordinary_skill in the art away from unfluorinated compounds like compound_¡¬ 222
after all the primary example of the state of the art at that time the ¡¬574_patent did not provide any biological data for compound_¡¬222 suggested a preference for halogen-containing compounds and identified a fluorine-containing compound ethyl flumezapine as` particularly active'
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 904
moreover as the trial_court detailed chakrabarti 1980a expressly taught that the addition of a fluorine or chlorine enhanced anti-psychotic activity
it also taught that the unfluorinated compound_¡¬222 was less active than the benchmark compound clozapine
id
thus rather than providing the requisite motivation the prior_art taught away from selecting compound_¡¬222 as a lead_compound for further development

nevertheless citing to an article entitled` in vitro_thiomethylation studies with flumezapine' written by h.r
sullivan and r.b
franklin s & f_article ivax argues that removal of fluorine from flumezapine would have resulted in a default to a hydrogen_atom
h.r
sullivan and r.b
franklin in vitro_thiomethylation studies with flumezapine 13 drug & metabolism disposition 276 1985
to the contrary however the s & f_article says nothing whatsoever about removal of fluorine
specifically the article discusses the metabolism of flumezapine in dogs that produces methylthio_metabolite
id
the s & f_article does not state that flumezapine is toxic or that the methylthio_metabolite could be avoided by replacement of fluorine with hydrogen
as noted by the district_court the s & f_article` does not teach that replacing the fluorine with a hydrogen_atom would stop the formation of the methylthio_metabolite
indeed acetaminophen tylenol the_r a non-fluorinated compound also forms methylthio_metabolite'
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 846-47
the trial_court correctly concluded that nothing in the s & f_article suggested` that a hydrogen_atom in place of the fluorine_atom.. would be desirable.. or that to make such a substitution would avoid the formation of the methylthio_metabolite'
id

beyond the nonobvious selection step the prior_art also did not suggest any of the other modifications necessary to reach olanzapine
thus even if the s & f_article taught what ivax claims the skilled artisan would still need to combine those teachings with compound 34 in chakrabarti 1980a to reach olanzapine
as taught by yamanouchi_pharm co. and other precedent mere identification in the prior_art of each component of a composition does not show that the combination as a whole lacks the necessary attributes for patentability i.e
is obvious
in re kahn 441_f.3d_977 986 fed.cir.2006 citing in re rouffet 149_f.3d_1350 1355 fed.cir.1998
rather to establish a prima_facie_case of obviousness based on a combination of elements in the prior_art the law requires a motivation to select the references and to combine them in the particular claimed manner to reach the claimed invention
*1380 id
in conclusion because flumezapine caused eps in two patients elevations in cpk and a variety of liver_enzymes in a number of patients substantial evidence supports the trial_courts conclusion that the s & f_article would not have led a person of ordinary_skill in the art to believe that flumezapine could be successfully modified with a hydrogen_atom
the district_court correctly concluded that nothing in the s & f_article and chakrabarti 1980a made the combination reached in olanzapine obvious

nonetheless ivax also cites to in re payne 606_f.2d_303_(c.c.p.a_1979) to argue that compound_¡¬222 and flumezapine` bracket' and thereby make olanzapine prima facie obvious
to the contrary payne did not feature prior_art that taught away from making the structural alterations as in this case
in this case the prior_art would have directed one of skill away from making flumezapine and ethyl-olanzapine compound_¡¬222
the` bracket' notion from payne simply characterized the structural_similarity in that case which this court has noted does not control this case

furthermore lilly overcame any prima_facie_case of obviousness
among other_things lilly proved extensive secondary considerations to rebut obviousness
the trial_court found the evidence clearly established four of the five proffered secondary considerations
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 852-74 905-12
lilly established 1 a long-felt and unmet need ; 2 failure of others ; 3 industry_acclaim ; and 4 unexpected results
id
the record shows a long-felt need for a safer less toxic and more effective clozapine-like drug ; a decade or more of failure to find a replacement for clozapine ; a reasonable amount of commercial success for olanzapine ; and a number of awards for olanzapine as indicators of industry_acclaim
id.at 852-53
specifically the trial_court noted a` long-felt but unsolved need for a safe atypical antipsychotic from 1975_until_1990' as well as extensive evidence supporting the other objective criteria
id.at 832-34 906
the trial_court also discussed the unexpected differences between the closest analog compound_¡¬222 and olanzapine most of which focused on olanzapine not raising cholesterol_levels in dogs and a comparison of some humans tests with other similar drugs that raised cpk
id.at 853-73
in sum these objective criteria buttressed the trial_courts conclusion of nonobviousness

iii
the trial_court concluded that lillys clinical_trials of olanzapine were not a public but an experimental use that negated any section 102 bar
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 913-14
under section 102 a person is entitled to a patent unless` the invention was.. in public_use.. in this country more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states'
35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b 2000
public use includes` any [ public ] use of [ the claimed ] invention by a person other than the inventor who is under no limitation restriction or obligation of secrecy to the inventor'

in considering whether a particular use was` public' within the meaning of section 102 b this court considers the policies underlying the bar

iv
drl argues that the district_court erred in not finding inequitable_conduct because if it had looked at the totality of the circumstances the evidence would have shown that lilly intentionally made per se material statements that misled the examiner
`` inequitable_conduct occurs when a patentee breaches his or her duty to the united states patent and trademark office pto ofcandor good faith and honesty
`` warner-lambert co. v. teva pharms
usa inc. 418_f.3d_1326 1342 fed.cir.2005 quoting molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 fed.cir.1995
inequitable_conduct includes affirmative misrepresentations of material facts non-disclosure of material information or submission of false material information coupled with an intent to deceive
see nobelpharma ab v. implant innovations inc. 141_f.3d_1059 1068-71 fed.cir.1998 citing molins 48 f.3d at 1178
to assess inequitable_conduct the trial_court must determine whether the withheld reference meets a threshold_level of materiality
dayco prods. inc. v. total containment inc. 329_f.3d_1358 1362-63 fed.cir.2003 quoting purdue pharma l.p. v. boehringer ingelheim gmbh 237_f.3d_1359 1366 fed.cir.2001
then the trial_court must also determine whether the evidence shows a threshold_level of intent to mislead the pto
see halliburton co. v. schlumberger tech corp. 925_f.2d_1435 1439 fed.cir.1991
after finding the threshold_levels of materiality and intent the trial_court then balances those factors
see molins 48 f.3d at 1178

*1382 gross negligence alone is insufficient to justify an inference of intent to deceive the pto
see kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 fed.cir.1988 ; fmc corp. v. manitowoc co. 835_f.2d_1411 1415_n._9_(fed.cir.1987)
in a case involving an omission of a material_reference to the pto the record must contain clear and convincing_evidence that the applicant made a deliberate decision to withhold a known material_reference
see molins 48 f.3d at 1181
beyond that the applicant must have withheld the material_subject_matter with the intent to deceive
ferring b.v. v. barr labs. inc. 437_f.3d_1181 1190 fed.cir.2006
`` intent to deceive can not be inferred simply from the decision to withhold the reference where the reasons given for the withholding are plausible'

before the swedish_board lilly noted idiosyncratic blood toxicity problems in isolated dogs at 10 mg/kg and drl claims lillys failure to mention this to the pto is inequitable_conduct
however the pto had questions only about blood cholesterol_levels
before the swedish_board lilly never commented about cholesterol_levels
indeed lillys statements to the swedish_board about the idiosyncratic blood toxicity resulted from lillys desire to conduct human_clinical_studies of olanzapine in scandinavia
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 875-76
before allowing human_clinical_studies the swedish_board required lilly to respond to concerns about the toxic effects of olanzapine on blood cells and bone marrow in dogs during the d07290_dog_study
id.at 919-20
lilly replied that these findings of hematoxicity` were believed not to have clinical relevance to humans since the effects occurred at large multiples of the clinical dose'
id.at 875-76
these statements to the swedish_board discounted the results of the blood studies by reference to idiosyncratic hematoxicity not cholesterol problems
thus lilly did not fail to disclose information or contradict its later patentability arguments

furthermore contrary to drls argument dr. david scrubys declaration did not create a` false' impression that the d07290_dog_study cholesterol findings could be extrapolated to humans
dr._scruby had been a staff physician at lilly since 1983
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 882
this court acknowledges that rohm & haas co. v. crystal chem co. 722_f.2d_1556 1571 fed.cir.1983 states` [ t ] here is no room to argue that submission of false affidavits is not material'
in this case however the record shows that dr._scrubys affidavit was not false

dr._scrubys affidavit could only be considered false if read to suggest that dr._scruby was telling the examiner to extrapolate point-by-point to humans olanzapines improved cholesterol_levels in dogs as compared to compound_¡¬ 222
dr._scrubys affidavit does not suggest such an extrapolation of the benefits of olanzapine from dogs to humans
dr._scruby in fact separates into different paragraphs his discussions of olanzapines benefits for cholesterol_levels in humans and the effects of compound_¡¬222 for dogs
furthermore he expressly relies on the declarations of dr. jeffrey means and dr. james symanowski as` the basis for my clinical statements concerning the dog toxicology studies'
dr. means is a pharmacologist and toxicologist ; and dr. symanowski is a statistician
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 837-38

dr._scrubys affidavit appears in the prosecution history as a response after final response for the following propositions 1 that` cholesterol is recognized as a factor in coronary_artery_disease ;' 2 *1383 that the framingham study` indicated that a 1 %_reduction in the cholesterol level results in a 2 %_reduction in coronary_artery_disease ;' and 3 that` there is overwhelming evidence in the literature that serum cholesterol in excess of 240 mg/dl is a significant contributor to the genesis of atherosclerosis'
these statements are not false
the trial_court did not err in discerning no clear and convincing_evidence that dr._scruby misrepresented or withheld information from the pto with an intent to deceive
id.at 883-84

lillys response did not intentionally blur the distinctions between humans and dogs
rather lillys response expressly replied to the examiners request for human clinical comparisons of olanzapine and compound_¡¬222 by stating applicants maintain that the examiners request for human clinical comparison of olanzapine and compound_¡¬222 is inappropriate..
in light of serious consequences associated with artificially altering the balance of cholesterol synthesis applicants assert that human clinical_trials with ¡¬222 would be unethical and well as unreasonable
response at p. 11 emphases added
lilly made clear that it based none of its statements about the effects of either olanzapine or compound_¡¬222 on human testing
furthermore the examiner also understood that the cholesterol data was based on the d07290_dog_study because he asked about those results without any reference to cholesterol benefits for humans
findings of fact and conclusions of law 364 f.supp.2d at 882

in addition on a separate inequitable_conduct question the trial_court concluded that lilly did not omit material_subject_matter from its information disclosure statement in april 1991 which did not disclose the ¡¬574_patent and chakrabarti 1980a
id.at 917
the trial_court also found no clear and convincing_evidence that lilly withheld chakrabarti 1980a or the ¡¬574_patent with an intent to deceive the pto
id.at 917
the trial_court noted that lilly did disclose u.s._patent_no._4115,568 ¡¬568_patent to the pto and specifically explained that` [ t ] he reference fails to disclose the compound which is now claimed but does describe the adjacent_homologue [ compound_¡¬ 222 ]'
id.at 894
it also noted that the technical disclosures of the ¡¬ 574 and ¡¬568_patent s are identical and each discloses the genus of compounds that generically includes olanzapine
moreover lilly cited the british counterpart of the ¡¬574 and ¡¬568_patent s in the olanzapine patent application
in addition the examiner found and relied on chakrabarti 1980a during prosecution
as a result the trial_court did not err in its conclusion that nondisclosure of chakrabarti 1980a or the ¡¬574_patent was neither a material omission nor done with an intent to deceive

v. in conclusion this court affirms the trial_court on anticipation obviousness and public_use questions
because the parties do not dispute the facts this court also affirms the trial_courts legal conclusions on inequitable_conduct finding no abuse of discretion therein
