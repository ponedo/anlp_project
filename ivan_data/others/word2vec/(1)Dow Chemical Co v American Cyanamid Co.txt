opinion
rich circuit_judge
this appeal is from the final judgment of the united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of louisiana 615_f.supp._471 229_uspq_171_(1985) holding that certain claims of plaintiff-appellee dow chemical companys dow u.s
patents no
re 31,430430 reissue_patent no._3994,973973_patent and no._3642,894894_patent are not invalid and were infringed by defendant-appellant american_cyanamid_company cyanamid and that dows u.s._patent_no
re 31,356 the356 reissue_patent is not invalid but was not infringed by cyanamid
the parties do not in this appeal challenge the findings on the infringement issue
we affirm the judgment on the issue of the validity of the claims in suit

i
background
the four patents in suit relate to a chemical_process of using a copper_catalyst to convert an olefinic_nitrile having 3_to_6 carbon_atoms to its corresponding_amide
dow asserted that cyanamid infringed its patents by using a process for catalytically converting acrylonitrile to acrylamide with a copper_catalyst prepared by reducing a combination of copper_compounds

a
the chemistry
acrylonitrile is a commonly produced chemical and its conversion to acrylamide is an extremely valuable commercial process
that process in which water is combined with acrylonitrile to produce acrylamide is known as a` hydration' process more specifically the` hydrolysis' of a nitrile acrylonitrile to its corresponding_amide acrylamide

*618 a nitrile is an organic compound containing a carbon-to-nitrogen triple bond and depending on the rest of the molecule can be classified as either aromatic or aliphatic
aliphatic compounds can be either saturated or unsaturated
a saturated aliphatic compound is one in which all the bonds between the carbon_atoms are single bonds while an unsaturated compound is one in which at least two carbon_atoms are joined by double olefinic or triple acetylenic bonds
acrylonitrile is an unsaturated aliphatic nitrile more specifically an olefinic_nitrile expressed by the chemical formula ch2 = ch ? c = n

in the hydrolysis or hydration of acrylonitrile to acrylamide a molecule of water reacts with the nitrile group of the acrylonitrile molecule to form acrylamide ch 2 = ch ?
cohn 2
the conventional industrial method of producing acrylamide involves mixing acrylonitrile with sulfuric acid and water to form acrylamide sulfate which is then decomposed to acrylamide by reaction with ammonia resulting in the formation of the by-product ammonium sulfate as well as acrylamide
the process now used by both dow and cyanamid however involves contacting the acrylonitrile with water in the presence of a copper_catalyst thereby forming acrylamide directly without the formation of any by-products

for the purposes of this appeal cyanamid apparently concedes that its method for producing acrylamide would infringe the dow_patents
cyanamid contends however that the dow_patents are invalid for claiming` unpatentably obvious' subject_matter arguing that one of ordinary_skill in the art who would be a ph.d. chemist with industrial experience having knowledge of the prior_art would have predicted and expected that certain copper_catalysts which had been employed generally in the nitrile conversion process would also convert acrylonitrile to its corresponding_amide

the chemical_process at issue is generally similar to the process that was at issue in standard_oil company v. american_cyanamid_company 774_f.2d_448 227_uspq_293_(fed.cir.1985) standard_oil
in that case this court affirmed a decision of judge george arceneaux of the same united_states_district_court for the eastern_district of louisiana holding claim 2 of standard_oils u.s._patent_no
re 25,525 the greene_patent invalid for obviousness
the greene_patent also claimed a process for converting acrylonitrile to acrylamide using a different copper_catalyst
in the standard_oil_case the district_court relied on two prior_art references in support of its conclusion
those references were u.s._patent_no._1891,055 issued in 1932 to walter reppe the reppe_patent and a series of articles written by dr. kenichi watanabe the watanabe_articles
those same two references along with the greene_patent and u.s._patent_no._3669,639 issued to louis haefele in 1968 the haefele_patent constitute the principal prior_art which cyanamid here asserts renders the dow_patents in suit invalid

we note additionally that although the standard_oil_case and this one involve generally similar conversion processes-acrylonitrile to acrylamide using a copper_catalyst- the claims patents and records in these cases are dissimilar and thus we are in no way bound by that prior decision

b
the prior art
1
the reppe patent
the reppe_patent no._1891,055 uses copper_catalysts to carry out the hydrogenation the direct addition of hydrogen to the carbon-carbon bond of an unsaturated nitrile to form a saturated nitrile as distinguished from hydration which is the addition of water to the carbon-nitrogen bond of unsaturated_nitriles to form an unsaturated amide
it discloses inter_alia that after hydrogenation and separation of the copper_catalysts from the reaction mixture the saturated nitriles can be converted to their corresponding_amides by the addition of water
example 2 of the reppe_patent discloses the formation of propionitrile a saturated aliphatic nitrile and its corresponding_amide propionamide from crude acrylonitrile using a catalyst prepared by the reduction of copper carbonate

*619 2
the watanabe articles
dr._watanabe published a series of articles1 confirming the efficacy of hydrating aliphatic and aromatic_nitriles to their corresponding_amides using metallic nickel catalysts
dr._watanabe also used metallic_copper_catalysts but with poor_results ; he stated that they were not as useful because of undesirable side reactions
a 1964 watanabe_article reports the details of experiments converting benzonitrile an aromatic_nitrile to benzamide using inter_alia copper_catalysts including precipitated copper copper_oxide and urushibara copper which is a metallic_copper prepared by the reduction of copper chloride
the results of the experiments reported indicated that when the urushibara copper_catalyst was used to convert an aromatic_nitrile to its corresponding_amide the results were unsatisfactory

3
the greene_patent
the u.s. greene_patent no._3381,034 reissued as re 28,525 discloses a homogeneous catalytic system consisting of soluble_copper_ions alone or in combination with metallic_copper ions that will convert aromatic and aliphatic_nitriles to their corresponding_amides
the patent states that metallic_copper alone is not an effective_catalyst for converting acrylonitrile to acrylamide

4
the haefele patent
the haefele u.s. patent no._3366,639 describes the use of large_amounts of the catalyst manganese_dioxide to accomplish the hydration of a variety of nitriles including aromatic aliphatic and olefinic_nitriles to their corresponding_amides
it does not disclose the use of copper or any catalyst other than manganese_dioxide but does state that its process is applicable to production of amides from nitriles in general

c. the patents at issue and their prosecution
all of the dow_patents at issue here are continuations-in-part of an application filed in january of 1969 that eventually matured into u.s._patent_no._3597,481 the481_patent
the four patents that are asserted by dow to be infringed by cyanamid here are continuations-in-part of a june 1969 application that eventually became u.s._patent_no._3631,104 the104_patent which was a continuation-in-part of the481_patent application
the104_patent was reissued as the430 reissue_patent on october 25 1983

1
the430 reissue_patent
the original claims of the104_patent were directed to a process for converting aliphatic_nitriles in general to their corresponding_amides in the presence of a copper_catalyst prepared by reducing various copper_oxides
on february 26 1981 ten years after the104_patent issued dow filed a` no defect' reissue application in which it disclosed several new references to the patent and trademark office pto including the german equivalent of the reppe_patent

in the first office action on the reissue the examiner rejected all claims directed to the hydration of aliphatic_nitriles in general as obvious in view of the german reppe_patent
in response dow conceded that the reppe_patent disclosure might render their broader claims obvious but maintained that it disagreed with the examiners decision
dow proposed limiting the claims to hydration of olefinic_nitriles of 3_to_6 carbon_atoms and the claims were then allowed

claim 26 of the430 reissue_patent the one considered by the district_court reads 26
the process of claim 16 wherein the nitrile is acrylonitrile
claim 16 not in issue reads 16
in the process for converting a nitrile to the corresponding_amide by contacting an olefinic_nitrile of 3_to_6 carbon_atoms in the presence of water with a heterogeneous catalyst the improvement comprising using a cupreous catalyst consisting essentially of reduced copper_oxide reduced copper chromium oxide *620 reduced copper-molybdenum_oxide unreduced copper-molybdenum_oxide or mixtures thereof

2
the894_patent
the first of a number of applications filed by dow as continuations-in-part of the104_patent application issued as the894_patent
claim 6 the one claim considered by the district_court is directed to the same basic process for converting an acrylonitrile to its corresponding_amide
the difference between this claim and claim 26 of the430 reissue_patent is an additional step of` at least partially protecting the reduced catalyst from contact with oxygen after reduction'

3
the973_patent
the973_patent is similar to the430 reissue_patent
claim 13 the only_claim considered by the district_court defines a process for converting an acrylonitrile to its corresponding_amide` in the presence of a catalytic amount of copper prepared by reducing copper_oxide'
the district_court held claim 13 infringed by cyanamid

4
the356 reissue_patent
a fourth dow patent also a continuation-in-part of the application for the104_patent issued september 11 1973 as no._3758,578 the578_patent and was reissued august 23 1983 as the356 reissue_patent
claim 10 the only_claim in suit defines the process of converting acrylonitrile to acrylamide using a copper salt catalyst
the district_court held that claim 10 was not infringed because it found that the catalysts used by cyanamid were prepared by reducing copper_oxides not copper salts

d. the objective evidence of nonobviousness
the record indicates that there was a long-felt need to find a better way to manufacture acrylamide than by the sulfuric_acid_process
dow urges that the shift to a catalytic process by both dow and cyanamid and cyanamids admitted adoption of a process based inter_alia on information gleaned from the dow_patents are both objective factors tending to support the patentability of dows claimed process
cyanamid argues that there was no evidence of nexus between the commercial_success of dows acrylamide business and any aspect of the claimed invention and further urges that the commercial_success enjoyed by both dow and cyanamid was more probably attributable to a market demand for acrylamide

cyanamid conceded that the dow_patents provide one common disclosure to the public of a chemical_process for the conversion of nitriles to amides but noted at trial that the only distinction of dows invention from prior known processes is dows claim limitation to one subgroup of nitriles namely olefinic_nitriles of 3_to_6 carbon_atoms
thus cyanamid asserted that the subject_matter of the patents as a whole would have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time that dows inventions were made
with respect to the obviousness of the claimed invention dow asserted that cyanamids copying of dows process the great need to commercialize the process and the commercial_success enjoyed by dow were compelling evidence of nonobviousness

trial to the district_court sitting without a jury lasted seven days during which time the district_court heard the testimony of one of the dow patentees dr. ben tefertiller as well as two chemical experts on behalf of cyanamid and an expert in the field of patent practice on behalf of dow
the district_court issued its decision including findings of fact and conclusions of law on august 14 1985

ii
the district courts opinion
the only district_court conclusion at issue is the legal question of nonobviousness
in addressing it the district_court first noted the graham inquiries emphasizing objective_evidence of nonobviousness such as long-felt need unexpected results commercial_success and failure of others

the court then turned to an analysis of the prior_art and a comparison of each reference with the claimed invention which the court characterized as` the hydration *621 of acrylonitrile to acrylamide using a reduced_copper_compound as a catalyst'
in discussing the reppe_patent the district_court found that it taught that reduced copper_catalysts are useful for the hydrogenation of unsaturated_nitriles to the corresponding saturated nitriles and that after hydrogenation the saturated nitrile can be converted to an amide by the addition of water
the district_court concluded its analysis by stating that the reppe_patent` does not disclose the hydration of acrylonitrile to acrylamide using a reduced copper_catalyst'

the district_court found that the watanabe_articles indicated that the hydration of aliphatic_nitriles was somewhat different from the hydration of aromatic_nitriles and that metallic_copper_catalysts` gave poor_results as catalysts for hydration'
in addition the court noted that` dr._watanabe taught that the catalysts could be exposed to air during their preparation'
the court concluded with the statement that` [ t ] he reference does not disclose the hydration of acrylonitrile to acrylamide with a reduced_copper_compound as a catalyst'

the district_court acknowledged that the greene_patent` taught that soluble_copper_ions would convert aromatic and aliphatic_nitriles including acrylonitrile to their corresponding_amides' but also found that it stated` that metallic_copper alone was not an effective_catalyst for converting acrylonitrile to acrylamide'
similarly the court noted that the haefele_patent` disclosed the use of large_amounts of manganese_dioxide as a catalyst with an organic solvent to convert nitriles including acrylonitrile to the corresponding_amide' but found that` [ t ] he reference does not disclose the use of a reduced_copper_compound to catalyze the hydration of acrylonitrile to acrylamide'

the court then concluded` that there are differences between the subject_matter claimed by dow in the patent-in-suit [ sic ] and the prior_art when taken as a whole and that such differences would not be [ sic have been ] obvious to those skilled in the art'
the court found those differences to be inter_alia that` the hydration of nitriles by the use of a copper_catalyst obtained through the reduction of a copper_compound was not predictable'
the court also stated that the process claimed in the dow_patents was` limited to the conversion of certain unsaturated_nitriles particularly acrylonitrile to its corresponding unsaturated amide'
the court found that process to be different` from the prior_art in the nature of the nitrile hydrated' because the prior_art showed the hydration of only` saturated and aromatic_nitriles'

finally the district_court acknowledged several secondary considerations to support its conclusion that the dow_patents had not been proven invalid
the court found that dow was able to build a full-size_plant utilizing its patented_invention to replace the sulfuric_acid_process
the court was also impressed by the fact that the dow process` produces high yields of pure acrylamide.. with little or no by-product'
that fact coupled with cyanamids apparent inability to develop its own commercial process based on the prior_art indicated to the court that dows patented_invention would not have been obvious

two weeks later the court issued its judgment holding the430 reissue_patent the894_patent the973_patent and the356 reissue_patent valid and enforceable
the court then held that cyanamid infringed claim 26 of the430 reissue_patent claim 6 of the894_patent and claim 13 of the973_patent and permanently enjoined cyanamid from practicing the processes of those claims.2 the injunction was stayed pending appeal to this court

iii
opinion
the district_court correctly recognized that reppe discloses a process in which *622 unsaturated_nitriles are converted to saturated ones by using a copper_catalyst and in which the saturated nitrile is then converted to its corresponding_amide but without the use of the copper_catalyst as in the claimed inventions
the disclosure is of a two-step process and the district_court acknowledged that distinction in making its graham inquiry.3

the district_court recognized that the watanabe_articles disclose the use of copper_catalysts to successfully convert aromatic and aliphatic_nitriles to their corresponding_amides and watanabes statement that` [ i ] t has been found that the usual catalysts for hydrogenation are generally effective in the hydration of nitriles'
the court found that watanabe did not suggest the use of copper_catalysts to convert acrylonitrile to acrylamide because his results showed that the yields of amide obtained in such a manner were very poor compared to the use of nickel catalysts that copper_catalysts gave unexpected_side_reactions and that some copper_catalysts caused the formation of amines rather than amides all of which would have suggested the undesirability of a process as defined by the claims in issue
there is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that these findings are clearly erroneous and thus we are not convinced that a mistake has been made

the greene_reference shows that a catalyst composed of the combination of soluble_copper_ions and metallic_copper will convert a wide range of nitriles to amides including olefinic_nitriles of 3_to_6 carbon_atoms and specifically including acrylonitrile
that art also explicitly states as found by the district_court that copper_metal alone` is not an effective_catalyst for [ converting a nitrile to its corresponding_amide ]' and to that extent teaches away from the claimed inventions use of copper_metal as a catalyst

the haefele_patent relates only to the use as a catalyst of manganese_dioxide to convert numerous different nitriles
the present case is concerned with copper_catalysts

with regard to objective_evidence of nonobviousness the district_court found that` dows efforts were successful not only scientifically but also commercially in that dow was able to build a full-size_plant utilizing its patented_invention that replaced the sulfuric_acid_process'
the record reflects that this success was possible because the claimed invention unblocked a cost barrier to the market ; it displaced the prior inefficient process burdened with the costs of extra reagents and an ammonium sulfate by-product
while cyanamids argument that dow has not shown that its increase in sales resulted from the claimed invention may be well taken there is other strong objective_evidence of nonobviousness in the record as found by the district_court

the finding that the claimed invention resolved a long-felt need to do away with the wasteful sulfuric_acid_process and its unwanted by-products tends to show the nonobviousness of the claimed invention as does failure of others and copying ; cyanamid tried but failed to develop the claimed invention and copied it instead

based on all of the above we conclude that the subject_matter of the four claims of the four patents in suit would not have been obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time those inventions were made
the reppe prior_art discloses copper_metal_catalysts and hydration but when the distinction between using that copper_catalyst in hydrogenation and not in hydration is made that disclosure is not meaningful to the obviousness of the claimed invention ; in reppe the copper catalyzed the saturation of the carbon-carbon bonds of the nitrile not its hydration to an amide the subject_matter of the claims in suit
the *623 fact that the 1964 watanabe_article states that the usual hydrogenation catalysts are` generally effective' in the hydration of nitriles to amides might suggest the claimed invention when viewed in combination with reppe if it were not for the fact that watanabe also states that copper_metal_catalysts give poor yields and unexpected_side_reactions the first of which the court found the claimed invention excelled in
furthermore taking the greene_reference as a whole in combination with reppe and watanabe we can only conclude that its explicit statement that copper_catalysts were ineffective for use in hydrating nitriles would lead one of ordinary_skill in the art away from the claimed invention
finally the haefele prior_art adds little to the equation of obviousness
lastly the objective_evidence of nonobviousness particularly failure of others and long-felt need lends much to our conclusion that the claimed invention fully satisfies the requirements of 35 u.s.c.¡± 103

iv
conclusion
accordingly the district_courts holding that the claims in suit of the four patents in suit re 31,430 no._3994,973 no._3642,894 and re 31,356 are not invalid is affirmed

affirmed

davis circuit_judge dissenting
i
in my view a contrary result is compelled by this courts earlier decision in standard_oil co. v. american_cyanamid_co. 774_f.2d_448 227_uspq_293_(fed.cir.1985) sohio1 the chemical_process involved here is substantially the same process at issue in sohio although the challenged patents are different
because of the general identity of the chemical_process there are holdings in sohio that bear directly on the correctness of the district_courts decision in this case
the most important of these is our sohio holding that the district_court there correctly` found that the combined teachings [ of the watanabe_article and reppe_patent ] 2 would have indicated to one of ordinary_skill in the art that copper3 was an effective agent for producing a catalysis in the process of converting a nitrile to an amide'
774 f.2d at 455 227 uspq at 298.4 this was a legal determination of obviousness but in the current case judge beer made the precisely contrary determination that` the hydration of nitriles by the use of a copper_catalyst obtained through the reduction of a copper_compound was not predictable and was not obvious'
because sohio is a binding legal precedent on this exact point,5 the district_courts contrary legal holding should not stand
but that erroneous holding of the district_court was a mainstay of its opinion sustaining the validity of the patents at issue in this case

ii
spelling out the matter somewhat further my thought is that the district_court erred as a matter of law in holding that the dow_patents would not have been obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103
the court first discussed each of the pertinent prior_art references separately and on that basis was able to conclude that none of those references specifically disclosed the hydration of acrylonitrile to acrylamide using a reduced_copper_compound
it goes without saying however that it is not necessary *624 under ¡± 103 that each and every element of the claimed invention be disclosed in a prior_art reference
such an analysis is properly addressed only for the issue of anticipation under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102

denied 469_u.s._851 105_s.ct._172 83_l.ed.2d_107_(1984)
rather the proper analysis under ¡± 103 is whether the invention taken as a whole would have been obvious to one skilled in the art
environmental designs ltd. v. union oil co. 713_f.2d_693 698 218_uspq_865 870 fed.cir.1983 cert
denied 464_u.s._1043 104_s.ct._709 79_l.ed.2d_173_(1984)

while the district_court did make two conclusions on obviousness purportedly based on the prior_art considered as a whole to my mind both conclusions must be rejected
first the court decided that the prior_art taught that the hydration of nitriles was not obvious since it was not predictable
as discussed supra this conclusion runs directly contrary to this courts holding in sohio and therefore should not be accepted since it involved the identical prior_art
second the court concluded that the` process claimed in the dow_patents therefore differ from the prior_art in the nature of the nitrile hydrated and the nature of the resultant amide' e.g. acrylonitrile hydrated to acrylamide
this conclusion is unsupported by the district_courts own opinion which acknowledged that the greene_patent u.s
letters patent 3,381,034 taught that a copper_catalyst could be used to convert` aromatic and aliphatic_nitriles including acrylonitriles to their corresponding_amides'

i would reverse the decision of the district_court

it would be inappropriate for a district_court to state in its judgment form that four patents are valid if only one claim of each were asserted and tried
see 35 u.s.c.¡± 282
in this case there is no indication that the four claims tried were stipulated as` representative' and the district_court mentioned but did not specifically rule on cyanamids counterclaim for a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity
the district_court should consider whether its judgment with respect to validity should be recast to limit it to the claims in suit
3
we are not persuaded by dows so-called concession during prosecution that reppe` can be interpreted as disclosing the formation of aliphatic amides from the corresponding aliphatic_nitriles using copper_catalysts' because this evidence is ambiguous was before the district_court and we may not redetermine its weight and credibility
