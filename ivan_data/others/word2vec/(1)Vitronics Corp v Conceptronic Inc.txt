michel circuit_judge
vitronics corporation` vitronics' appeals the september 27 1995 order of the united_states_district_court for the district of new_hampshire civil action no._91-696- l entering judgment as a matter of law that vitronics did not prove that conceptronic inc.` conceptronic' infringed claim 1 of u.s._patent_no._4654,502` the502_patent`
the appeal was submitted for decision after oral argument on may_8,_1996
because we conclude that the specification of the502_patent dictates a claim_interpretation in accordance with the plaintiffs proposed construction and that so construed the502_patent may have been infringed we reverse the trial_courts decision and remand for further_proceedings

background
the patented invention
vitronics and conceptronic both manufacture ovens used in the production of printed *1579 circuit_boards
the ovens are used to solder electrical devices such as resistors capacitors and integrated circuits to the boards
several methods of soldering devices to boards have been developed ; the502_patent assigned to vitronics is directed to one of those methods

specifically the502_patent is directed to a method for the reflow_soldering of surface mounted devices to a printed circuit_board in which the circuit_board is moved by a conveyor through a multizone oven
in this process a solder_paste is placed on the circuit_board and the devices to be soldered with attached connectors are placed on the paste
the circuit_board is then placed on what is basically a conveyor belt running through an oven and passing through several different heating zones
in the final and hottest zone the solder_paste melts and forms a connection between the device and the circuit_board
the boards remain in the last heating zone for only a short duration allowing the solder to reach a temperature high enough to cause the solder to melt and reflow while maintaining the devices themselves below the solder_reflow_temperature
due to this temperature differential the solder flows up the device connectors to form a solid connection

claim 1 of the502_patent the only claim at issue in this appeal reads as follows with added emphasis on the disputed terms 1
a method for reflow_soldering of surface mounted devices to a printed circuit_board comprising moving a printed circuit_board having solder and devices disposed on a surface thereof through a first zone and in close_proximity to a first emitting surface of at least one nonfocused infrared_panel_emitter said first emitting surface being at a first_panel_temperature ; moving said board through a second zone and in close_proximity to a second emitting surface of at least one nonfocused infrared_panel_emitter said second emitting surface being at a second_panel_temperature lower than said first_panel_temperature ; and
moving said board through a third zone and in close_proximity to a third emitting surface of at least one nonfocused infrared_panel_emitter said third emitting surface being at a third panel temperature higher than said second_panel_temperature said third emitting surface heating said board and said solder to a solder_reflow_temperature for a period of time sufficient to cause said solder to reflow and solder said devices to said board while maintaining the temperature of said devices below said solder_reflow_temperature

proceedings before the district_court
this action was brought on november 26 1991 by vitronics against conceptronic for infringement of both the502_patent and u.s._patent_no._4833,301` the301_patent`1 at the time the suit was filed conceptronic was selling the` mark_series' line of ovens
conceptronic later discontinued the mark_series and began selling the` hvc_series' line of ovens
prior to trial the parties stipulated that every limitation of claim 1 of the502_patent was met by the hvc_series of ovens except the limitation requiring the utilization of` nonfocused infrared_panel_emitters' and the limitation that the temperature of the devices must be maintained below the` solder_reflow_temperature
`` 2

vitronics by way of a request for a jury_instruction asked the court to construe the meaning of the` solder_reflow_temperature' limitation
the specific instruction sought by vitronics was as follows in considering the question of whether the502 method_patent has been infringed by the mark and hvc series ovens you have to decide whether in use those ovens maintain the temperature of the devices below the solder_reflow_temperature
the phrase` solder_reflow_temperature' in the502_patent means the temperature reached by the solder during the period it is reflowing during the final stages of the *1580 soldering process sometimes referred to as the` peak solder_reflow_temperature'
it does not mean the` liquidus_temperature' the temperature at which the solder first begins to melt
thus if the temperature of the devices stays below that of the solder the502 method_patent is infringed by the mark and hvc series ovens
thus vitronics contended that as used in the claim solder_reflow_temperature means peak_reflow_temperature i.e. a temperature approximately 20¢X_c above the liquidus_temperature at which the solder is completely melted and moves freely
conceptronic on the other hand contended that solder_reflow_temperature means 183¢X_c i.e. the liquidus_temperature of a particular type of solder known as 63/37 sn/pb solder.3

the district_court delayed construing the disputed language until the close of testimony at which time it ruled in favor of conceptronic and concluded that the term` solder_reflow_temperature' as used in claim 1 refers to 183¢X > > > > > c
vitronics then conceded that the court was required to grant judgment as a matter of law in favor of conceptronic as vitronics had not presented any evidence of infringement under the courts interpretation of solder_reflow_temperature
this appeal followed

claim construction aids before the district_court
in spite of vitronics early request for a jury_instruction on the proper claim_construction the district_court delayed announcing its claim_construction until hearing all the evidence put forth at trial
during trial and in their briefs to the district_court in support of their respective claim_constructions the parties discussed the patent_specification expert_testimony prior testimony and writings of vitronics and its employees and technical references
the most pertinent materials are discussed below

the patent specification
vitronics relied heavily upon the patent itself to support its asserted claim_construction
although vitronics conceded that the term` solder_reflow_temperature' may be ambiguous when considered in isolation it argued that the specification clearly shows that as used in the claim solder_reflow_temperature means peak_reflow_temperature rather than the liquidus_temperature
in particular vitronics pointed to that part of the specification that describes a preferred_embodiment a preferred_embodiment of the invention for reflow_soldering of surface mounted devices to printed circuit_boards will now be described
the printed circuit_boards are typically made of epoxy-glass such as fire retardant 4 fr-4 or polyamide glass
these boards typically degrade above temperatures of 225¢X_c. the solder may be for example 60/40 sn/pb 63/37 sn/pb or 62/36/2 sn/pb/ag all of which have a liquidus_temperature i.e
begin to melt of about 190¢X_c. and a peak_reflow_temperature of about 210¢X-218¢X_c. thus to effect reflow_soldering without damaging the board the solder must be allowed to reach a temperature of at least 210¢X_c. but the board can not reach a temperature of 225¢X_c

.
.
.
.
.
the board is then sent into a fifth_zone 5 to bring the temperature of the board up to a temperature of approximately 210¢X_c. the devices up to approximately 195¢X_c. and the solder up to approximately 210¢X > > > > > c. for a period of time of from about 10 to about 20 seconds to cause the solder to flow
because the devices are cooler than the board the solder flows up the devices..
the board spends approximately 60 seconds in the fifth_zone but only about 10_to_20 seconds at 210¢X_c. thus the board is at the solder_reflow_temperature for only a short period of time and the *1581 devices never reach the solder_reflow_temperature
vitronics pointed out that in the example described as the preferred_embodiment the temperature of the solder is raised to 210¢X_c the peak_reflow_temperature and the temperature of the devices is raised to 195¢X > > > > > c 5¢X above the 190¢X_c liquidus_temperature
thus as argued by vitronics the term` solder_reflow_temperature' must be construed so that it refers to the peak_reflow_temperature because the claim requires that the temperature of the devices be maintained below` said solder_reflow_temperature' ; if solder_reflow_temperature were construed to refer to liquidus_temperature the preferred_embodiment would not be covered by the patent_claims

expert testimony
conceptronic relied heavily on the expert_testimony of dr._rothe
dr._rothe testified that the meaning of the term` solder_reflow_temperature' in claim 1 is synonymous with liquidus_temperature
dr._rothe further testified that the solder_reflow_temperature for 63/37 sn/pb is 183¢X_c. dr._rothe likewise testified at trial that several technical articles written by those skilled in the art supported his view that solder_reflow_temperature refers to liquidus_temperature

the testimony of mr._hall
conceptronic also relied on the testimony of mr._hall the chief engineer at vitronics
at trial mr._hall confirmed that during his deposition he had testified that the reflow_temperature of solder was 183¢X > c. mr._hall also testified that during his deposition he had used solder_reflow_temperature to refer to liquidus_temperature
however at another point in his trial testimony hall explained that while in his earlier deposition testimony he had used solder_reflow_temperature to refer to liquidus_temperature he did not suggest that was how the term was used in the patent
rather hall testified the patent uses the term to refer to the peak_reflow_temperature

paper written by former vitronics employee
conceptronic also introduced into evidence a paper written by phillip_zarrow a former employee of vitronics defining solder_reflow_temperature in the following manner` as the temperature of the solder_paste on the interconnect passes the solder alloys melting point and the solder enters a molten state the assembly enters the reflow region of the process
for 63 sn/37 pb a eutectic solder and the most common smt alloy reflow occurs at 183¢Xc'
phillip_zarrow convection/infrared and convection dominant reflow soldering of fine pitch smt devices ¡± 10.3.3 1994
however that same paper later describes the solder reflow process as taking the temperature of the solder above liquidus` most solder manufacturers recommend bringing the interconnection temperature approximately 15_to_25 ¢Xc above the alloy melting point to achieve full liquidus and assure good solder flow and aid fillet formation'
id

memorandum of plaintiff vitronics corporation in opposition to motion for summary_judgment of defendant conceptronic corporation and in support of plaintiffs cross-motion for summary_judgment of patent validity and infringement
in its brief supporting its proposed construction of claim 1 both at the trial_court level and here on appeal conceptronic similarly relied on a memorandum written by vitronics which contains the following language` tin/lead solders commonly used by the electronic products industry have aliquidus orreflow temperature in the order of 183¢X_c or about 361¢X f.' however this phrase is in the background section of the memorandum and later in the same memorandum vitronics discussed the issue of infringement as being whether the temperature of the devices was maintained below` the temperatures of the leads at which the solder is reflowing'

without indicating which evidence it relied upon the district_court simply ruled that solder_reflow_temperature meant 183¢X_c

analysis
the use of intrinsic and extrinsic_evidence in claim construction
a literal patent infringement analysis involves two steps the proper_construction *1582 of the asserted claim and a determination as to whether the accused method or product infringes the asserted claim as properly construed
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 976 34_uspq2d_1321 1326 fed.cir.1995 in banc affd 517_u.s._370 -- -- 116_s.ct._1384 1393 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996) ; hormone research found. inc. v. genentech inc. 904_f.2d_1558 1562 15_uspq2d_1039 1042 fed.cir.1990 cert
dismissed 499_u.s._955 111_s.ct._1434 113_l.ed.2d_485_(1991)
the first step claim_construction is a matter of law which we review de novo
markman 52 f.3d at 979 34 uspq2d at 1329
claim construction is the only step in the infringement analysis at issue in this appeal.4

in determining the proper_construction of a claim the court has numerous sources that it may properly utilize for guidance
these sources have been detailed in our previous opinions as discussed below and include both intrinsic_evidence e.g. the patent_specification and file_history and extrinsic_evidence e.g. expert_testimony

it is well-settled that in interpreting an asserted claim the court should look first to the intrinsic_evidence of record i.e. the patent itself including the claims the specification and if in evidence the prosecution_history
see markman 52 f.3d at 979 34 uspq2d at 1329
such intrinsic_evidence is the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim_language

first we look to the words of the claims themselves both asserted and nonasserted to define the scope of the patented_invention
see bell communications research inc. v. vitalink communications corp. 55_f.3d_615 620 34_uspq2d_1816 1819 fed.cir.1995
although words in a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning a patentee may choose to be his own_lexicographer and use terms in a manner other than their ordinary_meaning as long as the special definition of the term is clearly stated in the patent_specification or file_history
hoechst celanese corp. v. bp chems ltd. 78_f.3d_1575 1578 38_uspq2d_1126 1129 fed.cir.1996` a technical term used in a patent_document is interpreted as having the meaning that it would be given by persons experienced in the field of the invention unless it is apparent from the patent and the prosecution_history that the inventor used the term with a different meaning'
( citations omitted ; hormone 904 f.2d at 1563 15 uspq2d at 1043` it is a well-established axiom in patent law that a patentee is free to be his or her own_lexicographer and thus may use terms in a manner contrary to or inconsistent with one or more of their ordinary_meanings'
( citations omitted

thus second it is always necessary to review the specification to determine whether the inventor has used any terms in a manner inconsistent with their ordinary_meaning
the specification acts as a dictionary when it expressly defines terms used in the claims or when it defines terms by implication
markman 52 f.3d at 979 34 uspq2d at 1330
as we have repeatedly stated` [ c ] laims must be read in view of the specification of which they are a part'
id.at 979 52_f.3d_967 34 uspq2d at 1329
the specification contains a written description of the invention which must be clear and complete enough to enable those of ordinary_skill in the art to make and use it
thus the specification is always highly relevant to the claim_construction analysis
usually it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term

third the court may also consider the prosecution_history of the patent if in evidence
id.at 980 52_f.3d_967 34 uspq2d at 1330 ; graham v. john deere 383_u.s._1 33 86_s.ct._684 701-02 15_l.ed.2d_545 148_u.s.p.q._459 473 1966
this history contains the complete record of all the proceedings before the patent and trademark_office including any express representations made by the applicant regarding the scope of the claims
as such the record before the patent and trademark_office is often of critical significance in determining the meaning of the claims
see markman 52 f.3d at 980 34 uspq2d at 1330 ; southwall *1583 tech. inc. v. cardinal ig co. 54_f.3d_1570 1576 34_uspq2d_1673 1676 fed.cir.1995` the prosecution_history limits the interpretation of claim_terms so as to exclude any interpretation that was disclaimed during prosecution'
( citations omitted
included within an analysis of the file_history may be an examination of the prior_art cited therein
autogiro co. of america v. united states 181_ct.cl._55 384_f.2d_391 399 155_uspq_697 704 1967` in its broader use as source material the prior_art cited in the file wrapper gives clues as to what the claims do not cover
``

in most situations an analysis of the intrinsic_evidence alone will resolve any ambiguity in a disputed claim_term
in such circumstances it is improper to rely on extrinsic_evidence
see e.g. pall corp. v. micron separations inc. 66_f.3d_1211 1216 36_uspq2d_1225 1228 fed.cir.1995` in construing the claims we look to the language of the claims the specification and the prosecution_history
extrinsic_evidence may also be considered if needed to assist in determining the meaning or scope of technical terms in the claims'
( citations omitted emphasis added ; hormone 904 f.2d at 1562 15 uspq2d at 1043` claim interpretation involves a review of the specification the prosecution_history the claims including unasserted as well as asserted claims and if necessary other_extrinsic_evidence such as expert_testimony'
( citations omitted emphasis added
in those cases where the public_record unambiguously describes the scope of the patented_invention reliance on any extrinsic_evidence is improper
the claims specification and file_history rather than extrinsic_evidence constitute the public_record of the patentees claim a record on which the public is entitled to rely
in other words competitors are entitled to review the public_record apply the established rules of claim_construction ascertain the scope of the patentees claimed invention and thus design around the claimed invention
see markman 52 f.3d at 978-79 34 uspq2d at 1329
allowing the public_record to be altered or changed by extrinsic_evidence introduced at trial such as expert_testimony would make this right meaningless
see southwall 54 f.3d at 1578 34 uspq2d at 1678` a patentee may not proffer an interpretation for the purposes of litigation that would alter the indisputable public_record consisting of the claims the specification and the prosecution_history and treat the claims as anose of wax
`` quoting senmed inc. v. richard-allan med
indus. inc. 888_f.2d_815 819_n._8 12_uspq2d_1508 1512_n._8_(fed.cir.1989)
the same holds true whether it is the patentee or the alleged infringer who seeks to alter the scope of the claims

the proper construction of the claim term` solder reflow temperature' as can be readily seen from those portions of the specification set forth above the meaning of the disputed term` solder_reflow_temperature' in claim 1 of the502_patent is clear from a reading of the claim itself and the patent_specification
the` peak_reflow_temperature' and` liquidus_temperature' are clearly defined in the specification as having distinctly different meanings
specifically for the solders described in the specification liquidus_temperature is about 190¢X_c and the peak_reflow_temperature is about 210¢X to 218¢X_c. moreover in the preferred_embodiment described in the patent the solder is heated to a temperature of 210¢X_c but the temperature of the devices is maintained at approximately 195¢X_c i.e. below the peak_reflow_temperature 210¢X_c but above the liquidus_temperature 190¢X > > c
therefore in order to be consistent with the specification and preferred_embodiment described therein claim 1 must be construed such that the term` solder_reflow_temperature' means the peak_reflow_temperature rather than the liquidus_temperature
indeed if` solder_reflow_temperature' were defined to mean liquidus_temperature a preferred and indeed only embodiment in the specification would not fall within the scope of the patent_claim
such an interpretation is rarely if ever correct and would require highly persuasive evidentiary support which is wholly absent in this case
see modine mfg co. v. united states int l trade comm n 75_f.3d_1545 1550 37_uspq2d_1609 1612 fed.cir.1996 ; see also hoechst 78 f.3d at 1581 38 uspq2d at 1130` we *1584 share the district_courts view that it is unlikely that an inventor would define the invention in a way that excluded the preferred_embodiment or that persons of skill in this field would read the specification in such a way
``

the district_courts reliance on extrinsic_evidence
since the claim read in light of the patent_specification clearly uses the term` solder_reflow_temperature' to mean the peak_reflow_temperature rather than the liquidus_temperature that should have been the end of the trial_courts analysis.5 only if there were still some genuine ambiguity in the claims after consideration of all available intrinsic_evidence should the trial_court have resorted to extrinsic_evidence such as expert_testimony in order to construe claim 1
moreover even if the judge permissibly decided to hear all the possible evidence before construing the claim the expert_testimony which was inconsistent with the specification and file_history should have been accorded no weight
southwall 54 f.3d at 1578 34 uspq2d at 1678 ; markman 52 f.3d at 983 34 uspq2d at 1333

here the trial_judge considered not only the specification but also expert_testimony and other_extrinsic_evidence such as the paper written by the former vitronics employee
no doubt there will be instances in which intrinsic_evidence is insufficient to enable the court to determine the meaning of the asserted claims and in those instances extrinsic_evidence such as that relied on by the district_court may also properly be relied on to understand the technology and to construe the claims
see markman 52 f.3d at 979 34 uspq2d at 1329
extrinsic_evidence is that evidence which is external to the patent and file_history such as expert_testimony inventor testimony dictionaries and technical_treatises and articles.6 id.at 980 34 uspq2d at 1330
however as we have recently re-emphasized extrinsic_evidence in general and expert_testimony in particular may be used only to help the court come to the proper understanding of the claims ; it may not be used to vary or contradict the claim_language
id.at 981 52_f.3d_967 34 uspq2d at 1331
nor may it contradict the import of other parts of the specification
indeed where the patent_documents are unambiguous expert_testimony regarding the meaning of a claim is entitled to no weight
southwall 54 f.3d at 1578 34 uspq2d at 1678
`` any other rule would be unfair to competitors who must be able to rely on the patent_documents themselves without consideration of expert opinion that then does not even exist in ascertaining the scope of a patentees right to exclude'
id.at 1578 34 uspq2d at 1678-79
nor may the inventors subjective intent as to claim scope when unexpressed in the patent_documents have any effect
such testimony can not guide the court to a proper_interpretation when the patent_documents themselves do so clearly

in addition a court in its discretion may admit and rely on prior_art proffered by one of the parties whether or not cited in the specification or the file_history
this prior_art can often help to demonstrate how a disputed term is used by those skilled in the art
such art may make it unnecessary to rely on expert_testimony and may save much trial time
as compared to expert_testimony which often only indicates what a particular expert believes a term means prior_art references may also be more indicative of what all those skilled in the art generally believe a certain term means
once again however reliance on such evidence is unnecessary and indeed improper when the disputed terms can be understood from a careful reading of the public_record
see kearns v. chrysler corp. 32_f.3d_1541 1547 31_uspq2d_1746 1750 fed.cir.1994
nor may it be used to vary claim_terms from how *1585 they are defined even implicitly in the specification or file_history

unfortunately here the trial_judge did use the extrinsic_evidence to vary or contradict the manifest meaning of the claims
the trial_judge was presented with expert_testimony and other evidence that some of those skilled in the relevant art including certain vitronics employees sometimes used the term` solder_reflow_temperature' and` liquidus_temperature' interchangeably
he apparently relied on this testimony in reaching his conclusion that as used in claim 1 solder_reflow_temperature meant 183¢X > c.7 however regardless of how those skilled in the art would interpret a term in other situations where those of ordinary_skill on a reading of the patent_documents would conclude that the documents preclude the term being given the meaning propounded by the expert witnesses we must give it the meaning indicated by the patentee in the patent_claim specification and file_history
thus expert_testimony tending to show that those skilled in the art would in certain circumstances understand` solder_reflow_temperature' to mean the solder liquidus_temperature is entitled to no weight in light of the clear contrary meaning shown in the specification
see southwall 54 f.3d at 1578 34 uspq2d at 1678` even if southwall could show thatsputter-deposited dielectric has a meaning to one skilled in the art different from the definition in the745 specification and file_history the definition in the patent_documents controls the claim_interpretation`
because the specification clearly and unambiguously defined the disputed term in the claim reliance on this extrinsic_evidence was unnecessary and hence legally incorrect

had the district_court relied on the expert_testimony and other_extrinsic_evidence solely to help it understand the underlying_technology we could not say the district_court was in error
but testimony on the technology is far different from other expert_testimony whether it be of an attorney a technical expert or the inventor on the proper_construction of a disputed claim_term relied on by the district_court in this case
the latter kind of testimony may only be relied upon if the patent_documents taken as a whole are insufficient to enable the court to construe disputed claim_terms
such instances will rarely if ever occur
indeed this case did not present such an instance
even in those rare instances prior_art documents and dictionaries although to a lesser extent are more objective and reliable guides
unlike expert_testimony these sources are accessible to the public in advance of litigation
they are to be preferred over opinion_testimony whether by an attorney or artisan in the field of technology to which the patent is directed
indeed opinion_testimony on claim_construction should be treated with the utmost caution for it is no better than opinion_testimony on the meaning of statutory terms
see markman 52 f.3d at 983 34 uspq2d at 1332-33` first the testimony of markman and his patent attorney on the proper_construction of the claims is entitled to no deference..
this testimony about construction however amounts to no more than legal opinion-it is precisely the process of construction that the court must undertake
``

other issues
conceptronic further argues that even if we were to reverse the district_courts decision regarding the proper_interpretation of the term` solder_reflow_temperature' the district_courts ultimate conclusion of no infringement as a matter of law can still be affirmed on the alternative ground that vitronics evidence does not prove infringement because vitronics failed to test the temperature of all of the various devices on the boards and because certain of the vitronics tests demonstrated that many of the devices reached temperatures above the peak_reflow_temperature
vitronics of course disputes these assertions and points to supporting documentation to the effect that the conceptronic *1586 ovens do indeed maintain the temperature of the devices below peak_reflow_temperature
the trial_court made no decision on this issue
moreover such a determination at this stage would require our weighing substantial but conflicting evidence an impermissible exercise for an appellate court
accordingly we must remand

conclusion
for all the foregoing reasons the judgment of non-infringement as a matter of law is reversed and the case is remanded for further_proceedings consistent with this opinion
