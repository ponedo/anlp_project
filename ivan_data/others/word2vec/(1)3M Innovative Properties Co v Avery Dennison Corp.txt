clevenger circuit_judge
plaintiffs-appellants 3m_innovative_properties_company and minnesota_mining and manufacturing_company collectively` 3m' sued defendant-appellee avery dennison` avery' for infringement of claim 1 of u.s. patent no._5897,930` the ¡¬930_patent` in the united_states_district_court for the district of minnesota
after construing disputed claim_terms the district_court entered summary_judgment in favor of avery concluding that avery did not infringe as a matter of law the ¡¬930_patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents
we reverse the district_courts claim_construction vacate its summary_judgment and remand for further_proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion

i
3m and avery compete in the market for adhesive-based products for the commercial graphics industry
in our increasingly image-suffused world this industry seems to have targeted all available surfaces in public places including the exterior of busses trucks and other vehicles as appropriate locations for advertising images
so that these advertisements may be efficiently and pervasively placed on such diverse surfaces images are pre-printed onto sheets of adhesive-backed film
these films like bumper stickers have release_liners that can be stripped off to reveal a pressure sensitive adhesive just prior to affixation of the image

even one of skill in the art of sticking films on surfaces can experience difficulties
correct positioning of a large image may require repeated adjustments and if the film is not initially placed in precisely the desired position removing the film and repositioning it is likely to damage the film and mar the sought-after image
additionally pockets of air in the form of *1368 bubbles or blisters may become entrapped between the film and the surface if the two are not mated perfectly

the ¡¬930_patent describes a release_liner that according to 3m avoids these positioning and air-entrapment difficulties
also according to 3m averys ez_film_liner infringes the claims of the ¡¬930_patent in the features it uses to provide these benefits

ii
as implicated in the current litigation the ¡¬930_patent` relates to embossed webs useful as liners for pressure_sensitive_adhesives'
¡¬930_patent col._1,_ll._5-7
when used as a` release_liner' the` embossed web' is the adhesive-protective layer that is removed from the back of the film to expose the adhesive
more specifically the ¡¬930_patent addresses embossed webs that are manufactured with a particular type of three-dimensional configuration or` topography' that are useful insofar as they fashion an obverse topography in the exposed adhesive

only independent product_claim 1 of the ¡¬930_patent is at issue in this appeal and it reads as follows 1
a carrier_web comprising at least one surface that has a multiple embossed pattern having a first embossed pattern and a second embossed pattern wherein the first embossed pattern forms an array of depressions wherein the depressions of the first embossed pattern are in the second embossed pattern wherein the second embossed pattern comprises lands and ridges between the lands and wherein the height of the ridges over the lands ranges from about 3 to about 45 m. emphasis added

in the preferred embodiment the first and second embossed patterns each serves a different function
the` depressions' of the first embossed pattern in the web enhance the films positionability
they result in protruding bumps in the exposed adhesive minimizing the surface area of the initial points of contact between the adhesive and the substrate and increasing the ease with which the image-imprinted film can be positioned after initial contact but before complete adhesion
additionally if nonadhesive granules such as glass beads are placed in the depressions prior to the web being coated with adhesive the granules stick to the adhesive when the liner is removed creating nonadhesive bumps and further increasing positionability
in contrast the` ridges' in between the` lands' of the second embossed pattern in the web result in a network of valleys in the exposed adhesive
because these valleys create channels through which air can flow even after the film has adhered to the substrate air that would otherwise become trapped as air bubbles due to imperfect application of the film can escape

independent method_claim 6 is also relevant to this appeal although 3m does not allege that avery has infringed it
claim 6 provides a method of embossing comprising the steps of a embossing a carrier_web having at least one surface with a first_pattern to create a first_pattern of depressions ; b embossing the surface with a second_pattern to create a second_pattern of depressions comprising lands and ridges ; wherein the depressions created from the first_embossing_step are substantially preserved during the second_embossing_step even though the second_embossing_step superimposes the second_pattern on the depressions created by the first_embossing_step and wherein *1369 the height of the ridges over the land ranges from about 3 to about 45 m

the specification provides several definitions for terms used in claim 1 two of which are relevant here' embossed' means a topography on a web or on tooling having an effective three-dimensional_pattern that generates a difference in surface_planar_dimension in the liner or the tooling
* * *' multiple embossed' means two or more embossing_patterns are superimposed on the web to create a complex_pattern of differing depths of embossing
'930_patent col._1,_ll._61-64 col. 2 ll.1-3

iii
averys accused product is its ez film an adhesive-backed graphics film with both positionability and air-egress features
the ez_film_liner is created by first depositing or printing polyurethane` ink' dots the` pu_dots' on top of the liners outer polyethylene layer the` pe_layer' and then embossing a pattern of hexagonal ridges and lands in the liner when the pu/pe combination passes over an embossing_roll
this hexagonal_pattern in the liner creates air-egress-enabling channels in the adhesive_layer when the liner is removed
at some point or points in the manufacturing process the pu_dots are pressed into the pe_layer of the liner.1 when the liner is removed from the adhesive_layer the pu_dots remain affixed to the adhesive creating less-adhesive positionability-enhancing bumps

iv
3m alleges that the avery_ez_film_liner infringes the ¡¬930_patent because the dents in the pe_layer of the liner created when the pu_dots are embedded constitute a` first embossed pattern' the hexagonal_pattern constitutes a` second embossed pattern' and because all remaining claim limitations are satisfied

in its first order the district_court construed claim 1 of the ¡¬930_patent and denied 3ms plea for a preliminary_injunction on the ground among other things that 3m had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement claim
see 3m_innovative_props co. v. avery_dennison_corp. 185_f.supp.2d_1031 1037-41 d.minn.2002` 3m_i`
in a second order ruling on averys motion for summary_judgment of noninfringement the district_court adopted the claim_construction from 3m_i see 3m_innovative_props co. v. avery_dennison_corp. no
civ.01-1781 dsd/fln 2002_wl_31628395 at *3 & n. 2 d.minn
oct.19 2002` 3m_ii` and granted averys motion id.at *7

in 3m_i the district_court construed two terms from claim 1
first construing the term` multiple embossed pattern' the district_court held that` [ w ] hile the language of the claim does not mention the wordsequential it nevertheless illustrates that the termmultiple embossed pattern requires sequential embossments'
185 f.supp.2d at 1038
to arrive at this conclusion *1370 the district_court relied on its view of the plain meaning of` first' and` second' and characterized the definition of` multiple embossed' in the specification as evidence of the claims product-by-process nature
id.at 1038-39
second the court relied on the specifications express definition of the term` embossed' as well as a source that the district_court treated as a technical dictionary,2 to construe it to mean` a topography created on material by impressing a corresponding_inverse_topography on its surface'
id.at 1040-41

in 3m_ii the district_court concluded that the avery_ez_film_liner did not as a matter of law literally infringe claim 1 because the accused product was manufactured using an` embedding' process and the product resulting from such an embedding_process was not` embossed' as per the definition given to that term during claim_construction
3m_ii 2002_wl_31628395 at *4
moreover the pu_dots printed onto the liner were softened during the embedding_process so the pe_layer of the liner was` not the inverse topography of the hardened pu ink dot earlier flexographically printed on the liner'
id.at *5
the district_court also concluded that the avery_ez_film_liner did not as a matter of law infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because` [ t ] he doctrine of equivalents can not be employed in a manner that vitiates a claim limitation' id.at *6 citing scimed life sys. inc. v. advanced cardiovascular sys. 242_f.3d_1337 1347 fed.cir.2001 ; k-2 corp. v. salomon s.a. 191_f.3d_1356 1367 fed.cir.1999 and avery had removed` one of the steps of the ¡¬ 930 patent-thefirst embossed pattern forming an array of depressions' id

v. in entering a summary_judgment of noninfringement the district_court resolved both steps of the infringement inquiry as a matter of law ; on appeal we therefore review both de novo 1 the scope of the patent_claims and 2 the lack of a genuine_issue of material_fact in the conclusion that the device does not contain all of the limitations either literally or by equivalents that are present in the claims
see karlin tech. inc. v. surgical dynamics inc. 177_f.3d_968 970-71 974 fed.cir.1999
in a case such as this one however where the district_courts claim_construction is reversed and a new one is given we frequently remand for the district_court to reconsider the components of the second step-namely whether a genuine_issue of material_fact exists and whether either party is entitled to summary_judgment-using the new claim_construction
see e.g. rexnord corp. v. laitram corp. 274_f.3d_1336 1338 fed.cir.2001

claim construction begins with the language of the claims
see johnson_worldwide_assocs. inc. v. zebco corp. 175_f.3d_985 989 fed.cir.1999
in construing patent_claims there is` aheavy presumption that a claim_term carries its ordinary and customary_meaning' ccs_fitness inc. v. brunswick corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1366 fed.cir.2002 quoting johnson_worldwide_assocs. 175 f.3d at 989 namely its meaning` amongst artisans of ordinary skill in the relevant art at the time of the invention' resqnet.com inc. v. lansa inc. 346_f.3d_1374 1378 fed.cir.2003 citing rexnord 274 f.3d at 1342

a terms ordinary_meaning however must be considered in the context of all intrinsic_evidence namely the claims the specification and the prosecution_history

a
the district_court erred when it defined the term` multiple embossed patterns' to include a limitation that the patterns be created sequentially
the use of the terms` first' and` second' is a common patent-law convention to distinguish between repeated instances of an element or limitation
see e.g. anchor wall sys. inc. v. rockwood retaining walls inc. 340_f.3d_1298 1304 fed.cir.2003 first and second sidewall surfaces ; springs window fashions lp v. novo indus. l.p. 323_f.3d_989 992 fed.cir.2003 first and second opposed ends
in the context of claim 1 the use of the terms` first.. pattern' and` second.. pattern' is equivalent to a reference to` pattern a' and` pattern b' and should not in and of itself impose a serial or temporal limitation onto claim 1

in the specification 3m clearly acted as its own_lexicographer and the definition provided requires only that the` two or more embossing_patterns' be` superimposed'
¡¬930_patent col._2,_ll._1-2
despite averys arguments to the contrary the use of` superimposed' in this definition neither transforms claim 1 into a product-by-process_claim nor even limits the scope of the claim to a serial_method of manufacture ; it describes only the structural_relationship between the embossing_patterns
see websters third new international dictionary 2294 1993 defining` superimposed' as` layered'
furthermore even words of limitation that can connote with equal force a structural characteristic of the product or a process of manufacture are commonly and by default interpreted in their structural sense unless the patentee has demonstrated otherwise
see hazani v. united states int l trade comm n 126_f.3d_1473 1479 fed.cir.1997 concluding that` chemically engraved' was *1372 not a process term ; vanguard prods co. v. parker hannifin corp. 234_f.3d_1370 1372 fed.cir.2000 holding that the claim_term` integral' describes a structural relation not the particular manufacturing process related in the specification ; cf
id
(` a novel product that meets the criteria of patentability is not limited to the process by which it was made'
( citing 3 donald s. chisum chisum on patents ¡± 8.05 at 8-79 2000

nothing in the intrinsic_evidence of the patent requires that a limitation of sequential creation of the` multiple embossed pattern' should be included in claim 1
the limitation of serial embossing clearly present in method_claim 6 can not be read into claim 1 ; furthermore method_claim 6 creates new terms-' the first_embossing_step` and` the second_embossing_step` -to carry the serial-embossing limitation
it is true that language in the specification of the ¡¬930_patent recurrently recites serial application of the two patterns
see e.g. ¡¬930_patent col._3,_ll._16-17` an advantage of the present invention is to create a means of sequential manufacturing of articles using different depths of depressions and same or different materials
`` ; id. col._6,_ll._66-67` because the multiple embossings of the web occur sequentially..'
limitations from the specification however can not be imported into the claims and this rule must be strictly enforced in light of the clear definition of` multiple embossed' provided in the specification-a definition devoid of sequential_limitation
furthermore the specification also discloses the option albeit not the preferred option of creating multiple embossed patterns in a single_step
see id. col._2,_ll._11-15` although the multiple_embossing_steps could be combined into a single_step with the design of a suitable tool or mold the advantage of multiple steps is that the depressions formed by the prior step s can be filled with material prior to the subsequent embossing step s
``

a broadening claim amendment made during the prosecution_history of the ¡¬930_patent supports a plain-meaning construction of claim 1 without a sequential-embossment_limitation
as filed in the original_patent_application claim 1 was expressly limited to a` multiple sequentially embossed' web.3 in response to the examiners ¡± 112 ?
2 indefiniteness_rejection 3m amended claim 1 to claim a carrier_web` that has a multiple embossed pattern having a first embossed pattern and a second embossed pattern' referring to definitions of` multiple embossed' and` embossed' that were in the specification at the time of the original_patent_application
the fact that 3m broadened its claims in response to an indefiniteness_rejection and dropped the sequential_limitation is perhaps unusual but it is entirely permissible and the plain language of the claim as issued must control
cf
smith v. snow 294_u.s._1 16 55_s.ct._279 79_l.ed._721_(1935)` it is of no moment that in the course of the proceedings in the patent office the rejection of narrow claims was followed by the allowance of the broader claim 1
`` ; united states v. telectronics inc. 857_f.2d_778 782-83 fed.cir.1988 concluding that adding a limitation to a claim during prosecution and then removing it when the limitation failed to result in allowance of the claim over the prior *1373 art does not permit reading of limitation into claim when the claim issued without it

avery also argues that claim 1 contains a sequential-embossment_limitation because of the arguments that 3m made during prosecution to overcome section 102 b anticipation and section 103 a obviousness rejections by the examiner
to traverse an anticipation rejection of both product_claim 1 and method_claim 8 which eventually issued as method_claim 6 based on references that taught that` two or more adhesives having different properties may be coated into the same recesses' on the web 3m stated that applicants here are claiming two different embossed patterns where the first embossed pattern survives the embossing of the second_pattern
see fig._2 for an illustration of this patentable point
in [ the prior_art reference ] there is only one embossed pattern that can be filled with the same or different adhesives
there are not two embossed patterns as applicants require in claims 1_and_8
the examiner withdrew his objection in response to 3ms argument.4

avery argues that 3m thus expressly disclaimed any patent scope beyond sequential embossment of patterns when it used language pregnant with temporal implications-the first_pattern` survives' the embossing of the second-to traverse the examiners rejections
3ms use of the term` survives' in the prosecution_history however does not constitute the clear and unambiguous_disavowal of claim_scope that is required to read a limitation into an expressly defined term
see middleton 311 f.3d at 1388
to distinguish the prior_art in question 3m needed only to argue as it did in the last two sentences of the quotation above that the ¡¬930_patent claimed` two embossed patterns' rather than` one embossed pattern'
when the patentee has expressly defined a term in the specification and remarks made to distinguish claims from the prior_art are broader than necessary to distinguish the prior_art the full breadth of the remark is not a clear and unambiguous_disavowal of claim_scope as required to depart from the meaning of the term provided in the written description
storage tech corp. v. cisco sys. inc. 329_f.3d_823 833 fed.cir.2003
furthermore figure 2 of the ¡¬930_patent to which 3m directed the examiner illustrates only the coexistence of two distinct patterns in the final product not the sequential embossing of the patterns

finally in explaining a subsequent anticipation rejection under section 102 b on the basis of other prior_art the examiner stated that claim 1 was` drafted in the product-by-process format'
3m never responded to this statement during the remainder of the prosecution because the objection was overcome without any need to address whether claim 1 was or was not a product-by-process_claim
in this context the examiners statement does not constitute a clear and unmistakable surrender of claim_scope
see middleton 311 f.3d at 1388
[ p ] rosecution history.. can not be used to limit the scope of a claim unless the applicant took a position before the pto
schwing gmbh v. putzmeister aktiengesellschaft 305_f.3d_1318 1324-25 fed.cir.2002 emphasis added
an applicants silence in response to an examiners characterization of a claim does not reflect the applicants clear *1374 and unmistakable acquiescence to that characterization if the claim is eventually allowed on grounds unrelated to the examiners unrebutted characterization

b
the district_court also erred when it defined the term` embossed' by imposing a limitation related to the process by which the embossed surface is made
see 3m_i 185 f.supp.2d at 1040-41 defining embossed as` a topography created on material by impressing a corresponding_inverse_topography on its surface'
because 3m expressly acted as its own_lexicographer by providing a definition of embossed in the specification the definition in the specification controls the meaning of embossed regardless of any potential conflict with the terms ordinary_meaning as reflected in technical dictionaries
see tex
digital sys. 308 f.3d at 1204 ; rexnord 274 f.3d at 1342

the specification expressly states that` [ e ] mbossed means a topography on a web or on tooling having an effective three-dimensional_pattern that generates a difference in surface_planar_dimension in the liner or the tooling'
¡¬930_patent col._1,_ll._61-64
this definition defines` embossed' materials to include both the web and the tooling a device that can be used to impress a pattern into a web provided each has a` topography' that has` an effective three-dimensional_pattern that generates a difference in surface_planar_dimension
`` 5 this definition is entirely structural
3m defines an` embossed' material as one that has particular surface characteristics a` topography' with an` effective three-dimensional_pattern' the pattern creating` a difference in surface_planar_dimension'

the district_court erred when it introduced a process_limitation of embossed by requiring the topography to be created by impression of a corresponding_inverse_topography
the patent does not limit how the embossed pattern as defined in the specification is created

vi
because the district_court erred in its claim_construction the reasoning underpinning its grant of summary_judgment of noninfringement to avery is no longer relevant
we do not reach the question of infringement under its now-vacated claim_construction
furthermore because the parties have not briefed infringement under our claim_construction and because we can not determine whether sufficient discovery has occurred to rule on infringement-related summary_judgment motions using this courts claim_construction we remand to the district_court for further_proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion

*1375 michel circuit_judge dissenting
i respectfully dissent because i disagree with the majoritys construction of claim 1 as a pure product_claim
the majoritys construction runs counter to the definition of claim_terms chosen by the patentee as well as the analyses of the district_court and the patent examiner both of whom expressly interpreted claim 1 as a product-by-process_claim
the majority incorrectly reads the definition of` multiple embossed' as purely structural when in my view it requires process
moreover the majoritys claim_construction may weaken the notice function of this claim i believe a reasonable competitor would read claim 1 as a product_claim with a process_limitation

claim 1 reads as follows 1
a carrier_web comprising at least one surface that has a multiple embossed pattern having a first embossed pattern and a second embossed pattern wherein the first embossed pattern forms an array of depressions wherein the depressions of the first embossed pattern are in the second embossed pattern wherein the second embossed pattern comprises lands and ridges between the lands and wherein the height of the ridges over the lands ranges from about 3 to about 45 £gm
¡¬30_patent col._9,_ll._32-41 emphasis added
defendant argues that the use of the claim_term` multiple embossed pattern' requires that the carrier_web have undergone embossing in much the same way that a claim_term` welded joint' would mean a joint that results from the process of welding
( red br.at 28
defendant further contends that the required embossing must be sequential i.e. multiple embossing_tools sequentially emboss different patterns onto the carrier_web
although the district_court accepted both of these arguments the majority now rejects both

the written description states' embossed' means a topography on a web or on tooling having an effective three-dimensional_pattern that generates a difference in surface_planar_dimension in the liner or the tooling
...' multiple embossed' means two or more embossing_patterns are superimposed on the web to create a complex_pattern of differing depths of embossing
¡¬930_patent col._1,_ll._61-64 col._2,_ll._1-3
the majority interprets the definition of` multiple embossed' as` neither transform [ ing ] claim 1 into a product-by-process_claim nor even limit [ ing ] the scope of the claim to a serial_method of manufacture ; it describes only the structural_relationship between the embossing_patterns'
( maj. op.at 1371
the majority interprets the definition of` embossed' to be` entirely structural'
( id.at 1374
based on its interpretations of the two definitions-and its correct conclusion that the patentee nowhere clearly disavowed these definitions-the majority construes claim 1 as purely structural

i do not think the definition of` multiple embossed' describes only the structural_relationship between the embossing_patterns
to the contrary the definition expressly requires that an action have taken place` [ m ] ultiple embossed means two or more embossing_patterns are superimposed on the web to create a complex_pattern of differing depths of embossing'
¡¬930_patent col._2,_ll._1-3 emphasis added
the highlighted text is a verb clause-' are superimposed.. to create` -and its inclusion in the definition must be recognized as meaningful

*1376 having concluded that the definition of` multiple embossed' requires process the next issue is what is the meaning of the definitional language` two or more embossing_patterns are superimposed on the web to create..' here i turn to the written descriptions definition of` embossed'` a topography on a web or on tooling having an effective three-dimensional_pattern that generates a difference in surface_planar_dimension in the liner or the tooling'
¡¬930_patent col._1,_ll._61-64 emphasis added
applying this definition i conclude that the` two or more embossing_patterns superimposed on the web' result from two or more_topographies each on a web or on tooling
in the context of embossing of a liner the relevant topographies initially are only on tooling-that is the liner is embossed by tools
thus i interpret the process in the definition of` multiple embossed' as the superimposition of two or more_topographies-each on a tool-onto the web
this process is incorporated as a limitation into claim 1 through the claims use of the term` multiple embossed'

unlike the district_court however i do not view claim 1s process_limitation as necessarily sequential
nothing in the definition of` multiple embossed' compels the conclusion that the tools are applied to the web serially as opposed to simultaneously
moreover i agree with the majority that the prosecution_history and the remainder of the written description do not contain a clear disavowal of a simultaneous application of the embossing_tools
indeed although a sequential process is repeatedly discussed one sentence of the written description clearly contemplates a simultaneous process
¡¬930_patent col._2,_ll._11-12` although the multiple_embossing_steps could be combined into a single_step..'
i therefore do not construe the term` multiple embossed' in claim 1 as requiring the sequential application of embossing_tools

nevertheless because the accused products pattern results from only one embossing tool it is not` multiple embossed'
as it therefore can not infringe i would affirm the summary_judgment of non-infringement even though several of the district_courts constructions-including the sequential requirement-were incorrect
the judgment may stand regardless of these errors because under the correct claim_construction infringement by defendants product can not be shown

because we reverse the district_courts claim_construction we need not review the district_courts conclusion that no genuine_issue of material_fact existed

`` the tappi 1993-1994 technical information sheets defineembossing ascreating a finish or design imparted by compressing a material between matched rigid surfaces or rigid and ductile surface having the desired raised or depressed surface pattern

as initially filed claim 1 read` a carrier_web comprising at least one surface that is multiple sequentially embossed with a pattern wherein depressions created from the prior embossing pattern s are substantially preserved during the subsequent_embossing_pattern s even though the subsequent_embossing_pattern s are superimposed on the depressions from the prior embossing_patterns s'

3m made similar arguments to traverse another anticipation and an obviousness rejection as well

if the district_courts definition were correct then the definition provided in the specification which of course can not be ignored would create a problem of infinite recursion the tooling itself would have to be created` by impressing a corresponding_inverse_topography on [ the toolings ] surface' ; the` corresponding_inverse_topography' that creates the tooling itself a meta-tooling would have to be created` by impressing a corresponding_inverse_topography on [ the meta-toolings ] surface' etc
at oral argument avery argued that the definition in the specification must be ignored because it is nonsensical
cf
ccs_fitness 288 f.3d at 1367 noting that a claim_term will not be given its ordinary_meaning if the term deprives the claim of all clarity
the only interpretation under which the definition of embossed provided in the specification is nonsensical is averys
