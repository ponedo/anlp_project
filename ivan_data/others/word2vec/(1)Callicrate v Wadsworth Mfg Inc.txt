opinion
rader circuit_judge
callicrate is the owner of several patents on methods and apparatuses for castrating large animals like cattle including u.s._patent_no._5236,434 the434_patent ; u.s._patent_no._5997,553 the553_patent ; and u.s._patent_no._5681,329 the329_patent
callicrate initiated suit against wadsworth manufacturing inc. wadsworth on two of these patents in the united_states_district_court for the district of montana asserting that wadsworths eze_no._2 and no._3_castration_tools or use thereof infringed claims 7 11 18 19 22 25 27 and 30 of the329_patent and claims 11-13 16 and 18 of the553_patent
after a jury trial on the merits the jury found all of the asserted claims anticipated obvious and not infringed
the district_court denied callicrates judgment as a matter of law jmol motions on infringement and validity
callicrate v. wadsworth mfg. cv 00-185-m-dwm d.mont
aug._5,_2004 post trial order
because the district_court improperly found that the553 and329_patent s were not entitled to priority back to the434_patent this court reverses the jury_verdict of anticipation and obviousness over an intervening patent
because substantial_evidence does not support the jury_verdict of no infringement this court also reverses that verdict and remands for a trial on damages

i. wadsworth and callicrate are competitors in the manufacture and sale of castration_tools
these tools operate by tensively securing ligature_material around an animals scrotum thereby preventing blood from flowing to the testicles
with time the ligated testicles atrophy and fall from the animal
wadsworth introduced its first` eze' castration_tool the eze_no._1 in 1986
the eze_no._1 is described in u.s. patent no._4691,704 the704_patent
figure 1 depicts an embodiment of this invention

?
*1364 the eze_no._1 can be characterized as a` caulking_gun-type' device because its trigger mechanism moves tightening rod 46 in a manner similar to a caulking_gun
see704_patent col._5,_ll._13-17
this caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism also appears in the eze_no._2 and eze no._3 devices the accused products in this case

after wadsworth began selling the eze_no._1 callicrate identified a number of problems with the device and developed the improved device disclosed in callicrates434_patent
for instance callicrate faulted the` caulking_gun-type' tightening mechanism
as explained in the434_patent [ t ] he process of tightening the loop through successive pulls on the trigger mechanism [ as disclosed in the704_patent ] is time consuming and the animal must therefore be restrained for a longer period of time
in addition the tension which can be imparted to the band and the tightness of the loop are limited by the hand strength of the user
moreover relatively large frictional and abrasive forces are exerted on the band where the band is attached to the tightening rod thereby increasing the likelihood of damage to the elastomeric material causing breakage before the desired tension is achieved
additionally due to the design of the ligature tool an operator is limited in the extent a band can be tightened
once an operator has fully retracted the tightening rod the loops tightness can not be increased
'434_patent col._1,_l._62- col._2,_l._9
to overcome these problems callicrate invented a winding_assembly 14 that performs essentially the same function as wadsworths caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism but in a different manner
see434_patent col._3,_ll._66-68
figure 1 shows an embodiment of this invention

?
the winding_assembly 14 is the only tightening / pulling mechanism claimed in the434_patent
presumably callicrate did not assert the434_patent against wadsworths eze line of products because they do not include such an assembly

unlike the434_patent however callicrates later553 and329_patent s claim tools with a` means for pulling' that encompasses both caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanisms as well as winding_assembly mechanisms
callicrate v. wadsworth mfg. 217_f.supp.2d_1101 1109 d.mont.2002 claim_construction_order noting that wadsworth conceded the claimed` pulling means' covers a winding spool mechanism and a caulking_gun-type_mechanism
claims 11 14_and_16 of the553_patent are representative 11
a tool for ligating a body_part comprising an elongated_tool_body having a forward_end and a rearward_end said rearward_end having a handle and said forward *1365 end having a means for receiving elastomeric_ligature_material ; means for pulling said ligature_material towards said rearward_end of said tool_body said means for pulling interconnected to said tool_body ; and
a lever pivotally mounted on said tool_body for deforming a grommet positioned in said means for receiving
... 14
the tool of claim 11 wherein said means for pulling comprises a means for winding ligature_material said winding_means adjustable to regulate the amount of force communicated by the rotation of said winding_means to regulate the tension of said ligature_material
... 16
the tool as set forth in claim 11 wherein said means for pulling comprises a caulking_gun-type device
'553_patent col._24,_ll._11-21 28-32 38-39 emphases added
faced with this broader claim_language in the553 and329_patent s wadsworth admitted its eze_no._2 and no._3_castration_tools or use thereof with their caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism satisfy every element of the asserted claims
callicrate v. wadsworth mfg. cv-00-185-m-dwm slip op.at 6-8 d.mont
nov._20,_2003 final pre-trial order

despite this admission wadsworth argued at trial that its eze_no._2 and no._3_castration_tools do not infringe the asserted apparatus claims because their components are not connected in the particular manner recited in the claims
wadsworth further argued that use of its eze_no._2 and no._3_castration_tools does not infringe the asserted method claims because a user does not perform all of the claimed steps
the jury ultimately agreed with wadsworth finding none of the asserted claims infringed by the sale or use of the eze_no._2 or no._3_castration_tools

wadsworth also argued that the553 and329_patent s are invalid as anticipated or obvious in view of wadsworths u.s._patent_no._5425,736 the736_patent and the eze_no._2_device disclosed therein
wadsworth however filed the736_patent after callicrates434_patent from which both the329 and553_patent s claim priority
thus the736_patent would not constitute prior_art against the329 and553_patent s if their claims of priority back to the434_patent is valid
on their face these priority claims seem valid because the329_patent is a continuation in part of u.s._patent_no._5403,325 which is a continuation in part of the434_patent
the553_patent in turn is a divisional of u.s._patent_no._5483,095 which is a continuation in part of the329_patent

while admitting the relationship of the553 and329_patent s to the434_patent wadsworth argued that those patents are not entitled to priority back to the434_patent because the434_patent does not satisfy 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 with respect to the caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism
the district_court agreed callicrates failure to include the caulking_gun_mechanism anywhere in the application for the434_patent other than the background section coupled with the disparaging nature of the remarks therein demonstrates that the434_patent does not disclose the use of the caulking_gun
this conclusion is further supported by the limiting definition of the winding_means in claim 5 and the efforts to distinguish the caulking_gun_mechanism in the prosecution_history
though none of the cases cited by the parties is directly on point under the facts the case law supports a finding that the callicrate329 and553_patent s can not claim priority from the filing_date of the callicrate434_patent with respect to the caulking_gun_mechanism
the..736_patent is thus prior_art to *1366 the329 and553_patent s with respect to the caulking feature
callicrate v. wadsworth mfg. cv 00-185-m-dwm slip op.at 13-14 d.mont
dec._3,_2003 summary_judgment_order
based on this reasoning the district_court instructed the jury that the736_patent is prior_art to the553 and329_patent s. the jury then found those patents anticipated by and obvious in view of the736_patent

turning first to the infringement_issue an infringement analysis is a two-step process` first the court determines the scope and meaning of the patent_claims asserted.. [ and second ] the properly construed claims are compared to the allegedly infringing device'

as recently outlined in this courts phillips decision` [ i ] t is abedrock principle of patent law thatthe claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude

the claim_terms`are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning
`` id
( quoting vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996
`` the inquiry into how a person of ordinary_skill in the art understands a claim_term provides an objective baseline from which to begin claim_interpretation'
id
`` importantly the person *1367 of ordinary_skill in the art is deemed to read the claim_term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears but in the context of the entire patent including the specification'
id
thus this court weighs the district_courts claim_interpretation by these standards

in the553_patent the parties dispute two claim_terms 1 a lever for deforming a grommet ; and 2 cutting_means
wadsworths cross appeal additionally challenges the district_courts construction of` pulling means' on the grounds that disclaimer of a caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism during prosecution of the434_patent should carry forward into the329 and553_patent s i.e. that` pulling means' can not cover the disclaimed caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism
however during the district_courts claim_construction proceedings wadsworth did not challenge the district_courts construction of this term and in fact conceded that the claimed` pulling means' covers the caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism
claim_construction_order 217 f.supp.2d at 1109
this concession prevents wadsworth from challenging the district_courts interpretation of` pulling means' on appeal
as such this court does not address whether the district_court properly construed the term` pulling means'
claim 18 contains the two disputed terms in context 18
a tool for ligating a body_part comprising an elongated_tool_body having a forward_end and a rearward_end said rearward_end having a handle and said forward_end having a means for receiving elastomeric_ligature_material ; means for pulling said ligature_material towards said rearward_end of said tool_body said means for pulling interconnected to said tool_body ; and
a lever pivotally mounted on said tool_body for deforming a grommet positioned in said means for receiving ; and
cutting_means for cutting elastomeric_ligature_material said cutting_means operatively attached to said tool
'553_patent col._24,_ll._44-56 emphases added

`` the district_courts claim_construction a matter of law on appeal receives no deference from this court'
nazomi commc'ns inc. v. arm holdings plc 403_f.3d_1364 1367 fed.cir.2005 citing cybor_corp. 138 f.3d at 1454
for the following reasons this court finds that the district_court misconstrued both of the contested terms

lever for deforming a grommet
the district_court construed this term as` a lever pivotally mounted to a ligation tool_body such that the lever pivots about a fulcrum_pin which is substantially perpendicular to the direction in which the preformed endless_loop is pulled during the tightening operation'
claim_construction_order 217 f.supp.2d at 1110
the district_court reached this definition because the preferred_embodiment in the specification speaks` of alever pivotally mounted on the body of the tool
`` id
the claim itself however does not include the specific language limiting the pivotally mounted` lever' to a particular embodiment

the claim_language itself suggests that a` lever pivotally mounted on said tool_body for deforming a grommet' refers to a bar like structure i.e. a lever mounted on the tool_body so that when pivoted during operation it is capable of deforming a grommet
the straightforward mechanical technology and understandable claim_language give that meaning to this term
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1314` in some cases the ordinary meaning of claim_language as understood by a person of skill in *1368 the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges and claim_construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words'
( citing brown v. 3m 265_f.3d_1349 1352 fed.cir.2001

the specification also indicates that the patent applicant did not limit` lever' to the one configuration identified by the district_court
rather the553_patent states in a preferred_embodiment the tool includes a lever which is biased against the grommet located in a receptacle in the receiving_end of the tool
the pressure exerted by the lever prevents the grommet from inadvertently being mispositioned prior to and during the operation of the tool
furthermore when sufficient tension is put on the endless_loop and consequent pressure is applied to the body_part to be severed the lever is used to deform the grommet upon and/or around the endless_loop to secure the loop around the animals body_part
'553_patent col._4,_ll._32-41
this language does not require a fulcrum_pin
nor does this language require a fulcrum_pin substantially perpendicular to the pulling direction of the endless_loop
in sum the claim_language and the specification description are both broader than the district_courts definition for` lever'
while claims are indeed to be construed in light of the specification as in the phillips case itself the district_court in this case improperly imported limitations from the specification into the claims thereby restricting the claims to coverage of a single embodiment
see phillips 415 f.3d at 1312` [ i ] f we once begin to include elements not mentioned in the claim in order to limit such claim.. we should never know where to stop'
( quoting mccarty v. lehigh valley r.r
co. 160_u.s._110 116 16_s.ct._240 40_l.ed._358_(1895) ; see also eolas tech inc. v. microsoft corp. 399_f.3d_1325 1337 fed.cir.2005 commenting that it is improper to limit claims to the preferred_embodiment

in sum when properly construed in the context of the specification this term means a bar like structure i.e
a lever that is mounted on the tool_body so that when pivoted during operation it is capable of deforming a grommet

cutting means
the district_court determined that` cutting_means' invoked means-plus-function_treatment under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6
accordingly the district_court proceeded to identify the corresponding structure in the specification as a cutting device pivotally mounted on the tool
claim_construction_order 217 f.supp.2d at 1110
the district_court defined this limitation as a` cutting mechanism which is pivotally mounted to a tool_body and which will cut ligature_material when pivoted into contact with the ligature_material'
id
while ¡± 112 ?
6 applies to this claim_term the structures disclosed in the553_patent that perform the cutting function do not limit the` cutting_means' as strictly as the district_courts construction

`` this court has established a framework for determining whether the elements of a claim invoke means-plus-function_treatment'

`` if the wordmeans appears in a claim_element in association with a function this court presumes that ¡± 112 6 applies'
id
`` this presumption collapses however if the claim itself recites sufficient structure material or acts to perform the claimed function'
id

in the present_case the district_court correctly noted that the word` means' in the claim_element raises the presumption *1369 that ¡± 112 ?
6 applies
claim_construction_order 217 f.supp.2d at 1110
in addition the district_court correctly determined that the claim_element includes a well delineated function-' cutting elastomeric_ligature_material' -without any recited structure for performing the function
thus the district_court properly determined that ¡± 112 ?
6 applies

`` application of ¡± 112 6 requires identification of the structure in the specification which performs the recited function'
micro chem. 194 f.3d at 1257 citing rodime plc v. seagate tech. inc. 174_f.3d_1294 1302 fed.cir.1999
as noted above the district_court identified a pivotally mounted cutting mechanism as the disclosed structure that performs the cutting function
see553_patent col._12,_ll._18-22 ; claim_construction_order 217 f.supp.2d at 1110
however the553_patent discloses other embodiments for performing the cutting function
specifically the553_patent indicates that` [ a ] ny device for cutting the band 82 may be used [ ]' including a cutting assembly 80 with a razor 88 slidably mounted within a housing 90 or hand-held cutting tools such as scissors and hand-held razors
see553_patent col._11,_l._56- col._12,_l._18
the district_courts construction of this term does not account for these additional embodiments
accounting for all structure in the specification corresponding to the claimed function this term means pivotally mounted cutting mechanisms slidably mounted cutting mechanisms hand-held scissors hand-held razors and of course equivalents of these structures

in addition to the` pulling means' limitation which this court does not address the parties dispute the meaning of two terms in the329_patent 1 a lever for deforming a grommet ; and 2 a preformed endless_loop
this court has already construed the first term
in fact the553_patent has identical claim_language and specification disclosures as the329 with regard to this feature

preformed endless loop
the district_court construed this term to mean` a loop of ligation_material regardless of size having either a unitary circular_structure or formed by joining the ends of a linear length of ligation_material'
claim_construction_order 217 f.supp.2d at 1112
while mostly correct this construction is slightly too broad because it reads out the` preformed' limitation and thus transforms the limitation into simply an` endless_loop'

as described in the summary of the invention a` pre-formed' loop is limited to those loops which are` formed prior to insertion of any band material into a ligation device [ ]'
'329_patent col._2,_ll._63-64
`` [ u ] se of a pre-formed loop.. eliminates the need for cumbersome lengths of ligation_material used in conventional ligation operations and enables an operator to slip pre-formed loops over his/her arms or legs thus facilitating easy access to such loops when performing multiple ligation procedures'
'329_patent col._2,_l._63- col._3,_l._2
thus callicrate expressly defined` pre-formed' in the specification and highlighted the significance of this distinction over other loops
the district_courts interpretation does not limit` preformed endless_loops' to those formed before insertion into the castration_tool
to that degree the district_courts interpretation does not fully reflect the claim_language
see playtex prod. inc. v. procter & gamble co. 400_f.3d_901 909-10 fed.cir.2005 claim_construction was flawed in part because it read` substantially flattened' as` flat' effectively ignoring the` substantially' qualifier in the claim

the district_court properly construed the remaining` endless_loop' portion of this term
accordingly the word` endless' restricts this term to loops without *1370 an end
the329_patent discloses at least two` endless' loop embodiments in figures_13_and_14
as shown in figure 13 one such endless_loop comprises a circle of ligature_material similar to a rubber band

?
unlike the loop of figure 13 which literally has no end figure 14 forms an` endless' loop by joining the ends of a straight length of ligature_material to prevent separation of the two ends

?
'329_patent col._9,_ll._47-53
the loop shown in fig._14 is` endless' despite its two cut ends because it has a substantially circular_structure when tracing a path through the grommet 32 and forward loop 108
the specification describes both of the loops in figures_13_and_14 as` endless'
thus the specification as well supports the district_courts construction which covers both embodiments
addition of the` pre-formed' limitation simply limits the district_courts construction to those` endless_loops' formed before insertion into the castration_tool

the district_court also properly rejected a number of arguments that would construe` preformed endless_loop' more narrowly
for instance the claim_language does not suggest that this term` is confined to a loop that is large enough to pass over the animals scrotal pouch without stretching'
claim_construction_order 217 f.supp.2d at 1111
this argument attempts to read great importance into comments made during prosecution of the329_patent in traversing a rejection over u.s._patent_no._2125,404 the404_patent

a careful reading of the prosecution_history impeaches the argument that the applicant disclaimed and narrowed the` endless_loop' limitation
in an office action dated march_26,_1996 the examiner rejected various_claims in the pending application as anticipated by the404_patent
the404_patent discloses a loop of elastomeric *1371 material attached to a ligation tool with a bow-like structure
callicrate responded to this rejection` the device described by [ the404_patent ] is structurally distinct and considerably different than the claimed invention' and` functions in an entirely distinct way than the present invention.. [ it ] does not teach any method for securing the loop so that it maintains pressure around the body_part of an animal'
these comments highlight differences between the castration_tools
these comments do not however distinguish the preformed endless_loop in the claimed tool from loops in the404_patent
thus this exchange did not disclaim subject matter within the scope of the` endless_loop' limitation

in addition to distinguishing the404_patent by argument callicrate also amended the claims to require the use of a grommet in securing the loop once tightened about a body_part
this amendment limits the amended claims to applications with a grommet or some other` securing_means' as recited in claim 14 ; this prosecution_history does not place any restriction on the size of the loop
in fact the record actually suggests the exact opposite-a loop that is larger than the body_part being ligated would need tightening and securing with some sort of securing_means
otherwise the loop would apply no pressure to the ligated body_part upon removal of the tool
thus the district_court correctly refused to narrow the` endless_loop' limitation

the district_court also correctly rejected an argument that a preformed endless_loop must include a mechanical_connection_device e.g. a grommet attached thereto prior to installation in the castration_tool
the only support for this argument was an amendment during prosecution to claims 1-big_token__6_and_8__big_token -10 of the329_patent which have not been asserted
the applicant amended these claims to traverse a prior_art rejection over u.s._patent_no._2642,057 the057_patent and u.s._patent_no._5459,905 the905_patent
based on this amendment wadsworth argues that the preformed endless_loop recited in claims 7 11 18 19 22 25 27 and 30 of the329_patent should be narrowly construed as having a mechanical_connection_device grommet attached thereto before installation in the castration_tool
this argument however overlooks that claims 1-big_token__6_and_8__big_token -10 claim an entirely different embodiment than the asserted claims
thus the amendments to these claims as the district_court properly observed have nothing to do with the claims asserted by callicrate

to be specific claims 1-big_token__6_and_8__big_token -10 claim an endless ligation loop
they do not claim a castration_tool or use thereof as recited in the asserted claims
during prosecution the329_patent applicant amended claim 1 to specifically claim the loop embodiment shown in figure 14
the amendment distinguished the figure 14 embodiment from loops in the057 and905_patent s. as amended the claim recites a deformable grommet slidably attached to an endless band of ligature_material to form a loop by connecting the ends of the ligature with wire
this amendment was necessary because this focused claim lacked the other novel features of the castration_tool or method of using said tool
nonetheless the claims in the patent without the specific limitations of claim 1 are not necessarily limited to the figure 14 embodiment

of course this court interprets claim_terms consistently throughout various_claims of the same patent
see rexnord corp. v. laitram corp. 274_f.3d_1336 1342 fed.cir.2001
in this case as well this court construes the term` endless_loop' consistently throughout the329_patent
claims 1-big_token__6_and_8__big_token -10 however *1372 contain additional limitations that limit those claims to the specific embodiment shown in figure 14
in contrast asserted claims 7 11 18 19 22 25 27_and_30 broadly claim castration_tools that use endless_loops such as those shown in figure 13 as well as in figure 14
in sum the district_court properly declined to limit the` endless_loop' limitation

method claim 22 also includes language referring to the endless_loop and a grommet
this language however does not limit this claim to preformed endless_loops with a grommet attached before the loop enters the castration_tool
claim 22 recites 22
a method for castrating an animal comprising positioning a preformed endless_loop of elastomeric_ligature_material into a receiving_end of a tool said endless_loop having a forward_end a rearward_end and a grommet attached between said forward_end and said rearword end ; attaching said rearward_end of said endless_loop to a means for pulling said endless_loop ; passing said forward_end of said endless_loop around the scrotum of an animal ; pulling said rearward_end of said endless_loop to cause said forward_end of said endless_loop to constrict around said scrotum of said animal ; and
securing said forward_end of said endless_loop to maintain pressure around said scrotum of said animal
'329_patent col._14,_l._65- col._15,_l._12 emphasis added
the highlighted_language requires that the preformed endless_loop contain a grommet
the claim_language does not compel attachment of that grommet at any particular time
rather the language permits attachment of the grommet even after the preformed endless_loop enters the tool_body
to make this point clear the specification notes a preference for pre-attached grommets but specifically permits grommets attached later
see329_patent col._3,_ll._2-4 ; col._10,_ll._38-43
thus the district_court correctly declined to limit claim 22 to preformed endless_loops with a grommet attached prior to installation in the tool_body

this court next considers whether substantial_evidence supports the jury_verdict that wadsworth does not infringe the asserted claims in the329 and553_patent s. for both patents the district_court instructed the jury that` [ a ] device infringes a patent if it contains each and every element of a patent_claim'
the courts instructions also noted that wadsworth admitted before trial that the eze_no._2 and no._3 devices or use thereof include all of the claim_elements
wadsworth does not dispute this admission on appeal and has not challenged the district_courts jury_instructions
in light of these jury_instructions and wadsworths admission this court detects no basis for the jurys finding of non-infringement
thus the district_court erred in denying jmol to callicrate on infringement of the asserted claims in both patents

moreover this court sees no reason for a new_trial on the infringement_issues even though wadsworth made its admissions based on the district_courts erroneous claim_construction
as to the553_patent the district_courts claim_construction error has no effect because wadsworths admissions were made under a narrower construction than adopted by this court
unlike the553_patent however this court interpreted the claims of the329_patent more narrowly
this court clarified that the` preformed endless_loop' must be` preformed'
the record however shows that this difference also does not warrant a new_trial
the record does not show that this distinction excuses wadsworths products from infringement
see *1373 seachange intern. inc. v. c-cor inc. 413_f.3d_1361 1379 fed.cir.2005` when we determine on appeal that a trial judge has misinterpreted a patent_claim we independently construe the claim to determine its correct meaning and then determine if the facts presented at trial can support the judgment as a matter of law'
( citation omitted
moreover the claims of the553_patent do not contain the` preformed' limitation at all
thus this slight change in the claim_construction would not affect the outcome of the infringement_issue
accordingly this court remands for a determination of infringement damages

iv
the jury also found the329 and553_patent s anticipated by and obvious in view of wadsworths intervening736_patent
the329 and553_patent s however claim priority to the434_patent which was filed before the736_patent
thus if the736 is not prior_art to the329 and553_patent s this court can not sustain the jurys invalidity findings
the736_patent can only qualify as prior_art if the329 and553_patent s can not trace priority back to the434_patent

in the united_states a claim of priority to an earlier filed application s is governed by the provisions of 35 u.s.c.¡± 120
section 120 provides in part an application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by the first_paragraph of section 112 of this title in an application previously filed in the united_states.. shall have the same effect as to such invention as though filed on the date of the prior application if filed before the patenting or abandonment of or termination of proceedings on the first_application or on an application similarly entitled to the benefit of the filing_date of the first_application [ ]
35 u.s.c.¡± 120 effective nov._29,_2000 emphasis added
as indicated in the highlighted_language a` patent may only claim priority to an earlier_application if the earlier_application fulfills the requirements of ¡± 112 first_paragraph
in turn that paragraph requires in part that the applicationshall contain a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using it in such full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains or with which it is most nearly connected to make and use the same

based on these statutory requirements the district_court proceeded to determine whether the434_patent contains an adequate written description and enabling disclosure for the caulking_gun-type_mechanism
ultimately the district_court answered this question in the negative based on its impression that the434_patent did not contain adequate` disclosure' and` support' of the caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism though its opinion fails to mention either the written description_requirement or the enablement_requirement
summary_judgment_order slip op.at 6-14
because the district_courts analysis in the opinion however suggests its inquiry was focused on the enablement_requirement and because the parties have not presented any arguments specific to the written description_requirement this court limits its inquiry to whether or not the enablement_requirement was satisfied in this case

this court reviews enablement as a question of law based on underlying facts
in re wands 858_f.2d_731 735 fed.cir.1988
`` this court reviews the underlying factual findings for clear error and the legal component of enablement without deference'

*1374 in the present_case the district_court determined that the434_patent did not contain adequate` disclosure' or` support' for the use of a caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism for three reasons 1 the only_disclosure of the caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism is in the background_section ; 2 the background_section contains disparaging remarks about this mechanism ; and 3 callicrate distinguished his winding_assembly mechanism from the caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism during prosecution
see summary_judgment_order slip op.at 13-14
these three reasons even in combination do not support the district_courts conclusion of no enablement

first a patent specification may sufficiently enable a feature under ¡± 112 ?
1 even if only the background_section provides the enabling disclosure
see micro chem. 194 f.3d at 1259-60 finding that under a ¡± 112 ?
6 analysis the claims encompass a weigh dump method despite the fact that the only_disclosure of this method was in the background_section ; united_states v. telectronics inc. 857_f.2d_778 785 fed.cir.1988` the test of enablement is whether one reasonably skilled in the art could make or use the invention from disclosures in the patent coupled with information known in the art without undue experimentation'
( emphasis added
indeed if disclosure solely in the background_section were insufficient to satisfy the enablement_requirement of ¡± 112 then the examiner would likely have rejected claim 16 during prosecution of the553_patent for lack of enablement because the only_disclosure of a caulking_gun-type_mechanism being used in a castration_tool embodiment in the553_patent appears in the background_section
see553_patent col._2,_ll._1-22 background_section describing caulking_gun-type_mechanism in depth col._3,_ll._38-43 summary section disclosing pre-formed loop embodiment which may be used with prior_art devices such as a caulking_gun-type_mechanism col._15,_ll._35-39 detailed description section disclosing crimping embodiment in comparison to704_patents elongated crimping rod ; manual of patent examining procedure ¡± 2164.big_token__04_at_2100__big_token -183 8th ed
rev.1 feb. 2003` [ t ] he examiner has the initial burden to establish a reasonable basis to question the enablement provided for the claimed invention'
`` [ i ] f an enablement rejection is appropriate the first office action on the merits should present the best case with all the relevant reasons issues and evidence so that all such rejections can be withdrawn if applicant provides appropriate convincing arguments and/or evidence in rebuttal
``

moreover contrary to the district_courts opinion the background_sections discussion of problems with the caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism does not mean that one of ordinary_skill in the art would not after reading this discussion know how to make and use this feature
indeed this court has stated that disparaging remarks in a background_section or remarks characterizing the prior_art as less effective do not remove those disclosures as enabling references
see micro chem. 194 f.3d at 1260
again if these comments in the background failed to provide an enabling disclosure the examiner would likely have rejected claim 16 during prosecution of the553_patent because these` disparaging' remarks appear in that patent as well
see553_patent col._2,_ll._1-22
here the434329 and553_patent s all identify problems with the caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism but by no means indicate that this mechanism can not perform the tightening / pulling function
accordingly the district_courts reliance on these comments was misplaced

*1375 finally the434_patents prosecution_history is no more dispositive than the noted comments in the background_section
during prosecution the examiner rejected the pending claims over wadsworths704_patent with its caulking_gun-type_tightening_mechanism in view of u.s._patent_no._2487,425 the425_patent
callicrate responded by challenging the motivation to combine these references because the425_patent was non-analogous art
callicrate further argued that even when combined the references do not teach a process that could` achieve quick and tight application of a ligature band to a body_part in accordance with claim 1'
essentially callicrate pointed out the very same problems with these devices that already appeared in the background_section
at no time however did callicrate have any reason to explain how or why the caulking_gun-type_mechanism could not be used as a means for pulling in the434_patent because the pending application did not claim that technology

thus the district_court did not articulate any sound reasons that the434_patent does not enable the caulking_gun-type_mechanism
to the contrary the434_patent specifically referred to that prior_art technology
without any basis in this record to determine that one of skill in the art could not make and use a caulking_gun-type tool with this disclosure this court can not sustain the district_courts nonenablement conclusion
thus the329 and553_patent s may claim priority based on their relationship to the434_patent
the736_patent is therefore not prior_art
because the jury invalidated both the553 and329_patent s over the736_patent as prior_art this verdict can not stand
finally because this court finds in favor of callicrate on this issue the court need not address callicrates arguments in support of its motion for a new_trial on invalidity

wadsworth also argues that the eze_no._2_device itself is prior_art to the553 and329_patent s. however the earliest date in the record regarding the eze_no._2_device is an alleged november 1993 reduction to practice
because november 1993 is after the434_patents december 16 1991 filing_date and the record shows no inventive activity before this date this court also rejects this argument

v. in conclusion because substantial_evidence does not support the jury_verdicts of non-infringement and invalidity of the553 and329_patent s this court reverses those verdicts
the case is remanded to the district_court for a determination of damages
