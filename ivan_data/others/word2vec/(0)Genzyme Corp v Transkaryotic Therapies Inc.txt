rader circuit_judge
the united_states_district_court for the district of delaware determined on summary_judgment that transkaryotic_therapies inc. tkt did not infringe genzyme corporations and mount_sinai_school of medicines collectively genzyme patent on methods of producing the human enzyme £\galactosidase_a
because genzyme can not prove infringement of the properly construed claims this court affirms

i. genzyme corporation is the exclusive licensee of u.s. patent no._5356,804 the ¡¬804_patent issued october 18 1994 and assigned on its face to mount_sinai_school of medicine of new_york_university
the ¡¬804_patent_claims a method of producing human_£\-galactosidase_a £\-gal-a and cells engineered to express and secrete active human_£\-gal-a
administration of the £\-gal_a protein treats patients suffering from fabry disease a condition triggered by a deficiency in this enzyme

the claims at issue in this appeal are independent_claims 1_and_10 of the ¡¬ 804 patent which read as follows emphases added 1
a method for producing human_£\-galactosidase_a comprising a culturing a mammalian_cell containing a chromosomally integrated nucleotide_sequence encoding human_£\-galactosidase_a controlled by a regulatory_sequence that promotes gene_expression and a selectable_marker controlled by the same or different_regulatory_sequence so that the £\-galactosidase_a nucleotide_sequence is stably overexpressed and an enzymatically active_£\-galactosidase_a enzyme is secreted by the mammalian_cell ; and
( b isolating enzymatically active_£\-galactosidase_a enzyme from the mammalian_cell culture
10
a mammalian_cell comprising a chromosomally integrated nucleotide_sequence encoding human_£\-galactosidase_a controlled by a regulatory_sequence that promotes gene_expression and a selectable_marker controlled by the same or different_regulatory_sequence so that the £\-galactosidase_a nucleotide_sequence is stably overexpressed and an enzymatically active_£\-galactosidase_a enzyme is secreted by the mammalian_cell

genzyme filed suit against tkt alleging infringement of the ¡¬804_patent
tkts allegedly infringing product involves a technique known as gene_activation
under this technique a dna_sequence acting as a promoter is inserted into a human_host_cell whereupon the endogenous_human_cellular_gene encoding £\-gal_a is activated to express the endogenous_human_£\-gal_a protein
it is undisputed that tkts technique does not introduce an exogenous_£\-gal_a gene into human_host_cells

the district_court construed independent_claims 1_and_10 of the ¡¬804_patent in a *1097 markman hearing
see markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967_(fed.cir.1995) en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
the trial_court specifically addressed four disputed claim_terms
of these disputed terms the most important is` chromosomally integrated' which the district_court defined to mean` the combining or bringing together or merging of separate_elements' specifically the` chromosome of a host_cell' and` an exogenous_nucleotide_sequence encoding human_£\-galactosidase_a with a promoter and selectable_marker'
genzyme_corp. v. transkaryotic_therapies inc. no._00-677- gms 2001_wl_1530375 at *1 d.del
nov.28 2001

following the markman proceedings both genzyme and tkt moved for summary_judgment on infringement
in its summary_judgment_motion for noninfringement tkt explained that it produces human_£\-gal_a from cells genetically engineered to overproduce this enzyme via gene_activation
tkts gene_activation process permits controlled expression of endogenous_human_£\-gal_a in target cells
tkt argued it does not practice the claimed method because the` chromosomally integrated' limitation requires exogenously introduced gene_sequences a step the gene_activation protocol does not utilize

a week after filing its motion for summary_judgment of infringement genzyme asked the district_court to clarify its interpretation of the claim_term` chromosomally integrated' particularly with respect to the meaning of the phrase` exogenous nucleotide'
the district_court complied with genzymes request stating that the term` exogenous' referred to nucleotide_sequences` exogenous to the host_cell not exogenous to the chromosomal site'
based on this meaning of the term` chromosomally integrated' genzyme conceded it could not prevail on infringement
thereafter the district_court issued an order granting tkts summary_judgment_motion

genzyme timely appealed the district_courts decision arguing that the district_court erred in defining the claim_terms` chromosomally integrated'` regulatory_sequence'` stably' and` comprising'
this court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear genzymes appeal

claim construction is a matter of law which this court reviews without deference

v. cellpro inc. 152_f.3d_1342 1353 fed.cir.1998

'' chromosomally integrated' the dispute in this case turns on the meaning of` chromosomally integrated'
essentially does the term` chromosomally integrated' require the action of inserting a human_£\ a gene into the host_chromosome as argued by tkt or can it cover a gene_activation_technique in which only a promoter_sequence is inserted into a human_host_cell in order to activate the £\ a gene already present in the host_cell as argued by genzyme

the district_court construed` chromosomally integrated' to mean` the combining or bringing together or merging of separate_elements'
further the district_court reasoned` in this case the separate_elements that are combined are the chromosome of the host_cell and an exogenous_nucleotide_sequence encoding human_£\-galactosidase_a with a promoter and selectable_marker'
*1098 genzyme 2001_wl_1530375 at *1 emphasis added
genzyme argues that the claims do not specify the origin of nucleotide_sequences to be inserted into a target cells chromosome
according to genzyme the term` chromosomally integrated' requires only that` a chromosome in the cell must contain a nucleotide_sequence that encodes human_£\-gal_a enzyme'
in other_words genzyme argues this claim_term` requires the £\-gal_a coding_sequence to be located in a chromosome' regardless of whether the coding_sequence originated within the cell or outside the cell
thus genzyme asserts that the district_court impermissibly limited the claim to the preferred_embodiment of integrating an £\-gal_a coding_sequence into a host_cell from an exogenous source

the patent does not expressly define` chromosomally integrated'
rather this court like the district_court must derive the meaning of the term from its usage and context
a fundamental principle for discerning a terms usage is the ordinary and accustomed_meaning of the words amongst artisans of ordinary skill in the relevant_art at the time of invention
see rexnord corp. v. laitram corp. 274_f.3d_1336 1342 fed.cir.2001
indeed normal rules of usage suggest a` heavy presumption' that claim_terms carry their accustomed_meaning in the relevant_community at the relevant_time

of course patent law has acknowledged that a patent_applicant may overcome this presumption by clearly using the words in the specification prosecution_history or both` in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary_meaning'

in other_words a patent_applicant may consistently and clearly use a term in a manner either more or less expansive than its general usage in the relevant_community and thus expand or limit the scope of the term in the context of the patent claims

in ascertaining the accustomed usage of the relevant_community at the relevant_time dictionaries and treatises may serve to inform the courts

standing alone the words` chromosomally integrated' suggest uniting two separate portions of genetic_material to form a more complete or purposeful whole
to one skilled in the art of molecular_biology` integration' generally means` insertion [ of a dna_sequence ] into a host genome as a region covalently linked on either side to the host sequences'
benjamin_lewin genes_iv 812 1990
thus the claim_language suggests incorporation of exogenous genetic code into the chromosomal_material of the host_cell
in context the asserted claims explain that the exogenous sequence has a regulatory_sequence that causes the host_cell to stably overexpress £\-gal_a
the cell then secretes the excess £\-gal_a
again the word` integrated' suggests putting exogenous_nucleotide_sequences into the host_cells chromosome to facilitate this process
this word however does not conclusively evince whether one of skill in the art at the time of the *1099 invention would understand the exogenous_sequences to come from outside the host_cell i.e. a vector or from within the host_cell but outside the critical_chromosome i.e. a transposable_element
in this regard perhaps the best tool to put the claims in proper temporal and technical context is the patent_specification itself

throughout the ¡¬804_patent_specification the applicant consistently uses the term` integrated' to refer to a foreign_gene inserted into a host_cell_chromosome
see e.g. ¡¬804_patent at col._14,_ll._14-19 stable integration of plasmid_dna into host_cell_chromosomes ; col._24,_ll._42-46 transfection of human_sequences into african green monkey kidney cos cells ; col._24,_ll._60-64 transfection of human_sequences into chinese hamster ovary cho cells ; col._25,_ll._1-2 amplification of integrated plasmid_dna in cho_cells ; and col._26,_ll._59-66 transcription of stably integrated vector dna in cho_cells
indeed the multitude of working examples drawings and diagrams of the ¡¬804_patent show the insertion of foreign £\-gal-a coding_sequences into host_cells to generate excessive expression of the protein

notably the` summary of the invention' explicitly states that the` present_invention' not merely a preferred_embodiment` involves the production of large_quantities of human_£\-gal_a by cloning and expressing the £\-gal_a coding_sequence in eukaryotic_host_cell_expression_systems'
¡¬804_patent col._6,_ll._22-30
likewise the abstract of the ¡¬804_patent describes recovery in` good yield' of` recombinant £\-gal_a' from` engineered host_cells'
the patent thus specifically uses` host_cells' to express large_quantities of £\-gal_a
the term` host_cell' means that the cell` hosts' or` receives' genetic_material other than its own to perform its service
see lewin supra at 41 explaining that viruses lack a cellular structure of their own and must infect a` host_cell' to effect replication ; see also bernard r. glick and jack j. pasternak biotechnology 717 2003 defining a` host' to be` [ a ] microorganism organism or cell that maintains a cloning vector' ; chambers dictionary of science and technology 570 peter m.b
walker ed. 1999 defining a` host' as meaning` in molecular_biology that in which a plasmid or virus can replicate'
thus the invention involves` cloning and expressing the £\-gal_a coding_sequence in eukaryotic_host_cell_expression_systems' an explanation one of skill in the art would read as introducing exogenous cloned sequences into a host_cell for expression
this definition of the invention does not embrace targeting or activation of an endogenous_gene

in reading the specification to teach that` chromosomally integrated' means introducing genetic_material exogenous to a host_cell not just a chromosome this court is aware that various portions of the patent vaguely refer to using less than the full endogenous coding_sequence for expressing £\-gal_a
in section 5.1 entitled` the £\-gal_a coding sequence' the patent recites although portions of the coding_sequences may be utilized full length clones i.e. those containing the entire coding region for £\-gal_a may be preferable for expression
'804_patent col._10,_ll._61-63 ; see also col._10,_ll._51-52
in the first_place this passage does not expressly refer to activation of endogenous_genes at all
rather in context this passage merely explains that less than the entire coding_sequence may be used to express a functional £\-gal_a protein

indeed this passage in context explains that this potential abbreviated coding_sequence would come from outside the host *1100 cell
specifically the patent proceeds to explain in section 5.2 that` [ i ] n order to express a biologically active_£\-gal_a the coding_sequence for the enzyme a functional equivalent or a modified sequence as described in section 5.1. supra is inserted into an appropriate eukaryotic expression vector i.e
a vector which contains the necessary elements for transcription and translation of the inserted coding_sequence in appropriate eukaryotic host_cells'
¡¬804_patent at col._12,_ll._35-42 emphasis added
once again the specification emphasizes introduction of exogenous_genetic_material into host_cells

similarly one sentence_fragment taken out of context in column 14 lines 10-14 mentions transforming a host_cell with a controllable dna rather than the entire £\-gal_a sequence` [ h ] ost cells can be transformed with the £\-gal_a or dna controlled by appropriate_expression_control_elements e.g
promoter.. and a selectable_marker'
this reference however falls under the heading` construction of expression vectors and preparation of transfectants'
this entire section refers to creating a vector for` expression of £\-gal_a in the [ chosen ] host_cell'
¡¬804_patent col._13,_ll._11-13 ; see also col._12,_ll._55-58
indeed the sentence preceding the fragment out of context refers expressly to the` introduction of foreign_dna' not targeting of endogenous_dna for long-term high yield production of recombinant_proteins stable_expression is preferred
for example following introduction of foreign_dna engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media and then switched to a selective media
rather than using expression_vectors which contain viral_origins of replication host_cells can be transformed with the £\-gal_a or dna controlled by appropriate_expression_control_elements e.g
promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc
) and a selectable_marker
the selectable_marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell_lines
( emphasis added

'804_patent col._14,_ll._4-19
the underlined sentence_fragment from column 14 when read in context does not suggest that gene_targeting of endogenous coding_sequences is possible within a host_cell
rather the passage states host_cells may be` transformed with the £\-gal_a' i.e
the gene in its entirety or with` dna controlled by appropriate_expression_control_elements and a selectable_marker'
as noted in bold type above the dna in column 14 is foreign_dna introduced into host_cells via vectors
the passage teaches that expression_vectors containing viral_origins of replication are not used to facilitate stable_expression of £\-gal_a
instead column 14 teaches the use of recombinant_plasmids containing other expression control elements such as promoters and enhancers to continuously drive the expression of the £\-gal_a dna located in the plasmids for` long-term high-yield production of recombinant_proteins'
¡¬804_patent at col._14,_ll._4-19

therefore the sentence_fragment in column 14 when read in context teaches the introduction into host_cells of exogenous_dna encoding £\-gal_a together with promoters and enhancers in recombinant_plasmids
this passage does not suggest the introduction into a cell of expression control elements and a portion of a coding_sequence to drive the expression of genes endogenously located within the host_cell
thus the isolated passages in columns 10_and_14 do not even remotely suggest that *1101` chromosomally integrated' means targeting of sequences encoding £\-gal_a that are endogenous to a host_cell

even if arguendo the cited passages did teach an example of gene_targeting such gene_targeting would still require the introduction of exogenous_nucleotide_sequences encoding human_£\-gal_a. gene targeting typically involves the transfection of a vector containing a gene sequence into a cell containing an endogenous form of the gene
upon transfection the exogenous_vector targets the endogenous_gene homologous_recombination occurs and exogenous_sequences become part of the genome.1 this process requires the introduction of at least some foreign_gene dna into the host_cell and is not the same as transposable_elements rearranging genes within a cell
no record evidence suggests that the specification contemplates much less defines the integration and expression of genes outside a chosen chromosome but within a cell via transposable_elements

the prosecution_history like the specification does not permit a broad_interpretation of the claim_term` chromosomally integrated'
the original claims of the ¡¬804_patent recited a method of producing human_£\-gal_a protein and cells for producing this enzyme transformed with a recombinant_vector encoding £\-gal_a
the examiner rejected these claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 1 for lack of enablement because the applicant had not deposited the claimed vector
the examiner considered the deposit` essential' to the claimed invention
the applicant conceded and made the deposit without arguing against the requirement
thus during prosecution the applicant agreed that the pending claims required a recombinant_vector encoding £\-gal_a
later the applicant amended the claims to remove the term` recombinant_vector' but neither the examiner nor the applicant suggested that the amendment rendered the deposit unnecessary
thus the prosecution_history shows the necessity of the deposited exogenous_vector sequences to the ¡¬804_patent_claims

during prosecution the applicant also made arguments to overcome prior_art that are inconsistent with a broad_interpretation of the claim_term` chromosomally integrated'
the examiner rejected the claims under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102_and_103 in view of prior_art that allegedly taught the assembly of expression_vectors containing human_£\-gal_a_sequences
specifically the examiner rejected the pending claims over` the genomic clone containing the promoter for the human_£\-gal_a gene disclosed by quinn or the £\-gala cdnas disclosed by tsuji bishop coppola or calhoun'
based on this prior_art according to the examiner` it would have been obvious to assemble other expression_vectors containing full length £\-gala gene_sequences'

*1102 the applicant responded by distinguishing the prior_art
in particular the applicant noted that the prior_art_references achieved only low_level transient expression of human_£\-gal_a when full-length cdna_sequences were introduced into cos cells
according to the applicant transient expression systems of tsuji and bishop` could not be utilized to produce £\-gal_a since recombinant_protein could not be recovered from the system'
the applicant further stated` in contrast to the prior_art failures and to the applicants surprise the human_£\-gala gene product when stably expressed in mammalian_cell_systems is not only expressed at remarkably high_levels but is actually selectively secreted at very high_levels out of the host_cell so that facile recovery of the active product is finally made possible'
the applicant then stressed that recovery of active_£\-gal_a was an element of the pending method claims.2

these arguments did not persuade the examiner who again issued the same rejections
the examiner noted` the selection of the appropriate plasmids promoters selectable_markers and cell_lines for proper expression of the inserted gene is merely a matter of judicious selection within the scope of the ability of one ordinarily skilled in the art'
without further recourse the applicant submitted an amendment after final_rejection under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.116
this amendment to clarify the points of disagreement with the examiner also included a declaration by dr. ira mellman
in his declaration dr._mellman asserted his surprise at the inventive expression scheme disclosed in the denied claims noting the difficulty of purifying heterologously expressed recombinant_proteins
by definition a heterologously expressed recombinant_protein is not naturally or normally expressed by a particular tissue or cell type
a` heterologoous protein' is recognized by those of skill in the art as being a recombinant_protein` whose amino acid sequence is encoded by a cloned gene'
glick supra at 717 725 ; see also j.m
lackie and j.a
t. dow the dictionary of cell and molecular_biology 212 1999 defining heterologous to mean` [ d ] erived from the tissues or dna of a different species' ; encyclopedia of microbiology 1012 joshua lederberg ed. 2000 defining` heterologous' to mean` derived from a different source or species ; not native to the host'
dr._mellman did not suggest that the claimed expression method embraced expression of endogenous_genes

moreover in its clarifying amendment the applicant stressed again that the prior_art did not teach the` stable_expression of human_£\-galactosidase_a and isolation of enzymatically active_£\-galactosidase_a from an engineered mammalian_cell_system'
eukaryotic host expression systems such as the systems delineated in section 5.2.1 of the ¡¬804_patent have long been understood by those of skill in the art as expression_vector_systems that facilitate expression of eukaryotic genes
see james d. watson et_al. molecular_biology of the gene 614 615 1987` the more we learn about how gene_expression is controlled in eucaryotes the more intelligently we can develop expression_vector_systems.. several factors already encourage the development of eucaryotic systems for the expression of eucaryotic genes
`` ; susan bright et_al. from laboratory to clinic the development of an immunological reagent 112 immunology today 130-31 1991 discussing` eukaryotic *1103 expression systems' including cho_cells transfected with an expression plasmid for the production of recombinant antibodies ; glick supra at 181-87 describing` mammalian_cell expression systems' as being composed of cell_lines such as cos and cho_cells engineered with mammalian expression_vectors to express heterologous proteins
in other_words the applicant expressly confined the invention to production of proteins by introducing vectors into a mammalian_host_cell

the examiner persisted in the rejection until the applicant submitted a supplemental amendment under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.116
the amendment replaced the phrase` transformed with a recombinant_vector which includes a nucleotide_sequence encoding £\-galactosidase_a' with the phrase` chromosomally integrated nucleotide_sequence encoding human_£\-galactosidase_a'
the examiner and applicant agreed on this language during an after-final_rejection examiner interview
the record does not explain the reasons the examiner finally accepted this language

contrary to genzymes position this eleventh-hour amendment did not operate to broaden the claims to eliminate the requirement of insertion of an exogenous gene into a host_cell
in the first_place the deposit_requirement the specification the applicants arguments to distinguish prior_art the examiners responses and dr._mellmans declaration repeatedly stressed that the invention envisioned insertion of an exogenous_gene_sequence into a host_cell
a clarifying amendment at the last moment could not negate that extensive public record

more important the examiner could not accept a second supplemental after-final_amendment broadening the scope of the rejected claims without formal comment from the applicant
under the applicable patent_office rules amendments to patent claims after final_rejection can not alter the substantive scope of the claims without explanation about the necessity of the amendment and without reasons for the delay in proposing the change.big_token__3_see_37__big_token c.f.r.¡± 1.116 b 1992` if amendments touching the merits of the application.. are presented after final_rejection.. they may be admitted upon showing of good and sufficient_reasons why they are necessary and were not earlier presented`
if this amendment markedly broadened the claims it satisfied neither of those requirements
the record supplies no explanation from the applicant or the examiner that these changes were both` necessary' and justifiably` not earlier presented'
thus according to pto_rules the examiner could not have allowed this amendment if it changed at all the scope of the claims set forth in the deposit_requirement the specification the arguments of the applicant and dr._mellmans declaration

the record instead suggests that the examiner felt this last-minute change did not alter the scope of the claims
the examiners comments did not distinguish these newly amended claims from the prior_art but simply noted that the claims had to recite that the £\-gal_a was overexpressed and secreted
likewise the applicant did not address any change in the *1104 scope of the claims
in any event the examiner could not have permitted any rule 116 amendment that expanded the claims to make the introduction of exogenous_dna into a host_cell optional

thus the prosecution_history indicates that the term` chromosomally integrated' requires introduction of exogenous_£\-gal_a_sequences into the host_cell
the claims of the ¡¬804_patent recited these exogenously introduced £\-gal_a_sequences until after prosecution on the merits was closed
the record simply does not show that the examiner contrary to pto_rules vastly broadened these claims upon entering the supplemental after final_amendment to embrace overexpression of human_£\-gal_a_sequences endogenous to a host_cell
the informed public could only understand this prosecution_history as well as the specification and the claim_language itself to limit genzyme as reflected throughout the prosecution

tkt argues that if this court reads the claims as suggested by genzyme they would be invalid
indeed this court notes that the ¡¬804 specification and figures do not discuss any methods of activating endogenous_£\-gal_a gene_sequences
in fact the specification does not discuss` chromosomally integrated' sequences as endogenous_£\-gal_a genes within the host_cells at all
thus the record would appear to raise questions of enablement
see modine_mfg co. v. united_states_int l_trade_comm n 75_f.3d_1545 1557 fed.cir.1996 this court interprets claims` so as to preserve their validity' whenever` reasonably possible'
the district_court however did not decide validity issues and this court need not examine enablement to properly define the claim_term` chromosomally integrated' in view of the specification and prosecution_history

this court also notes that this case is different from amgen inc. v. hoechst marion roussel inc. 314_f.3d_1313_(fed.cir.2003) which accorded a broad reading to similar claims
this court in amgen did not confront a prosecution_history and specification that conclusively limits the scope of the disputed claim_terms
in this case both the specification and the prosecution_history indicate that the patentee employed the term` chromosomally integrated' in a manner inconsistent with a broad textbook meaning that envelopes both endogenous and exogenous sources of sequences encoding genes in a host_cell
see bruce alberts et_al. molecular_biology of the cell 247-50 1983 discussing integration of transposable_elements into the genomes of cells ; lewin supra at 697-702 discussing the introduction and integration of exogenous donor dna into recipient cells in generating stably expressing host_cell_lines and transgenic animals
therefore the district_court did not err in construing this claim_term to require the introduction into a host_cell of exogenous_sequences encoding £\-gal_a

'' regulatory sequence' the district_court construed` regulatory_sequence' in the first occurrence to mean` any and all sequences required for gene_expression of the human_£\-galactosidase_a gene consisting of at least one sequence which promotes gene_expression'
column 14 ll
9-14 of the ¡¬804_patent discloses several examples of regulatory_sequences that are appropriate_expression_control_elements
while the specification teaches a process requiring one or more of these elements to transform cells with £\-gal_a dna it does not teach that all of them are required
the district_court erred in this regard but the error is harmless in view of the trial_courts proper_construction of the claim_term` chromosomally integrated'

*1105` stably' the district_court construed the claim_term` stably' in the phrase` stably overexpressed' to require that` the nucleotide_sequence encoding human_£\-galactosidase_a stays in place once integrated into the chromosome i.e
the chromosomal_change is not transient'
during prosecution the examiner rejected the claims for indefiniteness under ¡± 112 2
in response the applicant gave the examiner a definition of` stably' namely a` stable level and duration of expression of the human_£\-galactosidase_a gene'
this definition as the applicant noted` denotes persistent expression as distinguished from the short-term transient expression systems of the prior_art'

indeed the specification discloses several working examples that show the stable_expression of the human_£\-galactosidase_a gene
the specification particularly points out that the applicant disclosed high_levels of £\-gal_a expression can be achieved with vectors that do not integrate into the hosts chromosome
instead these vectors achieve stable extra-chromosomal expression via transcription of cdna in the presence of a selectable_marker
see ¡¬804_patent at col._13,_ll._63-67
thus the invention as described in the specification achieves stable_expression by chromosomal integration and extra-chromosomal gene_expression
the applicant surrendered the extra-chromosomal embodiment of stable_expression during prosecution

thus the district_court correctly discerned that the claims only embrace stable_expression of gene_sequences integrated into a hosts chromosome
however the specification and prosecution_history do not discuss this stability in terms of duration of chromosomal_change
rather the applicant explicitly described the term` stably' as referring to the level and duration of gene_expression
therefore the district_court erred in construing this term but the error is harmless given the proper_construction of the claim_term` chromosomally integrated'

after construing the claims of the ¡¬804_patent the district_court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement to tkt
summary judgment is appropriate` if the pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories and admissions on file together with the affidavits if any show that there is no genuine_issue as to any material_fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law'
fed.r.civ.p
56 c ; celotex corp. v. catrett 477_u.s._317 322 106_s.ct._2548 91_l.ed.2d_265_(1986)
in deciding whether a genuine_issue of material_fact exists this court draws all justifiable inferences in the nonmovants favor
anderson v. liberty lobby inc. 477_u.s._242 255 106_s.ct._2505 91_l.ed.2d_202_(1986)

as noted above the tkt method of overexpression involves gene_activation
under this method tkt inserts promoters into human_host_cells that` switch on' the endogenous_human_cellular_gene encoding £\-gal_a. tkts protocol does not introduce exogenous_genes into host_cells
genzyme hinged its claim of infringement on a claim interpretation broad enough to encompass gene_targeting
tkt provided declaratory_evidence showing that the ¡¬804_patent did not teach one of skill in the art a workable method of introducing an exogenous_gene_sequence into a cell to recombine with an endogenous_gene residing in the host_chromosome gene_targeting to facilitate gene_activation
the district_court did not decide this validity issue but instead after construing the claims credited tkts declaratory_evidence that its gene_activation method does not infringe genzymes process
genzyme concedes it *1106 can not show infringement by tkt if the ¡¬804_patent_claims require the introduction into a host_cell of exogenous_sequences encoding £\-gal_a
because the claims require this exogenous sequence element genzymes concession precludes a finding that tkt infringes the asserted claims of the ¡¬804_patent
therefore the district_court properly granted summary_judgment of noninfringement to tkt

conclusion
the district_court properly construed the claim_term` chromosomally integrated' but erred in construing the disputed terms` regulatory_sequence' and` stably'
however because the construction of the claim_term` chromosomally integrated' precludes genzyme from showing infringement these latter errors are harmless
therefore this court affirms the district_courts grant of summary_judgment

costs
each party shall bear its own costs

affirmed

linn circuit_judge concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part
while i concur in the majoritys construction of the claim limitations` regulatory_sequence' and` stably overexpressed' i must respectfully dissent from its conclusion regarding the construction of the` chromosomally integrated' limitation
in my view the restriction of the scope of this limitation to require the introduction into a host_cell of` exogenous_sequences encoding £\-gal_a' genzyme slip op.at 1105 unadvisedly reads limitations from the specification into the claims
i can discern no proper basis to do so and would give the` chromosomally integrated' limitation the full scope of its ordinary and customary_meaning

i
claim construction
a
ordinary and customary meaning
it is well settled in our jurisprudence that claim_terms are to be given their ordinary and customary_meaning to one of skill in the relevant_art
johnson_worldwide_assocs. inc. v. zebco_corp. 175_f.3d_985 989 fed.cir.1999
determining the ordinary and customary_meaning of the terms of the claims is the first step in claim construction and consultation of the written description and prosecution_history before attempting to ascertain the ordinary and customary_meaning of the language of the claims is premature
tex
digital sys. inc. v. telegenix inc. 308_f.3d_1193 1204 fed.cir.2002
where the patentees choice of a claim_term` deprive [ s ] the claim of clarity` ccs_fitness inc. v. brunswick_corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1367 fed.cir.2002 however the court must` resort to the other intrinsic_evidence' id. to determine the meaning of the claim_terms

in my view the majority hastens too quickly past the fundamental step of determining the ordinary and customary_meaning of` chromosomally integrated'
it relies on a single definition of` integration' defined in the context of` viral or another dna_sequence' to import the concept of a` host genome'
genzyme slip op.at 1098 ; benjamin_lewin genes_iv 812 1990
in light of this imported concept of a` host_cell' the majority perceives ambiguity as to` whether one of skill in the art at the time of the invention would understand the exogenous_sequences to come from outside the host_cell i.e. a vector or from within the host_cell but outside the critical_chromosome i.e. a transposable_element
`` 4 *1107 genzyme slip op.at 1098
it then turns to the specification to resolve this perceived ambiguity

with all due respect to my colleagues there is no ambiguity here to be resolved
the majority opinion establishes that the term` chromosomally integrated' could be used in reference to the incorporation into a chromosome of either endogenous or exogenous_dna that is to say dna_sequences that have their origin either inside or outside the cell to which the chromosome is native
the ordinary and customary_meaning of the term broadly encompasses both possibilities
it is incorrect to perceive a claim_term as ambiguous merely because of its breadth and to require that the term be redefined to encompass only a portion of its ordinary_meaning in the name of clarity

technical treatises publicly available at the time a patent is issued may be consulted as` reliable sources of information that would have been attributed to the terms of the claims by those of skill in the art'
tex
digital sys. 308 f.3d at 1202-03
see also inverness med
switz
gmbh v. princeton biomeditech corp. 309_f.3d_1365 1370 fed.cir.2002` we may look therefore to the dictionary definition of the claim_term mobility as of the date the patents issued`
a review of the relevant technical treatises contemporaneous with the issuance of the ¡¬804_patent shows that` chromosomally integrated' had a broad meaning encompassing the integration of both exogenous and endogenous_dna
the genes_iv text that the majority cites uses the term` integrated' to describe both the incorporation of viral_dna of extracellular origin genes_iv 674 1990` one or more [ viral ] dna copies become integrated into the host genome
`` and the transposition of yeast transposable_elements from one site to another within the same_genome id.at 681 describing yeast ty transposable_elements as subject to` reverse transcription and integration'
transposable elements such as retroposons were understood at the time to be a part of an organisms own genome
id.at 672` [ w ] e think of retroposons as genomic duplex dna sequences that occasionally transpose within a genome ; they do not migrate between cells`
another contemporaneous leading text similarly describes both viral_dna and transposable_element dna as integrating into the chromosome
bruce alberts et_al. molecular_biology of the cell 255 1989` [ t ] he dna circle [ of the transposable_element ] integrates into a randomly selected site on the chromosome'
the term` chromosomally integrated' was thus commonly understood by those of skill in the art at the time to refer to the incorporation into a chromosome of dna that either came from another site in the same_genome or from outside the cell
this is the ordinary and customary_meaning of the claim_term

b.the intrinsic record
the next step in the claim construction process in this case as in every case is to examine the intrinsic_evidence comprising the claims the written description and the prosecution_history if in evidence to determine whether the patentee has rebutted the presumption that` chromosomally integrated' has its ordinary and customary_meaning
see brookhill-wilk 1 llc v. *1108 intuitive surgical inc. 334_f.3d_1294 1298 fed.cir.2003 ; tex
digital sys. 308 f.3d at 1204
a patentee may rebut this presumption by` defin [ ing ] claim_terminology in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary_meaning' biovail corp. int l v. andrx pharms. inc. 239_f.3d_1297 1301 fed.cir.2001 or by disclaiming a particular interpretation of a claim_term during prosecution biodex corp. v. loredan biomedical inc. 946_f.2d_850 863 fed.cir.1991
i find no redefinition of the claim_term in the intrinsic_evidence nor do i discern any disclaimer of coverage of the integration of endogenous_dna

the word` integrated' or` integration' appears nine times in the sixty-page ¡¬804 written description
none of these instances on its own amounts to a` special definition.. clearly stated in the patent_specification'
vitronics_corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996
the majority correctly notes that` the applicant consistently uses the termintegrated to refer to a foreign_gene inserted into a host_cell_chromosome'
genzyme slip op.at 1099
however this use of` integrated' is not` inconsistent with [ its ] ordinary_meaning' vitronics_corp. 90 f.3d at 1582 and can not therefore be used to show that the patentee has redefined the term` with reasonable clarity deliberateness and precision' in re paulsen 30_f.3d_1475 1480 fed.cir.1994
as the majority demonstrates the ordinary and customary_meaning of` integrated' embraces the incorporation of both exogenous and endogenous_dna
it is immaterial to the proper_construction of` integrated' that the embodiments consistently employ exogenous_dna
absent a redefinition or disclaimer relating to a claim_term consistent use in the written description of a term in a narrower meaning can not trump a broader ordinary and customary_meaning of the term as used in a claim
were it otherwise the scope of claim_terms would regularly be limited to the embodiments disclosed in the specification
but it is the claim_language not the embodiments which control
see renishaw plc v. marposs societa per azioni 158_f.3d_1243 1248 fed.cir.1998 [ t ] he claims define the scope of the right to exclude ; the claim construction inquiry therefore begins and ends in all cases with the actual words of the claim
)

the majority also cites the` summary of the invention' section where` the present_invention' is said to involve` host_cell expression systems' and the abstract which refers to` engineered host_cells'
¡¬804_patent col._6,_ll._22-25 ; abstract
the majority contends that the term` host_cell' necessarily implies the introduction of exogenous_genetic_material and this amounts to a` definition of the invention'
genzyme slip op.at 1099-1100
in other_words the majority sees a redefinition of the claim_term` chromosomally integrated' in the use in the specification of a term` host_cell' that appears nowhere in the claims
in my view the majority roams too far afield in search of a redefinition of the claim_term
it is clear from our precedent that any redefinition must focus on the term actually employed in the claims
see teleflex inc. v. ficosa_n._am corp. 299_f.3d_1313 1324 fed.cir.2002` the claim_language defines the bounds of claim_scope
`` ; interactive gift express inc. v. compuserve inc. 256_f.3d_1323 1331 fed.cir.2001` in construing claims the analytical focus must begin and remain centered on the language of the claims themselves for it is that language that the patentee chose to use toparticularly point [ ] out and distinctly claim [ ] the subject_matter which the patentee regards as his invention
`` ; thermalloy inc. v. aavid eng g inc. 121_f.3d_691 693 fed.cir.1997` [ t ] hroughout the interpretation *1109 process the focus remains on the meaning of claim_language
``

like the written description nothing in the prosecution_history limits or redefines the scope or meaning of` chromosomally integrated'
the majority stresses the fact that` during prosecution the applicant agreed that the pending claims required a recombinant_vector encoding £\-gal_a'
genzyme slip op.at 1101
however this was predicated on the fact that the set of claims then pending explicitly required the use of a recombinant_vector
the examiner made clear that a deposit of the vector was required because the vector was present in the claims since the vector s is/are essential to the claimed invention it must be obtainable by a repeatable method set forth in the specification or otherwise be readily available to the public
if the vector s is/are not so obtainable or available the requirements of 35_usc_112 may be satisfied by deposit s of the vector s
as the majority notes the claims were later amended to remove the term` recombinant_vector' and the issued claims do not contain such a limitation

despite the removal of that limitation however the majority maintains that the deposited vector sequence remained necessary to the claimed invention and this mandates a restriction of the scope of` chromosomally integrated'
i can not agree
the deposit of the recombinant_vector was required by the examiner to establish enablement of then-pending claims that explicitly required its use
when the use of a recombinant_vector was eliminated from the claims the predicate for the examiners deposition requirement evaporated
there is no reason to conclude in this case that an action taken as a result of the presence of a specific term in the claims should continue to bind the patentee when that term is removed during prosecution and does not appear in the issued claims
see smith v. snow 294_u.s._1 16 55_s.ct._279 79_l.ed._721_(1935)` it is of no moment that in the course of the proceedings in the patent_office the rejection of narrow claims was followed by the allowance of the broader claim 1
`` ; united_states v. telectronics inc. 857_f.2d_778 783 fed.cir.1988 the arguments emphasizing the use of a skin electrode which were made at the time the application claims explicitly contained such a limitation can not furnish a basis for restricting issued claim 1 which lacks any such limitation
) ; kistler instrumente ag
v. united_states 224_ct.cl._370 628_f.2d_1303 1308 1980 [ d ] efendants insistance [ sic ] upon this courts reading back into the claims limitations which were originally there and were removed during prosecution of the application through the patent_office can not be permitted
)

the majority doubts however whether the removal of the recombinant_vector limitation from the issued claims actually represented a broadening of the claims
given that the amendment occurred at a late stage of prosecution the majority states that if it were in fact broadening the amendment would have been a violation of 37_c.f.r._1116 b because the patentee made no showing of good and sufficient_reasons why [ it was ] necessary and [ was ] not earlier presented
37_c.f.r._1116 b 1992
a decision restricting the scope of an otherwise unambiguous claim_term based on an applicants presumed noncompliance with a procedural_rule of the pto strikes me as ill-founded
see dethmers mfg co. inc. v. automatic equip
mfg co. 293_f.3d_1364 1366 fed.cir.2002 linn j. dissenting from the order denying rehearing en banc [ o ] nce a patent_issues non-compliance with a procedural_rule administered by the pto within the scope of the agencys statutory authority *1110 and found by virtue of the grant of the patent to have been satisfied during prosecution is in and of itself of no consequence
)

the majority also relies on arguments distinguishing certain prior_art_references to establish that the patentee` expressly confined the invention to production of proteins by introducing vectors into a mammalian_host_cell'
genzyme slip op.at 1102-1103
to establish a disclaimer or disavowal of claim_scope of course a patentee must use` words or expressions of manifest_exclusion or restriction representing a clear_disavowal of claim_scope'
tex
digital sys. 308 f.3d at 1204
the majority finds such a manifest_exclusion of the use of a cells own endogenous_dna in the patentees assertions that the claimed invention was capable of recovering` recombinant_protein' and that such` heterologously expressed recombinant_proteins' are difficult to purify
genzyme slip op.at 1101-1102
the patentee also referred to the claimed inventions use of` an engineered mammalian_cell_system'
id. slip op.at 1102-1103
i see no clear_disavowal of the use of endogenous_dna in these remarks
neither tsuji nor bishop employed endogenous_dna
the essence of the patentees argument was that while the prior_art employed exogenous_dna to achieve a low_level of transient expression the claimed invention was` the first demonstration of the stable overexpression selective secretion and subsequent isolation of a lysosomal enzyme in a recombinant mammalian_cell_system'
whether the prior_art_references integrated the cells own dna into a different chromosomal site was simply not at issue

ii
enablement
the majority notes that` the record would appear to raise questions of enablement' although it also states that` this court need not examine enablement to properly define the claim_termchromosomally integrated in view of the specification and prosecution_history'
genzyme slip op.at 1104
to the extent that enablement concerns underlie the majoritys narrowing of the scope of` chromosomally integrated' however i suggest that such issues are not yet ripe for consideration
the district_court has not yet addressed validity and the parties did not brief the issue on appeal
although this court has stated that claims should be interpreted so as to preserve their validity whenever reasonably possible modine_mfg co. v. united_states_int l_trade_comm n 75_f.3d_1545 1557 fed.cir.1996 it is wrong to allow enablement issues that have not yet been fully ventilated by the parties and the district_court to influence a claim construction determination
i agree that all validity concerns should be left for another day

the thomas article notes` gene targeting-the homologous_recombination of dna_sequences residing in the chromosome with newly introduced dna_sequences-provides a means for systematically altering the mammalian genome.. a desired alteration would first be introduced into a cloned dna_sequence and gene_targeting would then transfer the alteration into the genome'
the smithies article states` [ t ] he experiments reported here establish that the planned modification of a specific human gene can be accomplished in mammalian_cells by homologous_recombination without detectably affecting other parts of the genome'
