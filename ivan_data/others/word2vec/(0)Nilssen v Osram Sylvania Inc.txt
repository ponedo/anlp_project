** opinion
lourie circuit_judge
ole k. nilssen and the geo_foundation ltd. collectively` appellants' appeal from the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the northern_district of illinois in favor of osram_sylvania inc. and osram_sylvania_products inc. collectively` osram' holding fifteen patents issued to nilssen and exclusively licensed to the geo_foundation unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
because the district_court did not abuse its discretion we affirm the courts entry of judgment of unenforceability

background
nilssen is the inventor on a large number of patents related to electrical lighting products
at issue in this appeal are fifteen of his patents the first eleven allegedly infringed by osram and the last four withdrawn shortly before trial u.s
patents 4,857,806` the ¡¬806_patent` ; 5,164,637` the ¡¬637_patent` ; 5,233,270` the ¡¬270_patent` ; 5,343,123` the ¡¬ 123 patent' ; 5,402,043` the ¡¬043_patent` ; 5,416,386` the ¡¬386_patent` ; 5,432,409` the ¡¬409_patent` ; 5,479,074` the ¡¬074_patent` ; 5,481,160` the ¡¬160_patent` ; 5,510,680` the ¡¬680_patent` ; and 5,510,681` the ¡¬681_patent` collectively the` patents in suit' ; and 4,677,345` the ¡¬345_patent` ; 5,047,690` the ¡¬690_patent` ; 5,189,342` the ¡¬342_patent` ; and 5,341,067` the ¡¬067_patent`
the patents relate to compact fluorescent_light_bulbs and to ballasts for gas_discharge_lamps such as fluorescent_light_bulbs
a ballast converts the low frequency alternating current_power provided by a utility to high frequency alternating current_power necessary for the operation of gas_discharge_lamps

after initially relying on attorneys to prosecute his patents in 1983 nilssen began prosecuting his own patent_applications including those resulting in the patents in suit because he felt that his *1227 understanding of the subject_matter was better than that of any attorney
nilssen was sufficiently knowledgeable of patent law and practice to cite the manual of patent examining procedure` mpep' patent statutes and regulations and case_law during prosecution of his patent_applications

nilssen established the geo_foundation as a not-for-profit charitable organization in the cayman islands in 1998
since june 2000 the geo_foundation has been the exclusive_licensee of nilssens patents
prior to that date nilssen licensed at least some of the patents in suit directly to philips electronics north america corp.` philips'
apparently that license was canceled or revoked and geo began sublicensing those patents to philips following the execution of its exclusive license agreement with nilssen
the geo_foundation receives all licensing revenue from the patents and any damages awards or settlements resulting from lawsuits to enforce the patents
it pays all litigation costs associated with those lawsuits and it pays nilssen twenty-five percent of its gross income

appellants sued osram in 2000 alleging that electronic_ballasts manufactured and sold by osram infringed eleven of nilssens patents
among the defenses asserted by osram was that nilssen had engaged in inequitable_conduct in the procurement of the patents
the district_court held a six-day bench trial on osrams inequitable_conduct defenses

first the court determined that nilssens submission of two affidavits from dale fiene one during reexamination of the ¡¬345_patent and one during examination of the application that led to the ¡¬690_patent in support of the patentability of claims rejected by the examiner constituted inequitable_conduct because the affidavits failed to disclose fienes personal and professional association with nilssen and fienes financial interest in nilssens patents
however the court found that the reference to the ¡¬345_patent in the description of the prior_art in the ¡¬270 and ¡¬681_patent s and the fact that the three patents share a common parent application did not demonstrate sufficient relatedness among the three patents for the inequitable_conduct during prosecution of the ¡¬345_patent to also render the ¡¬270 and ¡¬ 681 patents unenforceable under what the court referred to as the` doctrine of infectious_unenforceability'

second the district_court considered whether nilssens incorrect payment of small_entity_maintenance_fees for the patents in suit constituted inequitable_conduct
nilssen entered into a compact fluorescent lamp agreement the` cfla' with philips effective december 7 1995
the cfla provided as follows emphasis added nilssen expects to offer cfl manufacturers a preferential running royalty rate under his cfl_patents for a limited time_period starting the first quarter of 1996
nilssen and philips agree that nilssen will offer and philips will take a standard license from nilssen under his cfl_patents at the preferential rate provided that no royalties or payments will accrue under such_license until nilssen has licensed one cfl_competitor having at least 10 % dollar share of the u.s. market for cfls
the court found that the cfla covered the ¡¬806 ¡¬637 ¡¬270 ¡¬123 ¡¬680 and ¡¬ 681 patents
nilssen also entered into a patent license agreement` pla' with philips effective january 1 1996
the court found that the pla covered the ¡¬806 ¡¬637 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬074 ¡¬160 ¡¬680 and ¡¬681_patent_s. because the court found that these agreements created a license or an obligation to license all of the patents in *1228 suit and philips had more than 500 employees at all relevant times the court concluded that nilssen was obligated to pay large_entity_maintenance_fees on all the patents in suit after december 7 1995 the date of the cfla
the court also found that nilssen had made twenty-one improper small entity payments including at least one for each patent in suit compared with eight proper large entity payments
the court did not credit nilssens explanation that he did not believe that large entity payments were required for the patents once they were licensed to the nonprofit geo_foundation in 2000
the court thus concluded that all of the patents in suit were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in failing to pay large_entity_maintenance_fees

third the court found that nilssen had intentionally misclaimed an effective priority date of march_20,_1978 in the ¡¬637 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬ 160 ¡¬680 and ¡¬681_patent_s. the court found that the statutory copendency and/or cross-reference requirements were not satisfied for each of these patents
the court found the false claims material because they allowed nilssen to potentially avoid prior_art
the court based its finding of intent in part on two letters nilssen sent to a customer advance_transformer_co. stating that it might be difficult to obtain effective_patent_protection for some parts of a new ballast design that might` be considered as representing known art'
the court thus concluded that the ¡¬637 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬160 ¡¬ 680 and ¡¬681_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct based upon the claims of false effective priority dates

fourth the court considered whether nilssens failure to disclose to the examiner ongoing_litigation with motorola rendered some of the patents unenforceable
nilssen filed a lawsuit against motorola_alleging_infringement of six patents on october 19 1993
motorola denied infringement claiming invalidity for anticipation obviousness and failure to observe the requirements of 35 u.s.c.¡± 112
those claims were dismissed without prejudice on july_23,_1996
a new lawsuit was filed against motorola_alleging_infringement of the same six patents plus nine additional nilssen patents on september 3 1996
all of the patents involved in those suits pertained to the same_general_subject_matter-electronic_ballasts-claimed in the patents in suit
the applications leading to the ¡¬123 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬074 ¡¬160 ¡¬ 680 and ¡¬681_patent s were pending during the time of the motorola suits but nilssen failed to inform the examiner of the litigation
the court found that nilssen intended to mislead the united_states_patent and trademark_office` pto' and did not credit nilssens testimony that he was unaware of the duty to disclose information concerning the ongoing_litigation to the pto
the court thus concluded that the ¡¬123 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬074 ¡¬160 ¡¬680 and ¡¬681_patent s were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct for failing to report the existence of the motorola_litigation to the pto

fifth the court concluded that nilssen had engaged in inequitable_conduct in the prosecution of the ¡¬342_patent and the ¡¬067_patent as well as the ¡¬ 806 ¡¬043 and ¡¬681_patent s by failing to identify to the pto relevant prior_art of which he had knowledge
however the court found that the` descendant relationship' of the ¡¬123 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 and ¡¬160_patent s to the ¡¬342_patent did not render them unenforceable through what it referred to as the` doctrine of infectious_unenforceability'

finally the court rejected osrams argument that each of the patents in suit should be held unenforceable under the doctrine of unclean hands

*1229 appellants timely appealed
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

discussion
each of the issues on appeal to this court concerns a determination that a subset of the patents in suit is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
prior to our review of the individual allegations we therefore lay out the general standards for reviewing a holding of inequitable_conduct
we review a district_courts ultimate decision on a claim of inequitable_conduct for an abuse of discretion and its threshold findings on materiality and intent for clear_error
an abuse of discretion occurs when 1 the courts decision is clearly unreasonable arbitrary or fanciful 2 the courts decision is based on an erroneous construction of the law 3 the courts factual findings are clearly erroneous or 4 the record contains no evidence upon which the court rationally could have based its decision
under the clear_error standard the courts findings will not be overturned in the absence of a` definite and firm conviction' that a mistake has been made
impax labs. inc. v. aventis pharm inc. 468_f.3d_1366 1375 2006 citations omitted
applicants for patents have a duty to prosecute patent_applications in the patent office with candor good faith and honesty
a breach of this duty-including affirmative misrepresentations of material facts failure to disclose material_information or submission of false material_information-coupled with an intent to deceive constitutes inequitable_conduct
in determining whether inequitable_conduct occurred a trial_court must determine whether the party asserting the inequitable_conduct defense has shown by clear and convincing_evidence that the alleged nondisclosure or misrepresentation occurred that the nondisclosure or misrepresentation was material and that the patent applicant acted with the intent to deceive the united_states_patent and trademark_office
honeywell int l inc. v. universal avionics sys corp. 488_f.3d_982 999 fed.cir.2007 citations omitted

i
patents no longer in suit
on appeal appellants argue that the district_court erred by ruling four patents no longer asserted against osram-the ¡¬345_patent the ¡¬690_patent the ¡¬067_patent and the ¡¬342_patent -unenforceable
appellants argue that the district_court should have first considered whether there was a sufficiently close relationship between the patents in suit and the patents that osram alleged were unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct before considering whether the patents not in suit were unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
in addition appellants argue that in the case of the ¡¬345 and ¡¬ 690 patents the fiene_affidavit was not material because the examiner in those applications did not request an affidavit from a disinterested party and osram failed to demonstrate any error in the affidavit
osram responds that a patent must be found unenforceable before turning to the question whether it taints other related patents
osram then argues that it would be` impractical' for the district_court to evaluate the issues in the order suggested by appellants but fails to elaborate on that theory
osram does not directly address the materiality of the fiene_affidavit

we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding that nilssen engaged in inequitable_conduct with respect to the ¡¬345 and ¡¬690_patent s by submitting affidavits by fiene *1230 in support of patentability including points of distinction over prior_art_patents without informing the examiner of the affiants relationship to nilssen
even though the examiner did not raise a question concerning any such relationship it is material to an examiners evaluation of the credibility and content of affidavits to know of any significant relationship between an affiant and an applicant see ferring b.v. v. barr labs. inc. 437_f.3d_1181 1187-88 fed.cir.2006 ; failure to disclose that relationship violated nilssens duty of disclosure
as for the ¡¬067 and ¡¬342_patent s appellants do not contest the materiality of the prior_art_references the district_court found were intentionally withheld during their prosecutions
because inequitable_conduct with respect to one or more patents in a family can infect related applications see e.g. consolidated aluminum corp. v. foseco int l ltd. 910_f.2d_804_(fed.cir.1990) we find no abuse of discretion in the district_courts holding the ¡¬345 ¡¬690 ¡¬067 and ¡¬342_patent s unenforceable prior to determining whether the inequitable_conduct related to each of those four patents should render additional_related_patents unenforceable as well
trial judges are entitled to arrange the priority of issues in a manner that they consider efficient
cf
r.r
dynamics inc. v. a. stucki co. 727_f.2d_1506 1515 fed.cir.1984` district courts have broad authority and discretion in controlling the conduct of a trial`
our conclusion to affirm the trial_courts holding with respect to the four patents is further supported by the fact that these four patents were withdrawn from the suit only shortly before trial at the last minute
it was not an abuse of discretion for the district_court when these patents were sued upon and maintained in the suit up until just before trial to hold these four patents unenforceable even though it did not include them in its entry of judgment

ii
improper payment of small entity maintenance fees
different facts are relevant to the consideration of the appropriate maintenance fee payments and nilssens intent for the time_period prior to late 2000 when nilssen made the agreements concerning his patents and the following time_period when geo began to license nilssens patents to others
we therefore treat these two time_periods separately

a
payments through late 2000 nilssen licensing period certain entities including` independent_inventors' are entitled to pay reduced patent maintenance_fees see 35 u.s.c.¡± 41 h 1
the relevant pto regulation defines` independent_inventors' as` any inventor who 1 has not.. licensed and 2 is under no obligation under contract or law to.. license any rights in the invention to any person who could not likewise be classified as an independent_inventor.. or to any concern which would not qualify as a small business concern or a nonprofit_organization' see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.9 c july_1,_2000

appellants argue that the cfla did not constitute such an obligation to license so that it did not remove nilssen from the definition of an independent_inventor entitled to pay small_entity_maintenance_fees for the patents included in the agreement
the payments to which this argument applies are the issuance_fee for the ¡¬681_patent in december 1997 and the four-year maintenance payment for the ¡¬270_patent in january 1997
the only patents in suit covered by the cfla but not included in the pla are the ¡¬270 and ¡¬ 123 patents and no payment was due for the ¡¬123_patent during the time_period in question
although it was covered by both the cfla and the pla the issuance_fee was *1231 paid for the ¡¬681_patent in late december of 1995 after execution of the cfla but before execution of the pla
osram responds that the cfla created an obligation to license philips within the plain meaning of the regulation and that whether the obligation had` vested' or not is irrelevant

we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the cfla precluded nilssen from being eligible to pay small_entity_fees on the patents covered by that agreement
interpretation of a contract is a question of law that we review de novo
carnes co. v. stone creek mech. inc. 412_f.3d_845 853 7th cir.2005 ; cyrix corp. v. intel corp. 77_f.3d_1381 1384 fed.cir.1996
this court reviews a district_courts interpretation of agency regulations without deference
shockley v. arcan inc. 248_f.3d_1349 1357 fed.cir.2001
the clear import of the pto regulation benefiting small entities is to ensure that inventors currently receiving a revenue_stream from or reasonably expected to receive a revenue_stream from an entity that is not itself entitled to pay small_entity_fees should not be able to claim that right
while the cfla first uses the future tense to describe a possible license agreement stating that nilssen` will offer' and philips` will take' a license it follows up that sentence by providing that` no royalties or payments will accrue under such_license until nilssen has licensed one cfl_competitor' indicating that such a license was intended to be a present one but that royalties would not accrue until other conditions were satisfied
we do not believe the district_court erred when it interpreted that contract to mean that nilssen had in effect licensed philips on december 7 1995
in fact the pla which unequivocally was a license was executed less than one month after the cfla covering most of the same patents as the cfla
obviously the parties considered the cfla to be at least an agreement or obligation to license

appellants argue that the payment of small_entity_maintenance_fees for the ¡¬806_patent in february of 1997 and for the ¡¬160_patent in june of 1999 were simple oversights by nilssen
appellants point to the fact that nilssen made eight large entity maintenance fee payments for seven of the patents in suit between 1996_and_2000 to demonstrate that nilssen paid large_entity_fees when he believed they were required
appellants add that the title of the ¡¬806_patent` self-ballasted screw-in fluorescent lamp' makes it appear upon a superficial examination that the patent relates to a cfl rather than a ballast design that falls within the scope of the pla
osram responds that the district_court made credibility_findings regarding nilssens knowledge of the patents covered by the agreements with philips and that appellants argument asks this court to overrule the district_courts credibility_findings despite the substantial deference we give to such findings

while a misrepresentation of small_entity_status is not strictly speaking inequitable_conduct in the prosecution of a patent as the patent has already issued if maintenance_fees are payable excepting an issue fee it is not beyond the authority of a district_court to hold a patent unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in misrepresenting ones status as justifying small entity maintenance payments
ulead sys. inc. v. lex computer & mgmt corp. 351_f.3d_1139 1146 fed.cir.2003
the district_court found clear and convincing_evidence of` nilssens obvious_intent to mislead'
the court also found nilssens exculpability_statements` not credible'
while an opposite conclusion could have been reached it is not the function of a *1232 court of appeals to override district_court judgments on close issues where credibility_findings have been made
thus we affirm the district_courts holding that the ¡¬681 ¡¬270 ¡¬806 and ¡¬160_patent s are unenforceable

b
payments after late 2000 geo licensing period appellants argue that the district_courts conclusion that geo could not be considered a not-for-profit organization is entirely unsupported because the court cited no law in support of its conclusion and nilssen gave unrebutted testimony that he relied upon the advice of competent counsel that geo was a proper nonprofit entity
appellants thus argue that nilssens explanation for paying small_entity_maintenance_fees for the patents licensed by geo was reasonable
because the pto regulations explicitly excluded an inventor who had licensed his patents to a large_company from the definition of an` independent_inventor' eligible to pay small_entity_fees see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.9 c july_1,_2000 but did not explicitly state the same exclusion for a nonprofit_organization see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.9 e july_1,_2000 nilssen testified that he believed that a nonprofit_organization that licensed patents to a large_company was still eligible to pay small_entity_fees
appellants further argue that the fact that the pto changed the regulation for nonprofits in late 2000 specifically noting the confusion created by the prior inconsistent definitions to explicitly exclude nonprofits licensing to large_companies see 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.27 a 3 i demonstrates the prior ambiguity of the regulation
nilssen also stated that he was simply not aware of the rule change in 2000 because he had continued to rely on a pre-2000 version of the mpep as his primary reference
in response osram argues that the district_court did not find nilssens testimony credible particularly as to whether he was unaware of the clarification of the regulation defining a nonprofit_organization
osram also states that the district_court properly found geo to be a` sham' but provides no support for that conclusion

we agree with osram that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in finding all of the patents in suit unenforceable because nilssen claimed small_entity_status after the date geo licensed1 the patents in suit
the pto relies on applicants to accurately represent their fee status and it is for a fact-finder to evaluate whether any intentional_misrepresentations occur in doing so
the district_court did not credit nilssens testimony that he was aware of the pre-2000 fee regulations but yet not aware of the clarification of the relevant regulation in 2000
while the ptos own admission of ambiguity in the regulation prior to 2000 see changes to implement the patent business goals 65_fed.reg._54613_(september_8,_2000) may have made a belief that nonprofits were subject to different treatment than independent_inventors reasonable during that time frame we see no clear_error in the district_courts finding that it was not believable that nilssen was aware of a specific alleged ambiguity in his favor but ignorant of a change that *1233 eliminated the alleged ambiguity shortly thereafter

we therefore affirm the district_courts decision finding that all of the patents in suit are unenforceable due to inequitable_conduct in improperly claiming small_entity_status

iii
misclaimed priorities
appellants argue that our case_law establishes a rule that an improper claim to an earlier priority date is only material to patentability if the applicant asserts that earlier date to overcome or exclude prior_art
appellants also argue that it was clear_error for the district_court to conclude that nilssen intended to mislead the examiner based upon two letters sent to advance_transformer_co. a division of philips near the time when nilssen began to cross-reference earlier patent_applications
osram responds that a misrepresentation may still be material even in the absence of reliance by an examiner
osram also argues that the district_courts finding of intent was reasonable in light of nilssens change in patent application drafting practice to recite the alleged application histories together with the two letters indicating a concern about obtaining effective_patent_protection for newly developed designs

we agree with osram that the district_courts conclusion that the claims to priority in the ¡¬637 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬160 ¡¬680 and ¡¬681_patent s constituted inequitable_conduct was not an abuse of discretion
it is not necessary for a holding of inequitable_conduct that an examiner rely on a claim for priority or that entitlement to an earlier priority be expressly argued in order to overcome prior_art
nilssen recited in his various patent_applications paternity from earlier applications the obvious purpose of which is to be able to assert a claim for priority over intervening publications or other patent-defeating occurrences if needed
the district_court found and appellants are not contesting that the recitation of application histories did not comply with the applicable 35 u.s.c.¡± 120 requirements and certain applications were thus not entitled to earlier priority dates

a claim for priority is inherently material to patentability because a priority date may determine validity whether an issue arises in prosecution or later in court challenges to validity
while an active misrepresentation made during prosecution in order to avoid prior_art is no doubt` highly material' see li second family ltd. p'shp v. toshiba corp. 231_f.3d_1373 1380 fed.cir.2000 a misrepresentation that would not have immediately affected patentability is still material see digital control inc. v. charles mach
works 437_f.3d_1309 1318 fed.cir.2006
in addition we can not say that the district_courts finding that nilssens disclosures that his patents were derived from earlier_ones were intentional_misrepresentations was clearly erroneous given that the district_court made credibility determinations
nilssens contemporaneous letters stating his concern about securing patent protection for new designs in light of unspecified prior_art supported the courts finding
we therefore affirm the district_courts conclusion that the ¡¬637 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬160 ¡¬680 and ¡¬681_patent s are unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in misclaiming priority

iv
failure to disclose the motorola litigation
appellants argue that the district_court failed to conduct an adequate comparison of the` subject_matter' of the patents in the motorola_litigation with the claims of the patents in suit to determine whether nilssen violated *1234 mpep ¡± 2001.06 c 2 in failing to bring the litigation to the attention of the examiner
appellants also argue that even if the existence of the litigation could be considered material to the examination of the patents motorola asserted only generalized allegations of invalidity in its case so the degree of materiality of its litigation to the examination of nilssens patent_applications was very low
appellants add that the only evidence of intent to support the district_courts decision was its discrediting of nilssens testimony that he was unaware of the relevant rule
osram responds that nilssen accused the same type of product of infringing his patents in the motorola_litigation as he accuses in this case that three of the patents in suit are direct descendents of patents asserted in the motorola_litigation and that all of the patents in suit and the patents asserted in the motorola_litigation relate to the same_general_subject_matter
osram also argues that the district_court was correct to find the litigation highly material and that ¡± 2001.06 c was adjacent in the mpep to provisions with which nilssen was admittedly familiar

we conclude that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding eight patents unenforceable for inequitable_conduct based upon nilssens failure to disclose the motorola_litigation
it is clear from the language of ¡± 2001.06 c that the existence of the litigation itself is material_information that an examiner needs to have
it is important because it signals the examiner that other_material_information relevant to patentability may become available through the litigation proceedings
the pto obviously considers such information material and there is no basis for us to conclude otherwise
we therefore affirm the district_courts holding that the ¡¬123 ¡¬ 043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬074 ¡¬160 ¡¬680 and ¡¬681_patent s are unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in failing to disclose the motorola_litigation

v. failure to disclose prior art
appellants argue that the district_courts finding that u.s. patent 4,266,134 the` franke_patent' was highly material to the prosecution of the ¡¬ 806 patent was clearly erroneous because the claims of the ¡¬806_patent referenced by the district_court require a` gas_discharge_lamp' and a` screw base' small enough to fit a standard lamp socket whereas the franke_patent concerns an x-ray device
appellants further argue that the pto board of patent appeals and interferences found during the prosecution of a different nilssen patent application that the franke_patent does not reasonably suggest connecting its inverter circuitry to a gas_discharge_lamp and called this oversight by the examiner` glaring'
next appellants argue that the district_court failed to explain how nilssen should have known of the materiality of the reference allegedly withheld during prosecution of the ¡¬681_patent -u.s. patent 4,251,752 the` stolz patent' -or the references allegedly withheld during prosecution of the ¡¬043_patent -u.s
patents 4,045,711 the` pitel patent' ; 4,461,980 ; *big_token__1235_and_4__big_token053,813 the` kornrumpf patent' -and thus acted with intent to withhold them
osram responds that the district_court was entitled to rely on testimony from its expert that inverters are not limited to a particular type of application and that one of ordinary skill in the art would apply the teachings of the franke_patent to a gas_discharge_lamp
osram also points to the high degree of materiality of the references and the fact that each was repeatedly cited to nilssen by pto examiners during the prosecution of various of his patents

we agree with osram that the district_courts findings regarding the references withheld by nilssen were not clearly erroneous
`` information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable_examiner would have considered the information important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent'
honeywell 488 f.3d at 1000 internal quotations omitted
the fact that nilssen had repeatedly cited or had cited to him the prior_art_references in question makes it highly likely that a reasonable_examiner would have wanted to consider the information in the withheld patents in determining patentability
given that these material references were repeatedly before nilssen and his failure to offer any good faith explanation for withholding them other than mere oversight we find an inference that nilssen intended to deceive the pto not unreasonable
we therefore affirm the district_courts conclusion that the ¡¬806 ¡¬043 and ¡¬ 681 patents are unenforceable for inequitable_conduct in the withholding of material prior_art_references during their prosecution

a few closing comments are in order
each of the issues on which the district_court found inequitable_conduct generated defenses by nilssen that were not per se unreasonable when considered in isolation
the cfla was not beyond an interpretation contrary to what the district_court adopted
nilssen did pay some fees that were large_entity_fees
failure to cite the motorola_litigation to the pto may have been an oversight as perhaps failure to cite prior_art might have been
perhaps nilssen did not expressly assert an unjustified earlier priority date to obviate prior_art

however this case presents a collection of such problems which the district_court evaluated thoroughly and considered including making credibility_findings and it concluded that the record and testimony indicated repeated attempts to avoid playing fair and square with the patent system
mistakes do happen but inadvertence can carry an applicant only so far
thus we can not find that the courts holding of unenforceability was an abuse of discretion
perhaps some of the errors were attributable to mr._nilssens representing himself during the prosecution of his patents
it surely was true that he knew more about the subject_matter of his inventions than most or even any attorney
that is almost always the case with an invention particularly one dealing with complex subject_matter
however the patent process is a complicated one one that requires both technical and legal credentials in order to effectively prosecute patents for inventors
the same credentials are generally required to prosecute patents on ones own inventions
mr._nilssen while apparently gaining considerable knowledge of the patenting process thought he did n't need professional patent help
the result of this case regrettably proves that he was wrong

conclusion
for the reasons stated we affirm the district_courts holding that the ¡¬ 806 ¡¬637 ¡¬270 ¡¬123 ¡¬043 ¡¬386 ¡¬409 ¡¬074 ¡¬160 ¡¬680 *1236 ¡¬681 ¡¬ 345 ¡¬690 ¡¬067 and ¡¬342_patent s are unenforceable

affirmed

after reviewing the record before us it is not clear which of the patents in suit were licensed by geo or to which companies geo granted licenses following the execution of the exclusive master license agreement with nilssen
for purposes of this analysis however we will assume that the district_court found all small entity payments for the patents in suit after june of 2000 to be improper because geo had licensed the patents to at least one company that did not qualify for small_entity_status
appellants do not argue that some of the patents were not licensed to large_companies
