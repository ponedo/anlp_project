these consolidated appeals stem from two related patent infringement actions brought in the united_states_district_court for the middle_district of florida by voter_verified inc.` voter_verified' against premier_election_solutions inc.` premier' diebold inc.` diebold' and election_systems & software inc.` election_systems' collectively` defendants' in which voter_verified alleged infringement of claims 1-94 of u.s. reissue patent re40 449 the` ¡¬449_patent`1 as the respective appellate briefs are virtually identical we consider the cases together

on summary_judgment the district_court held claims 1-93 not infringed and invalidated claims 49_and_94 but the court also dismissed the defendants counterclaim that claims 85_and_93 are invalid and held that claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92 are not invalid.2 voter_verified inc. v. premier_election_solutions inc. no._609-cv-1968 m.d.fla

on appeal voter_verified challenges a large number of the district_courts rulings including its judgments in favor of the defendants on infringement and invalidity while premier and election_systems cross-appeal as to the validity of the surviving claims of the ¡¬449_patent
for the reasons that follow we affirm

background
the ¡¬449_patent assigned to voter_verified issued on august 5 2008 and claims priority from an application filed on december 7 2000
the patent discloses and claims automated systems and methods for voting in an election featuring a self-verification procedure by which` machine and human error may be detected and corrected before the ballot is submitted by the voter for tabulation'
¡¬449_patent_col. 3_ll._9 -11
briefly the voter enters a vote into an electronic_voting_station which temporarily records the voters input in digital storage and generates a corresponding printed ballot
that printed ballot is then checked for accuracy either by presentation to the voter for visual inspection or by a computerized scanning mechanism capable of comparing the face of the printed ballot with the vote data represented in the stations temporary storage
in either case only ballots deemed consistent with the voters intended or recorded input are accepted for final tabulation

the defendants produce and market automated voting_systems
in november *1379 2009 voter_verified filed two nearly identical infringement complaints based on the ¡¬449_patent one directed at premier and diebold and the other targeting election_systems
the defendants denied infringement and sought declaratory judgments of invalidity on various grounds including anticipation obviousness and indefiniteness

in a series of summary_judgment orders the district_court held that the defendants had not infringed claims 1-93
in addition the court concluded that claim 94 was invalid as indefinite under 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
2 and that claim 49 was invalid as obvious under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 in view of an article the` benson_article' obtained from an online periodical concerned with computer safety and security known as the risks_digest
the district_court entered summary_judgment against premier and election_systems however on their invalidity_counterclaims regarding claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92 holding that they had` fail [ ed ] to present any argument or evidence regarding the invalidity of these claims' and therefore could not satisfy their burden of establishing invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
finally the district_court dismissed without prejudice diebolds invalidity_counterclaims as to claims 1-big_token__48_and_50__big_token -93 as well as premier and election_systems invalidity_counterclaims regarding claims 85_and_93

voter_verified appeals on numerous grounds including the judgments of noninfringement and invalidity and both premier and election_systems cross-appeal regarding the validity of claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

a. invalidity
the district_court held claims 49_and_94 of the ¡¬449_patent invalid as obvious and indefinite respectively
while no longer defending claim 94 voter_verified argues that the district_courts invalidation of claim 49 was incorrect
premier and election_systems cross-appeal as to the validity of claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92

1
claim 49
voter_verified challenges the district_courts invalidity determination regarding claim 49 and in particular its reliance on the benson_article as prior_art
voter_verified contends that a web-based reference like the benson_article must be` searchable by pertinent terms over the internet' to qualify as a prior_art` printed publication' as defined by 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b and voter_verified argues further that the defendants` provided no evidence of any indexing on any database' that would have allowed the interested public to locate the risks_digest_website much less the benson_article contained therein
according to voter_verified the benson_article therefore should have been excluded from the district_courts obviousness analysis
the defendants respond that the benson_article qualifies as prior_art because it was posted on a public website well known to those interested in the art of voting technologies-the risks_digest-and could be retrieved from that website by searching based on subject_matter

we conclude not only that the benson_article is a` printed publication' *1380 within the meaning of ¡± 102 b but also that it renders claim 49 obvious under ¡± 103
when considering whether a given reference qualifies as a prior_art` printed publication' the key inquiry is whether the reference was made` sufficiently accessible to the public interested in the art' before the critical_date
in re cronyn 890_f.2d_1158 1160 fed.cir.1989 quoting constant v. advanced micro-devices inc. 848_f.2d_1560 1568 fed.cir.1988
`` whether a reference is publicly accessible is determined on a case-by-case basis based on thefacts and circumstances surrounding the references disclosure to members of the public
`` in re lister 583_f.3d_1307 1311 fed.cir.2009 quoting in re klopfenstein 380_f.3d_1345 1350 fed.cir.2004
public accessibility is a legal conclusion based on underlying factual determinations
cooper cameron corp. v. kvaerner oilfield prods. inc. 291_f.3d_1317 1321 fed.cir.2002

voter_verified emphasizes indexing as a determinant of public_accessibility in this case
to be sure indexing is a relevant factor in determining accessibility of potential prior_art particularly library-based references
see e.g. in re hall 781_f.2d_897_(fed.cir.1986) holding that a dissertation indexed in a university library catalog was a publicly accessible printed publication ; in re bayer 568_f.2d_1357_(ccpa_1978) holding that a thesis housed but neither shelved nor catalogued within a university library was not publicly accessible
but indexing is not` a necessary condition for a reference to be publicly accessible' ; it is but one among many factors that may bear on public_accessibility
lister 583 f.3d at 1312
moreover indexing is no more or less important in evaluating the public_accessibility of online_references than for those fixed in more traditional tangible media
in both situations the ultimate question is whether the reference was` available to the extent that persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject_matter or art [ ] exercising reasonable_diligence can locate it'
sri int l inc. v. internet sec
sys. inc. 511_f.3d_1186 1194 fed.cir.2008 quoting bruckelmyer v. ground heaters inc. 445_f.3d_1374 1378 fed.cir.2006
thus while often relevant to public_accessibility evidence of indexing is not an absolute prerequisite to establishing online_references like the benson_article as printed publications within the prior_art

here the evidence of record supports the district_courts conclusion that the benson_article was publicly accessible before the december 7 1999 critical_date-one year before the earliest priority date for the ¡¬ 449 patent-and therefore qualified as prior_art under ¡± 102 b
the benson_article was posted to the risks_digest by tom_benson on march_4,_1986
at that time the risks_digest was distributed online via a subscription mailing list and also made available for download through an ftp site maintained by sri international
starting in january 1995 however all content published in the risks_digest including the benson_article became available worldwide on the internet through the website http //catless.ncl.ac
uk/risks
furthermore unrebutted testimony in the record indicated that 1 the risks_digest was well known to the community interested in the risks of computer automation including those concerned with electronic_voting technologies and by 1999 the risks_digest contained more than 100 articles relating to electronic_voting ; 2 all submissions for publication in the risks_digest are treated by the community as public disclosures ; and users can freely *1381 and easily copy risks_digest content
in addition since september 1995 the risks_digest_website has included a search tool that would have retrieved the benson_article in response to search terms such as` vote'` voting'` ballot' and/or` election'
on the other hand although commercial internet search engines were available by 1999 the record is devoid of evidence indicating whether or not the risks_digest_website had been indexed by any such services as of the critical_date
the district_court credited each of the preceding factual assertions as it was entitled to do

given the record before us we see no error in the district_courts factual findings or its conclusion that the benson_article constituted publicly available prior_art relative to the ¡¬449_patent
the risks_digest_website was undisputedly open to any internet user by the critical_date
whether or not the website itself had been indexed by 1999 through search engines or otherwise the uncontested evidence indicates that a person of ordinary_skill interested in electronic_voting would have been independently aware of the risks_digest as a prominent forum for discussing such technologies
and upon accessing the risks_digest_website such an interested researcher would have found the benson_article using that websites own search functions and applying reasonable_diligence
in short the benson_article was publicly available by the critical_date and therefore qualifies as a prior_art` printed publication' under ¡± 102 b

having correctly confirmed the benson_article as prior_art the district_court proceeded to hold claim 49 invalid as obvious in light of that reference
the court found` no differences between the claimed invention and the benson_article' based on its review of claim 49 the benson_article and what it considered to be persuasive testimony offered by the defendants expert
voter_verified presented no contrary evidence and points to none on appeal

in pertinent part the benson_article discloses
an electronic_voting booth with a screen and some sort of simple keyboard..
the voter fills in his or her choices and has a chance to go back and correct errors
at that point the voter pushes a button to confirm the ballot and a printer prints card ballot which it retains behind a transparent screen it can be read but not altered
voter scans the printed card and is asked whether it is accurate
at this point if it is not a revise or cancel button is pushed and the process starts over with nothing having been recorded the card is shredded
when the screen and card match the voters intentions a second confirm button is pushed and the card is ejected while the vote is electronically forwarded
the voter takes the card out of the booth and drops it in a ballot box
tom_benson computerized voting risks_digest mar._4,_1986 4:27 pm http // catless.ncl.ac.uk/risks/2.22.html # subj3.1
while the disclosures in the benson_article are not identical with the language of claim 49 we agree with the district_court that the benson_article would have made the voting method of claim 49 obvious to one of ordinary_skill in the art of computerized voting technology
accordingly the district_court correctly held claim 49 invalid for obviousness

2
claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92
premier and election_systems argue in their cross-appeals that the district *1382 court erroneously granted summary_judgment in favor of voter_verified on the validity of claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92
premier and election_systems contend that because voter_verified 1 was not actively asserting most of those claims and 2 had moved to terminate the case the district_court lacked jurisdiction to make its ruling on validity
we disagree

the initial complaint in this case alleged infringement of every claim of the ¡¬449_patent and while voter_verified later pared back its infringement contentions it did so with the caveat that discovery might dictate reintroducing` other claims in the patents in suit'
in addition premier and election_systems kept any` unasserted' claims before the district_court by maintaining their respective counterclaims that alleged invalidity of` [ e ] ach claim of the ¡¬449_patent'
when voter_verified moved for summary_judgment on those counterclaims premier and election_systems never responded with viable arguments or evidence to support their invalidity contentions regarding claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92 despite multiple opportunities to do so.3

as the district_court recognized it was ultimately up to premier and election_systems to establish each of their invalidity_counterclaims by clear and convincing_evidence ; yet they failed to mount a response to voter_verifieds summary_judgment_motion on the claims now at issue
furthermore we fail to see how voter_verifieds intervening motion to suspend or terminate the proceedings for appeal-a motion that was never granted-absolves premier and election_systems of that fundamental burden
because premier and election_systems failed to adequately support their own counterclaims the district_court did not err by granting voter_verifieds summary_judgment_motion that claims 1-48 50-84 and 86-92 were not proven invalid

b. noninfringement
voter_verified next challenges the district_courts judgment that the defendants do not infringe claims 1-93 of the ¡¬449_patent
voter_verified has not substantively disputed that judgment on appeal as it applies to claims 56-84 and we therefore deem any challenge regarding those claims waived
we address the remaining claims as set forth below and affirm the judgment of noninfringement

1
claims 1-48
independent_claims 1_and_25 claim` self-verifying voting_system [ s ]' and each requires inter alia` a ballot_scanning_means' that allows the claimed system to read a printed ballot for comparison to the voters input as recorded by the voting_station computer
the district_court construed` ballot_scanning_means' pursuant to 35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
6 and held that the accused systems lacked any` ballot_scanning_machine' or equivalent corresponding structure capable of carrying out the claimed function of reading votes on a printed ballot

on appeal voter_verified agrees with the district_courts claim construction analysis and concedes that the accused systems lack any ballot_scanning device
what the district_court failed to appreciate according to voter_verified is that the ¡¬449_patent sets forth the voter as an` alternative and equivalent' structure for carrying out the claimed ballot_scanning *1383 function
voter_verified asserts that` [ c ] omparison by the voter of the printed votes.. with those displayed as recorded on the [ accused systems ] occurs with the voters visual examination of each to ascertain any differences between them' thus infringing claims 1_and_25 literally or at least under the doctrine of equivalents

the district_court rejected voter_verifieds argument and so do we
it is well established that` a human being can not constitute ameans` within the scope of ¡± 112 ?
6 default proof credit card sys. inc. v. home depot u.s.a. inc. 412_f.3d_1291 1300 fed.cir.2005 which in itself would suffice to dispose of voter_verifieds infringement theory
but even assuming that a human voter could be considered a permissible structure claims 1_and_25 further require that the printed ballot and electronically stored vote be` compared by the computer_program` and that the scanning means be` connect [ ed ]' to the computer
¡¬449_patent_col. 6_ll._46 -50 col. 8_ll._24 -28 emphasis added
voter_verified has not credibly explained and the specification does not address how a human could be connected to a computer much less in a manner that would effect a computerized analysis upon his or her examination of a printed ballot

accordingly the defendants were entitled to summary_judgment of noninfringement regarding claims 1_and_25 because none of the accused products includes a ballot_scanning device or its equivalent
furthermore because they do not infringe those independent_claims the defendants also can not infringe associated dependent claims 2-big_token__24_and_26__big_token -48 as a matter of law
wahpeton canvas co. v. frontier inc. 870_f.2d_1546 1552_n._9_(fed.cir.1989)

2
claims 49-big_token__55_and_85__big_token -93
independent_claims 49 85 and 93 recite methods for voting each explicitly requiring that several of the claimed steps must be performed` by the voter'
for example claims 49 85 and 93 each require an essentially identical step in which the voter decides whether a printed ballot is an acceptable or unacceptable representation of his or her intended vote.4 recognizing that infringement of claims 49 85 and 93 would thus require multiple actors the district_court looked to our decisions in bmc resources inc. v. paymentech l.p. 498_f.3d_1373_(fed.cir.2007) and muniauction inc. v. thomson corp. 532_f.3d_1318_(fed.cir.2008) and held that even if a voter performed every step required by the claimed methods voter_verified had not presented sufficient evidence of control or direction to attribute any of those actions to the defendants
consequently the court granted summary_judgment of noninfringement in favor of the defendants

on appeal voter_verified contends that` it is axiomatic that all entities who conduct elections must necessarily be in control of their election process' suggesting that it follows that` the computer_program of the [ accused system ] controls all of the voters actions.. to complete the process of voting'

as we held in bmc and muniauction liability for direct_infringement of a method claim requires that one party *1384 either performs every step of the claimed method or exerts` direction or control' over any such steps performed by others
see muniauction 532 f.3d at 1329` where the actions of multiple parties combine to perform every step of a claimed method the claim is directly infringed only if one party exercisescontrol or direction over the entire process..' citing bmc 498 f.3d at 1380-81
that is far from the case before us
notwithstanding voter_verifieds conclusory arguments that the defendants necessarily` control [ ] all of the voters actions' the record shows at most that the defendants provide instructions on how to use their systems
but the fact that an accused infringer` controls access to its system and instructs [ others ] on its use is not sufficient to incur liability for direct_infringement'
id.at 1330

the district_court thus correctly concluded that voter_verified failed to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the defendants exercised the requisite_control or direction over voters to directly infringe claims 49 85 and 93
as such claims 50-big_token__55_and_86__big_token -92 which depend from claims 49_and_85 also were not directly infringed for at least the same reasons.5

c. remaining issues
finally voter_verified has disputed no fewer than seventeen6 of the district_courts discretionary rulings on various motions including procedural and discovery issues asserting that` there is hardly a single ruling in this case in favor of the defendants that is not marred by an abuse of discretion..
such an abuse of discretion has now attained the dimension of bias favoring the defendants or their counsel'
a claim of seventeen procedural errors by a district_court seems unlikely at best ; however we take such allegations seriously
we have therefore carefully considered the record before us and we conclude that voter_verifieds contentions are wholly without merit
we perceive no error in any of the contested orders much less anything approaching an abuse of the district_courts considerable discretion in such matters

conclusion
we have considered each of the parties remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive
*1385 in view of the foregoing the judgment of the district_court is affirmed

affirmed
