background
in the early 1980s kumar discovered that the use of certain rare_earth-transition metal alloys to store hydrogen in rechargeable_nickel_metal_hydride_batteries would overcome the inevitable fracturing associated with repeated recharging
prior art alloys had a crystalline molecular structure meaning that their molecules were arranged in a regular repeating pattern
these prior_art crystalline_alloys degraded severely with the repeated cycles of hydrogen storage and release that accompanied recharging
kumar found that certain alloys with a less ordered molecular structure were immune to material fracture and had improved hydrogen storage capacity
kumar applied for a patent on this invention in 1981 and the ¡¬686_patent issued on january 21 1986
in the patent that finally issued he chose to describe these alloys as` amorphous'
independent claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬686_patent read as follows 1
a system for retrievably storing hydrogen_comprising an amorphous_rare_earth-transition_metal_alloy_material ; a container for said material and
means for supplying hydrogen to said material and exhausting hydrogen from said material for respective absorption and desorption thereby
'686_patent col._5,_ll._17-24 emphasis added
6
a process for reversibly storing hydrogen in an amorphous_rare_earth-transition_metal_alloy_material comprising the steps of supplying hydrogen to amorphous_rare_earth-transition_metal_alloy_material in a closed system cycling said hydrogen over said alloy_material to cause hydrogen to be stored in said alloy_material ; and withdrawing hydrogen from said system to retrieve the stored hydrogen
id. col._6,_ll._12-20 emphasis added

ovonic the alleged infringer here sought patents in the same field
ovonic is the owner of u.s._patent_no._4623,597 the` ¡¬597_patent` issued on november 18 1986 on a rechargeable hydrogen battery comprising at least one anode for reversibly electrochemically charging and discharging hydrogen said anode comprising a disordered_multicomponent_material said disordered_multicomponent_material having at least one structure from the group consisting of amorphous microcrystalline polycrystalline lacking long-range_order compositional order with three or more phases of said polycrystalline structure and any combination of said amorphous microcrystalline and polycrystalline structures..597_patent col._13,_l._60- col._14,_l._2 emphasis added
in 1994 ovonic filed another rechargeable battery application that matured into u.s. patent no._5840,440 the` ¡¬440_patent` in 1998
this patent claimed in relevant part` [ a ] n improved high capacity hydrogen storage material' consisting of alloys with a` crystallite size.. less than 200 angstroms [ 20nm ]'
¡¬440_patent col._13,_l._56- col._14,_l._2 9
kumar sued ovonic in the district court of massachusetts for direct contributory and induced_infringement of the ¡¬686_patent asserting in part that ovonics grants of licenses under the ¡¬597 and ¡¬440_patent s constituted infringement of the ¡¬ 686 patent

ovonic filed a motion for summary_judgment of non-infringement
ovonic urged *1367 that the term` amorphous' alloys in the ¡¬686_patent should be construed to mean` completely' amorphous i.e. where there is no ordering of molecules and that ovonic did not infringe the ¡¬686_patent because the batteries produced under its licenses did not use completely amorphous_alloys
kumar v. ovonic_battery_co. inc. no._01- cv-11247-mel slip op.at 4 d.mass
july_8,_2002
kumar urged that the term` amorphous' was not limited to completely amorphous_alloys but instead should be construed to cover all partially crystalline_alloys with long_range_order less than 100 nm which would have included alloys described in the ¡¬597 and ¡¬440_patent s and used in ovonics batteries
id.at 6
ovonic also argued that it was not liable for infringement because it had merely patented and licensed the batteries that were accused of infringement
id.at 4_n._2 citing 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 a which defines infringement as` mak [ ing ] us [ ing ] offer [ ing ] to sell or sell [ ing ] any patented invention'
the district_court construed the ¡¬686_patent claims as urged by ovonic
the court found that the ¡¬686_patents specification and prosecution_history supported ovonics definition of amorphous whereas kumars definition had been` developed after his patent was filed and therefore [ could not ] be taken to describe accurately what he sought to patent'
id.at 7 emphasis in original
the court granted summary_judgment of non-infringement based on its claim_construction and did not decide whether ovonics licensing actions would have made it liable for infringement under kumars proposed claim_construction explaining that the latter question raised` disputes of material fact'
id.at 4_n._2

we review the district_courts grant of summary_judgment without deference
inverness_med
switz
gmbh v. warner lambert co. 309_f.3d_1373 1377 fed.cir.2002` inverness_ii'

the central question here is one of claim_construction specifically the meaning of the term` amorphous' in claims 1_and_6 of the ¡¬ 686 patent
claim construction is a question of law that this court reviews without deference
markman v. westview instruments inc. 52_f.3d_967 979 fed.cir.1995 en banc affd 517_u.s._370 116_s.ct._1384 134_l.ed.2d_577_(1996)
under our precedent in texas digital sys. inc. v. telegenix inc. 308_f.3d_1193 1201-02 fed.cir.2002 and inverness_ii 309 f.3d at 1378 we look first to the dictionary definition of a contested term
ovonic urges that the correct definition appears in websters third_new_international_dictionary defining amorphous as` without real or apparent crystalline form uncrystallized'
websters third_new_international_dictionary 72 1981
ovonic argues that this definition means that amorphous_alloys must be completely lacking in crystalline structure
kumar on the other hand points out that the ¡¬686_patent referenced the polk_patent u.s._patent_no._4116,682 issued sept._26,_1978 the` polk_patent' as prior_art ; that the polk_patent was extensively discussed and distinguished during prosecution ; and that the polk_patent specifically defined a` solid amorphous metal' as one` in which the constituent_atoms are arranged in a spatial_pattern that exhibits no long_range_order that is it is non-crystalline..
in distinguishing an amorphous substance from a crystalline substance x-ray diffraction measurements are generally employed'
polk_patent col._1,_ll._13-27 emphasis added

our cases have recognized that although the dictionary can be an important tool in claim_construction by providing a *1368 starting point for determining the ordinary_meaning of a term to a person of skill in the art` the intrinsic record' can resolve ambiguity in claim language or where clear trump an inconsistent dictionary definition

switz
gmbh v. princeton biomeditech corp. 309_f.3d_1365 1371-72 fed.cir.2002` inverness i'

our cases also establish that prior_art cited in a patent or cited in the prosecution_history of the patent constitutes intrinsic evidence
tate access floors inc. v. interface architectural res. inc. 279_f.3d_1357 1371-big_token__72_n._4_ fed.cir.2002 __big_token ; vitronics corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996 ; markman 52 f.3d at 979-80
for example in arthur a. collins inc. v. northern telecom ltd. 216_f.3d_1042_(fed.cir.2000) we rejected the district_courts claim_construction which` declined to consider the teachings of [ prior_art referenced in the patent ] to ascertain the meaning' of the claim_term` time-space-time tst switch'
id.at 1044
instead we interpreted the term based on its usage in the prior_art that was cited in the patent explaining that` [ w ] hen prior_art that sheds light on the meaning of a term is cited by the patentee it can have particular value as a guide to the proper construction of the term because it may indicate not only the meaning of the term to persons skilled in the art but also that the patentee intended to adopt that meaning'
id.at 1045

in the present case the polk_patent is not simply cited in the ¡¬686_patent as pertinent_prior_art ; nor is there any showing that the polk_patent adopted a special definition at variance with that prevailing in the art
rather the polk_patent was considered by both the applicant and the examiner to be highly pertinent_prior_art and there is no indication that the polk_patents express definition even if inconsistent with the general_dictionary_definition was in any way at variance with the definition that would have been used by those skilled in the art at the time
indeed as noted below ovonics own ¡¬440_patent though issued some few years after the issuance of the kumar patent uses the same definition thus at least suggesting that the` long_range_order' definition was not unique to the polk_patent

under these circumstances we conclude that the polk_patent_definition is to be preferred over the general_dictionary_definition relied upon by ovonic
this polk_patent_definition should control unless the specification clearly states an alternative meaning or this meaning was disclaimed during prosecution
see inverness i 309 f.3d at 1371-72
here the specification and prosecution_history do not require a different interpretation than the polk_patents definition of an amorphous alloy namely one` in which the constituent_atoms are arranged in a spatial_pattern that exhibits no long_range_order..' polk_patent col._1,_ll._13-15

ii
although it is firmly settled that an applicant may act as a lexicographer in the specification markman 52 f.3d at 980 the specification can not support a definition that is contrary to the ordinary_meaning of a claim_term unless it communicates a deliberate and clear preference for this alternative definition
apple computer inc. v. articulate sys. inc. 234_f.3d_14 21_n._5_(fed.cir.2000) citing renishaw plc v. marposs societa per azioni 158_f.3d_1243 1249 fed.cir.1998 for the proposition that in order to act as ones own lexicographer in the specification` a patentee must deliberately and clearly point out how these terms differ from the conventional understanding'
ovonic argues *1369 that the ¡¬686_specification requires that the term` amorphous' be interpreted to mean` completely' amorphous contrary to the polk_patent_definition
in support of this construction ovonic contends that the ¡¬686_specification defines the terms` amorphous' and` completely amorphous' in the same way as having a` random atomic' structure
ovonic cites the following passages from the ¡¬686_patent in support of this argument [ t ] he transformation to the low_temperature_crystalline_phase is suppressed to produce either a completely amorphous solid_state rare_earth-transition_metal_material characterized by the random_atomic_structure.. ¡¬686_patent col._2,_ll._19-22 emphases added
recent investigations of rare_earth-metal alloys has led to the discovery that the production of the alloy in its amorphous_state characterized by random_atomic_orientation as opposed to the regular_lattice_structure of the crystalline_state produces a material capable of absorbing substantially larger_quantities of hydrogen without any tendency to fracture..
id. col. 3 ii
5-12 emphases added

the difficulties with this argument are several
first our precedent teaches that qualifications such as` completely' or` normally' are to be given significance in interpreting the specification
see e-pass techs. inc. v. 3com corp. 343_f.3d_1364 1369 fed.cir.2003
second there is no indication in these passages or anywhere else in the specification that the term` completely amorphous' was used synonymously with the term` amorphous'
the fact that the ¡¬686_patent refers to the` random atomic' structure or orientation of both amorphous and completely amorphous_alloys does not indicate that the patent defines the terms interchangeably
the terms` random_atomic_structure' or` random_atomic_orientation' can themselves mean completely random or partially random

third in the very same portion of the specification where amorphous is defined by reference to` random atomic' structure the term` amorphous' is not used to distinguish material that is partially crystalline but rather material that is fully crystalline i.e. material characterized by` the regular_lattice_structure of the crystalline_state' and thus has a tendency to fracture.1

fourth significantly the specification distinguishes between` totally amorphous' material which is cooled at` [ t ] he more rapid_rate' approaching 108 degrees centigrade per second and` amorphous' material which is cooled over the much broader range of 106_to_108 degrees centigrade per second
¡¬686_patent col._3,_ll._17-27 ; col._4,_ll._30-35
this plainly suggests that` amorphous' and` totally amorphous' are not the same

finally only` totally' or` completely' amorphous_material is distinguished from partially crystalline_material
the following excerpts from the 686 specification illustrate this point [ t ] he transformation to the low_temperature_crystalline_phase is suppressed to produce either a completely amorphous solid_state rare_earth-transition_metal_material.. or to a partially crystallized *1370 or metastable_crystalline_state depending upon the specific cooling rate utilized
id. col._2,_ll._16-24 emphases added
the more rapid_rate produces a totally amorphous_state material from complete suppression of the transformation to the low_temperature_crystalline_phase
a partially crystallized or metastable_crystalline_state in which some crystalline_forms occurs from a less rapid_cooling..
id. col._4,_ll._30-35 emphases added

because the specification does not clearly and deliberately define the term` amorphous' as completely amorphous it does not support a construction of the term contrary to its plain_meaning as established in the polk_patent

nor is the term` amorphous' meaningfully defined in the specification by reference to its` random_atomic_structure'
id. col._2,_ll._19-22
the term` random_atomic_structure' is itself undefined in the specification which provides no guidance as to its definition beyond contrasting it with the` regular_lattice_structure of the crystalline_state'
id. col._3,_ll._7-10
as such amorphous_alloys with a` random_atomic_structure' 1 may encompass a broad range of alloys except those that are fully crystalline or alternatively 2 may encompass only those with a fully random structure
the specification provides no guidance as to which of these definitions or even some third definition is intended

iii
finally we turn to the prosecution_history
the relevant claims of kumars original patent application read as follows 1
in a system for retrievably storing hydrogen a material for the retrievable storage of hydrogen_comprising an alloy_material in a nonequilibrium atomic structure state
2
the system of claim 1 wherein said material is a rare_earth-transition metal
3
the system of claim 2 wherein said nonequilibrium rare_earth-transition_metal_material is in the amorphous_state
4
the system of claim 2 wherein said rare_earth-transition_metal_material is in a metastable_crystalline_state
app.at 171 emphases added
kumars application was rejected as obvious in light of the polk_patent
the examiner explained although the invention is not identically disclosed or described.. the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious..
the applicants arguments have been considered but [ sic ] not clear why unobvious to use alloys of polk et al in process [ sic ] of basic reference..
the amorphous_alloys claimed are old in the art.. id.at 189 emphasis added
although the examiners written comments did not suggest specific amendments kumar stated during prosecution that the examiner indicated in an oral interview that` if the claims were limited to amorphous rare-earth_transition_metal_alloys for reversible_storage of hydrogen.. they would likely be allowable'
id.at 224
accordingly kumar cancelled claims 2-4 among other claims and amended claim 1 to read` a system for retrievably storing hydrogen_comprising an amorphous_rare_earth-transition_metal_alloy_material..' id.at 223
all further references to alloys of a` nonequilibrium atomic structure' or their` metastable_crystalline_state' were excised from the claims

*1371 ovonic argues that the surrender of claims to` metastable_crystalline' alloys effectively surrendered claims to all partially crystalline_alloys.2 kumars theory is that metastable_crystalline and partially crystalline are mutually exclusive_categories of alloys and that he therefore did not surrender partially crystalline_alloys by surrendering` metastable_crystalline' alloys during prosecution
appellants reply_br.at 19-20
we do not agree that in the present context metastable_crystalline_alloys and partially crystalline_alloys were used as mutually exclusive_categories
the specification repeatedly equates partially crystalline with metastable_crystalline stating that` the transformation to the low_temperature_crystalline_phase is suppressed to produce.. a partially crystallized or metastable_crystalline_state' ¡¬686_patent col._2,_ll._17-24 emphasis added and that` [ a ] partially crystallized or metastable_crystalline_state in which some crystalline_forms occurs from a less rapid_cooling..' id. col._4,_ll._33 emphasis added
however the mere fact that a party offers incorrect theories based on the specification and prosecution_history to support a particular claim_construction here the polk_definition does not require that we reject that particular construction
just as we may consider` new or additional arguments in support of the scope of [ a partys ] claim_construction on appeal' inverness_ii 309 f.3d at 1381 quoting ccs fitness inc. v. brunswick corp. 288_f.3d_1359 1370-71 fed.cir.2002 internal citations omitted we may also consider our own independent analysis of the prosecution_history to conclude that a partys proffered claim_construction is correct
that is the situation here
although we reject kumars interpretation of the prosecution_history we also do not think ovonics interpretation is correct
even assuming that metastable_crystalline and partially crystalline were used as synonyms the prosecution_history and the specification is equally consistent with an interpretation that metastable_crystalline or partially crystalline is a broad term including any material that is not fully crystalline
to be sure it would include amorphous_material exhibiting some very limited degree of crystallinity but would exclude material that was completely or totally amorphous
but by surrendering the broad claims to metastable_crystalline and partially crystalline kumar did not surrender everything within the scope of metastable_crystalline and partially crystalline
in other words kumar surrendered a broad claim covering all partially crystalline_material but did not thereby surrender the subset of such material within the scope of the definition of` amorphous'
at most the prosecution_history is confusing in this respect and the surrender is not clear and convincing as required by our cases
see omega eng g inc v. raytek corp. 334_f.3d_1314 1323-25 fed.cir.2003

ovonic further argues that kumar surrendered partially crystalline_alloys by following the examiners suggestion to limit his claims to` amorphous rare-earth_transition_metal_alloys for the reversible_storage of hydrogen'
as ovonic admits however there is nothing in the prosecution_history that defines the term` amorphous'
we have held that` [ i ] t is inappropriate to limit a broad definition of a claim_term based on prosecution_history that is itself ambiguous' as it is in this case
inverness_ii 309 f.3d at 1382

accordingly neither the prosecution_history nor the specification supports a definition *1372 of amorphous contrary to the plain_meaning as defined by the polk_patent

iv
this is not the end of the matter
questions remain as to the meaning of the phrase` long_range_order' in the polk_definition
kumar contends that lack of long_range_order exists when` sizes of ordered regions [ are ] below 100 nm'
in support of this definition kumar relies on statements in two textbooks,3 an article he had published before filing the application that gave rise to the ¡¬686_patent4 and the language of a prior patent.5 but none of these sources provides a clear definition of the term
we conclude that testimony from those skilled in the art is required to establish the meaning of the term` long_range_order' a term which we note was used in one of ovonics own patents
¡¬440_patent col._3,_ll._26-32` [ t ] he types of disordered structures that provide local structural chemical environments for improved hydrogen storage characteristics include amorphous_materials microcrystalline_materials multicomponent multiphase polycrystalline_materials lacking long range composition order..' emphasis added ; see vitronics 90 f.3d at 1584

v. ovonic contends that it has not infringed because the mere act of licensing can not constitute infringement irrespective of the definition of amorphous
kumar maintains that the licensing itself was sufficient to constitute contributory and induced_infringement
see 5 donald s. chisum chisum on patents ¡± 17.04 [ 4 ] [ a ] 2002
we do not decide this question on the present record
we note that kumar also argues that ovonic is liable for infringement because it did more than merely license patents
kumar alleges that ovonic` experimented extensively with the ¡¬686_patents *1373 alloys and profited from it' ; that ovonic` suppl [ ied ] their licensees' with infringing battery components ; and that ovonics` products most likely contain [ infringing alloys ] as well'
appellants reply_br.at 5-7
although ovonic submitted an affidavit of non-infringement stating that it` did not use any amorphous_rare_earth-transition_metal_alloy_materials in any of its batteries' app.at 113 it conceded at oral argument that this statement was made using ovonics definition of amorphous and that the affidavit in any event covered only completed batteries
because we have not adopted ovonics definition we do not agree with ovonic that the affidavit constitutes evidence that its batteries do not infringe
there was no basis therefore for granting summary_judgment of non-infringement

conclusion
accordingly we vacate the district_courts grant of summary_judgment and remand for further_proceedings consistent with this opinion

vacated and remanded

costs
no costs

bryson circuit_judge concurring
i concur in the courts decision to remand this case for further_proceedings and in much of the courts analysis
i agree with the court that the evidence indicates that the term` amorphous' was understood at the time of the application to mean` lacking in long-range_order' although my conclusion is based on the totality of the evidence presented to the district_court and not principally on the polk_patent which is cited in the ¡¬686_patent only in the` references cited' section and which was referred to in the prosecution_history not for definitional purposes but in connection with the issue of obviousness
i also agree with the court that defining` amorphous' alloys as` lacking in long-range_order' is not sufficient without more to determine whether ovonics accused products infringe ; the court properly holds that the district_court will have to determine with more specificity what` long-range_order' denotes and thus what structures fall within the scope of the asserted claims of the ¡¬686_patent
finally i agree with the court in rejecting dr. kumars argument that the terms` partially crystallized' and` metastable_crystalline' as used in the ¡¬686_patent are mutually exclusive and that the claim_term` amorphous' must be understood to include all alloys that are` partially crystallized' as well as those that are` totally amorphous'

although i agree that a remand is necessary i would expand the scope of the remand in one respect
the specification expressly defines the term` amorphous' as` characterized by random_atomic_orientation'
the court concludes that that definition is not meaningful because it lacks specificity
but that is not a sufficient reason to disregard the definition altogether
the definition of` amorphous' as` lacking in long-range_order' also lacks specificity standing alone which is why a remand for supplementation of that definition is necessary
and the` random_atomic_orientation' definition has an advantage over the` long-range_order' definition in that the former is specifically referenced in the patent while the latter is not
accordingly i would include within the scope of the remand the task of determining whether to persons skilled in the field of amorphous solids the phrase` random_atomic_orientation' is indicative of a particular class of structures
it may turn out that the phrase` random_atomic_orientation' is too indefinite to provide any significant guidance as to the bounds of the claim *1374 term` amorphous'
but if there was a general_understanding in the field as to the meaning of that phrase at the time of the application it should be employed along with the general_understanding of the meaning of` lacking in long-range_order' as a basis for construing the critical language of the asserted claims
