opinion
rader circuit_judge
on summary_judgment the united_states_district_court for the southern_district of new_york found in favor of plaintiffs eisai_co. ltd. and eisai inc. collectively eisai with respect to the validity and enforceability of u.s. patent no._5045,552552_patent
eisai_co. v. teva pharms

9053 s.d.n.y
oct._5,_2006 sj_enforceability_order
after a bench_trial the district_court found that dr._reddys laboratories ltd. and dr._reddys laboratories inc. collectively dr._reddys and teva_pharmaceuticals_usa inc. teva had failed to prove the remaining allegations of inequitable_conduct and that eisai had established that dr._reddys and teva infringed eisais ¡¬552_patent
eisai_co. v. dr._reddys labs. ltd. no._03_civ
9053 2007_wl_1406565_(s.d.n.y._may_11,_2007) trial_order
because the district_court correctly determined that the ¡¬552_patent is non-obvious over the proffered prior_art and that eisais alleged acts during prosecution did not rise to the level of inequitable_conduct this court affirms

*1356 i
the ¡¬552_patent claims rabeprazole and its salts
rabeprazole is part of a class of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors which suppress gastric acid production by inhibiting action of the enzyme h +k+atpase
the distinctions between rabeprazole and its salts are not relevant for this appeal
therefore this court refers to rabeprazole and its salts collectively as` rabeprazole'
rabeprazoles sodium salt is the active_ingredient in aciphex a pharmaceutical approved in 1991 by the fda for the treatment of duodenal_ulcers heartburn and associated disorders
aciphex has been a commercial success garnering over $ 1 billion in worldwide yearly sales

dr._reddys and teva each filed abbreviated new drug applications andas under the hatch-waxman act 21 u.s.c.¡± 355_and_35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e seeking to manufacture a generic version of aciphex before the expiration of the ¡¬552_patent
because filing an anda is an artificial but legally cognizable act of patent infringement see glaxo group ltd. v. apotex inc. 376_f.3d_1339 1344 2004 eisai filed suit against dr._reddys and teva
eisai also sued mylan laboratories inc. and mylan pharmaceuticals inc. collectively mylan another anda filer but that proceeding was stayed pending the outcome of these actions
mylan agreed to be bound by the final judgments and any appeals in these cases
eisai_co. ltd. v. mylan labs. inc. no._04 civ
656 s.d.n.y
nov._3,_2004
both dr._reddys and teva conceded infringement of claims 1-6 of the ¡¬552_patent but asserted that the ¡¬552_patent is unenforceable for inequitable_conduct
trial_order at 6-7
dr._reddys stipulated to the validity of all six of the ¡¬552_patents claims id.at 6 but teva argued before the district_court and maintains on appeal that the ¡¬552_patent is invalid for obviousness
both dr._reddys and teva appeal the trial_courts judgments of enforceability
neither dr._reddys nor teva appeals the trial_courts judgment of infringement
this court has jurisdiction under 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

ii
this court reviews a grant of summary_judgment without deference
dayco prods. inc. v. total containment inc. 329_f.3d_1358 1362 fed.cir.2003
obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a is ultimately a legal question based on underlying factual_determinations
see richardson-vicks inc. v. upjohn co. 122_f.3d_1476 1479 fed.cir.1997
the factual_determinations underpinning the legal conclusion of obviousness include 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and 4 evidence of secondary factors also known as objective indicia of non-obviousness
graham v. john deere co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
thus in reviewing a district_courts summary_judgment of non-obviousness this court reviews the record for genuine issues of material_fact without deference bearing in mind the movants burden to prove invalidity by clear and convincing_evidence
see monarch knitting mach corp. v. sulzer morat gmbh 139_f.3d_877 881 fed.cir.1998

where as here the patent at issue claims a chemical_compound the analysis of the third graham factor the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art often turns on the structural similarities and differences between the claimed compound and the prior_art *1357 compounds
see eli lilly & co. v. zenith goldline pharms. inc. 471_f.3d_1369 1377 fed.cir.2006 noting that for a chemical_compound a prima_facie_case of obviousness requires` structural_similarity between claimed and prior_art subject matter.. where the prior_art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions' quoting in re dillon 919_f.2d_688 692 fed.cir.1990 en banc
obviousness based on structural_similarity thus can be proved by identification of some motivation that would have led one of ordinary_skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound i.e
a lead_compound in a particular way to achieve the claimed compound
see takeda chem
indus
v. alphapharm pty. ltd. 492_f.3d_1350 1356 fed.cir.2007
in keeping with the flexible nature of the obviousness_inquiry ksr int l co. v. teleflex inc. 550_u.s._398 127_s.ct._1727 1739 167_l.ed.2d_705_(2007) the requisite motivation can come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be explicit in the art
see aventis pharma deutschland gmbh v. lupin ltd. 499_f.3d_1293 1301 fed.cir.2007
rather` it is sufficient to show that the claimed and prior_art compounds possess asufficiently close relationship.. to create an expectation in light of the totality of the prior_art that the new compound will havesimilar properties to the old'
id
( quoting dillon 919 f.2d at 692

teva asserts that a combination of three prior_art references renders the ¡¬552_patent obvious 1 european patent no._174726 owned by takeda claiming lansoprazole ep_¡¬726 ; 2 united states patent no._4255,431 to junggren claiming omeprazole431_patent ; and 3 an article by brandstrom et al. entitled` structure activity relationships of substituted benzimidazoles' brandstrom
ep_¡¬726 teaches inter alia the ulcer treatment compound lansoprazole
lansoprazole differs structurally from rabeprazole at the 4-position on the pyridine_ring as indicated in the diagram below
lansoprazole has a trifluoroethoxy och2cf3 substituent whereas rabeprazole has a methoxypropoxy och2ch2ch2 och3 substituent

?
appellant tevas br.at 28
otherwise the two compounds are identical
see sj_validity_order at 7
both rabeprazole and lansoprazole are` asymmetrically substituted' with respect to the 4-position on the pyridine_ring because the substituent at the 3-position a methyl group in both compounds is not the same as the substituent at the 5-position a hydrogen in both compounds

the ¡¬431_patent discloses a broad class of gastric acid inhibiting compounds including omeprazole the first commercial proton pump inhibitor sold as prilosec
although sharing the same basic structure omeprazole is structurally farther afield from rabeprazole than is lansoprazole
for instance omeprazoles pyridine_ring is symmetrically substituted and has a methoxy och3 group at the 4-position

finally brandstrom describes a class of anti-ulcerative compounds having a benzimidazole-sulfinylmethyl-pyridine core the brandstrom core structure

*1358. ?
rabeprazole lansoprazole and omeprazole are all brandstrom core structure compounds
taking the evidence in the light most favorable to teva this court assumes that as per ep_¡¬726 lansoprazole is twenty times superior to omeprazole for anti-ulcer action as measured by an indomethacin-induced gastric lesion assay in rats
this court also assumes that lansoprazole has certain traits including lipophilicity the ability of a compound to cross lipid membranes and low molecular weight that would have made it desirable to a skilled_artisan

under these assumptions one of skill in this art may have considered it a candidate for a lead_compound in the search for anti-ulcer compounds
to the contrary the district_court emphasized the differences between anti-ulcer action and gastric acid inhibition
the trial_court specifically noted that tevas expert testified with respect to the ep_¡¬726 data that` [ t ] he level of acid secretion.. from these [ anti-ulcer ] data.. can not be determined'
sj_validity_order at 13
in this context this court consults the counsel of ksr that` any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed'
127 s.ct.at 1742
thus lansoprazoles candidacy as a starting_point to develop new anti-ulcer compounds versus new gastric acid inhibitors does not resolve the lead_compound analysis at least not in the absence of any contrary indications
cf
takeda 492 f.3d at 1359 negative side effects could dissuade one of skill from using a particular compound as a starting_point

nonetheless as the district_court noted the ep_¡¬726 reference teaches at best that the fluorinated_substituent of lansoprazole provides` a special path to achieving lipophilicity'
sj_validity_order at 10 emphasis in original
and tevas expert identified a separate reference teaching that fluorine-substituted groups increase lipophilicity
id
the record however shows no discernible reason for a skilled_artisan to begin with lansoprazole only to drop the very feature the fluorinated_substituent that gave this advantageous property
indeed tevas pharmacology_expert dr. john forte declined to opine on lansoprazoles relevance to an examiner assessing the patentability of rabeprazole
j.a.at 14894
and dr._reddys pharmacology_expert dr. simmy bank testified in deposition that` i thought [ lansoprazole ] had nothing to do with this trial'
j.a.at 14756

this court notes that the district_court did not rigidly limit tevas obviousness arguments by forcing teva to select a single lead_compound
rather teva alone *1359 selected lansoprazole as the anchor for its obviousness theory not the district_court
in ksr the supreme_court noted that an invention may have been obvious` [ w ] hen there [ was ].. a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there [ were ].. a finite_number of identified predictable_solutions'
127 s.ct.at 1742 tense changes supplied to clarify as the court stated and as per 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 that the obviousness_inquiry must rely on evidence available` at the time' of the invention see takeda 492 f.3d at 1356_n._2
the supreme_courts analysis in ksr thus relies on several assumptions about the prior_art landscape
first ksr assumes a starting reference point or points in the art prior to the time of invention from which a skilled_artisan might identify a problem and pursue potential_solutions
second ksr presupposes that the record up to the time of invention would give some reasons available within the knowledge of one of skill in the art to make particular modifications to achieve the claimed compound
see takeda 492 f.3d at 1357` thus in cases involving new chemical_compounds it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness of a new claimed compound`
third the supreme_courts analysis in ksr presumes that the record before the time of invention would supply some reasons for narrowing the prior_art universe to a` finite_number of identified predictable_solutions' 127 s.ct.at 1742
in ortho-mcneil pharmaceutical inc. v. mylan laboratories inc. 520_f.3d_1358 1364 fed.cir.2008 this court further explained that this` easily traversed small and finite_number of alternatives.. might support an inference of obviousness'
to the extent an art is unpredictable as the chemical arts often are ksrs focus on these` identified predictable_solutions' may present a difficult hurdle because potential_solutions are less likely to be genuinely predictable

in other words post-ksr a prima_facie_case of obviousness for a chemical_compound still in general begins with the reasoned identification of a lead_compound
teva can not create a genuine issue of material_fact on obviousness through the unsupported assertion that compounds other than lansoprazole might have served as lead_compounds
further the record contains no reasons a skilled_artisan would have considered modification of lansoprazole by removing the lipophilicity-conferring fluorinated_substituent as an identifiable predictable solution
in sum the district_court properly concluded that the record did not support a case of obviousness of the ¡¬552_patent as a matter of law

iii
as with other summary_judgment issues this court reviews a district_courts summary_judgment on inequitable_conduct without deference
innogenetics n.v. v. abbott labs. 512_f.3d_1363 1378 fed.cir.2008
in contrast where a judgment regarding inequitable_conduct follows a bench_trial this court reviews the district_courts findings of materiality and intent for clear error and its ultimate conclusion for an abuse of discretion
acco brands inc. v. aba locks mfrs co. 501_f.3d_1307 1314 fed.cir.2007

inequitable conduct in prosecuting a patent_application before the united states patent & trademark office may take the form of an affirmative misrepresentation of material_fact a failure to disclose material information or the submission *1360 of false material information but in every case this false or misleading material communication or failure to communicate must be coupled with an intent to deceive
innogenetics 512 f.3d at 1378 citations omitted
materiality defined as` what a reasonable_examiner would have considered important in deciding whether to allow a patent_application' and intent are both questions of fact and require proof by clear and convincing_evidence
id
to satisfy the` intent' prong for unenforceability` the involved conduct viewed in light of all the evidence including evidence indicative of good faith must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive'
kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 fed.cir.1988 en banc citing norton v. curtiss 57_c.c.p.a._1384 433_f.2d_779_(1970)
gross negligence is not sufficient
id
this is a high bar

on appeal teva and dr._reddys allege that eisai misled the patent_office in five ways 1 failing to disclose eisais own co-pending ¡¬013_application which claimed the` ethyl homolog' of rabeprazole compound_shka 661 ; 2 withholding rejections from the ¡¬013_applications prosecution that also would have been applicable to the ¡¬552_patents prosecution ; 3 failing to disclose the prior_art` byk_gulden_patent' wo 8602646 ; 4 submitting a misleading declaration the fujisaki_declaration to the examiner of the ¡¬552_patent ; and 5 concealing lansoprazole from the examiner
the district_court rejected the fifth assertion on summary_judgment sj_enforceability_order at 58 and the other four after a bench_trial trial_order

teva and dr._reddys first and second allegations rely on eisais failure to disclose the fact of and rejections contained in eisais patent_application claiming the` ethyl homolog' of rabeprazole
known to eisais scientists as compound_shka 661 the ethyl homolog differs from rabeprazole as its name suggests
shka 661 has one fewer methylene unit at the 4-position of the pyridine_ring giving shka 661 an ethoxy group rather than a propoxy group at this position
the district_court correctly pointed out that calling shka 661 the` ethyl homolog' of rabeprazole in this case could carry a misleading implication with respect to inequitable_conduct
the record supplies no evidence to suggest that eisais scientists ever referred to shka 661 by this name or thought of shka 661 and rabeprazole` primarily in relation to each other'
trial_order at 17_n._7
rather the district_court found credible the testimony that eisai scientists considered shka 661 separately patentable even though eisai ultimately did not pursue that course
id.at 22-23 ; 42-43
furthermore even if a provisional obviousness-type double-patenting rejection might have issued in the prosecution of the ¡¬552_patent due to the co-pending shka 661 application the district_court found the materiality of this potential situation low because applicants routinely overcome this type of rejection id.at 44 by amending claims or filing a terminal disclaimer
nonetheless the district_court did not hold that the fact of the copendency of these two applications to be totally immaterial accurately noting that applicants should be encouraged to disclose closely related applications
id.at 47

while disclosure of the co-pending shka 661 application to the patent_office during the prosecution of the ¡¬552_patent would have been prudent eisais failure to do so is by no means fatal for two reasons
first the district_court had ample evidence from which to conclude that the materiality of the shka 611 application *1361 was low as outlined above
second the record is devoid of any real suggestion of intent to deceive the patent_office much less the clear and convincing_evidence required to support a finding of inequitable_conduct

as for the rejections of the ¡¬013_application that would have been relevant to the prosecution of the ¡¬552_patent the district_court did not reach materiality because it discerned insufficient proof of intent to deceive
the district_court found the documentary evidence faxed exchange between eisai employees mr. shuhei miyazawa one of the inventors of the ¡¬552_patent and mr. mitsuo taniguchi eisais patent agent regarding mr. miyazawas presentation to a pharmaceutical trade industry group to supply no compelling evidence of intent based on testimony from both parties to the fax
witness credibility determinations lie squarely within the district_courts discretion
see medichem s.a. v. rolabo s.l. 437_f.3d_1157 1171 fed.cir.2006
the district_court was ultimately undisturbed by the taniguchi/miyazawa communication based on its evaluation of the witness testimony presented and this court sees no abuse of discretion
these facts certainly do not rise to the level of` culpability' this court required in kingsdown 863 f.2d at 876 to establish intent to deceive or even gross negligence

finally the district_court found that tevas theory that eisai deliberately hid the ball from the patent_office by separately filing the ¡¬552 and ¡¬013 prosecutions to be` implausibly risky' given that such similar applications would usually be assigned to the same examiner in the same art unit
trial_order at 53
the district_court thus had ample bases from which to conclude that eisais failure to disclose its co-pending ¡¬013_application along with the rejections issued in its prosecution while not completely forthcoming did not rise to the level of inequitable_conduct

with respect to the byk_gulden_patent teva and dr._reddys argue that eisais failure to disclose this reference to the patent_office during prosecution of the ¡¬552_patent was material because a reasonable_examiner would have used it to issue a new and stronger prima facie obviousness rejection on the basis of byk_guldens disclosure of asymmetrically-substituted compounds having a methoxyethoxy at the 4-position of the pyridine_ring
but the district_court found byk_guldens teachings cumulative with references already disclosed to the patent_office junggren or junggren combined with beecham
as per 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.56 cumulative evidence is definitionally not material evidence
see monsanto co. v. bayer bioscience n.v. 514_f.3d_1229 1237 fed.cir.2008
here the junggren reference specifically disclosed asymmetrically substituted compounds including a compound having a 4-position methoxyethoxy substituent
thus the byk_gulden reference offered nothing new to the record already before the patent_office
and even tevas expert conceded byk_gulden would not have provided the examiner with anything new
id.at 57
thus the district_court was well within its discretion in concluding that the byk_gulden_patent was not material to the prosecution of the ¡¬552_patent
even if byk_gulden had been material the lack of clear and convincing_evidence of intent to deceive would nonetheless have imposed an insurmountable bar to finding inequitable_conduct for the reasons given by the district_court

as for the fujisaki_declaration eisai submitted it during prosecution to overcome an obviousness rejection
because this reference shows rabeprazoles pharmacological properties the trial_court found it highly material
id.at 59
teva *1362 and dr._reddys argue that the data presented in the fujisaki_declaration were misleading
they contend that the comparison with two non-prior_art compounds without a comparison of the ethyl homolog of rabeprazole shka 661 sent the examiner on a dead-end side trip
the district_court properly characterized this argument as` contorted'
id
the fujisaki_declaration indisputably showed a comparison between rabeprazole and the prior_art compound called out by the examiner demonstrating rabeprazoles superiority
further as discussed above the materiality of shka 661 and the patent_application claiming it was low
the data from the fujisaki_declaration were relevant to prosecution but eisai had no obligation to include additional unnecessary data such as a comparison to shka 661
thus the district_court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that eisai did not commit inequitable_conduct in failing to include additional data in the fujisaki_declaration to the examiner
even here where the submission to the patent_office itself was highly material to prosecution the lack of deceptive_intent rendered stillborn yet another allegation of inequitable_conduct

finally teva and dr._reddys assert that that eisai deceptively declined to inform the examiner of a patent_application for lansoprazole a prior_art proton pump inhibitor and the active_ingredient in prevacid
the district_court disposed of this argument on summary_judgment
the district_court found that teva and dr._reddys had presented neither direct evidence of deceptive_intent nor any evidence to support an inference of materiality
sj_enforceability_order at 58
the strongest evidence of some problem was the passing comment of one eisai` insider' that the similarity of lansoprazole and rabeprazole` bothers me'
id.at 59
but this vague subjective statement is not sufficient by any means to establish materiality let alone intent
moreover given lansoprazoles fluorinated_substituent and its resultant impotence to render the ¡¬552_patent invalid the district_court properly rejected this strained theory of inequitable_conduct on summary_judgment

iv
in a series of thoughtful thorough opinions the district_court carefully explained its reasoning with respect to both obviousness and inequitable_conduct
because the district_court properly concluded that teva and dr._reddys failed to prove that the ¡¬552_patent was invalid for obviousness or unenforceable for inequitable_conduct this court affirms the district_courts judgment

affirmed
