background
a.329_patent
merck owns the329_patent
the329_patent entitled` method for inhibiting bone resorption' teaches a method of treating and preventing osteoporosis through less-than-daily administration of bisphosphonate_compounds
'329_patent col._1,_ll._15-25
the patent was filed on august 14 1998 and merck stipulated at trial that it would not allege an invention date prior to july_22,_1997 for the claims at issue
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 606

bisphosphonates are a family of chemical compounds that are known to selectively inhibit the bone destruction process that contributes to osteoporosis and other bone diseases
'329_patent col._1,_ll._45-50
bisphosphonates include among other compounds alendronate risedronate tiludronate pamidronate ibandronate zolendronate and etidronate
id.at_col._1,_ll._54-65 ; col._2,_ll._28-31
at issue in this case are once-weekly_dosages of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate

bisphosphonates are not readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal` gi' tract
the medications thus require rigorous_dosing_instructions a patient must take the medicine on an empty stomach and remain upright and fasting for thirty minutes after ingestion
'329_patent col._2,_ll._3-24
in addition the compounds are known to have adverse_gi_side_effects that physicians believed to be related in part to a irritation to the patients esophagus or b the size of the dose
id.at col._2,_ll._23-46

before the329_patent issued standard osteoporosis treatments consisted of small daily_doses of bisphosphonates to avoid gi complications
id.at_col._1,_ll._54-61 ; col._2,_ll._34-35 44-46
according to the patent however the adverse_gi_side-effects resulting from repetitive_irritation to the gi tract were the primary concern in the field
id.at col._2,_ll._65-67 ; col._3,_l._57- col._4,_l._13
the inventors trumpeted the reduced-frequency dosing schedule disclosed in the329_patent as decreasing the irritating effect of the compounds as well as increasing patient_compliance with the rigorous_dosing_instructions
id.at col._3,_ll._57-64 ; col._4,_ll._14-23

this case involves dependent claims 23_and_37 of the329_patent
at trial the parties agreed to cast the text of these claims in independent form incorporating all the dependent limitations 23
a method for treating osteoporosis in human_comprising orally administering about 70 mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_basis as a unit_dosage according to a continuous_schedule having a dosing_interval of once-weekly
*1367 37
a method for preventing osteoporosis in human_comprising orally administering about 35 mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_basis as a unit_dosage according to a continuous_schedule having a dosing_interval of once-weekly
'329_patent col._21,_ll._24-27 claim 23 emphasis added ; col._22,_ll._24-26 claim 37 emphasis added
we note that the only differences between claim 23 and claim 37 are 1 the dosage amount of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate 70 mg or 35 mg and 2 whether the method is directed to treating or preventing osteoporosis

merck has food and drug administration` fda' approval to market both a once-weekly and a relatively diminished daily_dose of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate which it does under the trade name fosamax
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 605

b
litigation
in late 2000 teva amended an existing anda and sought fda_approval to market generic versions of mercks once-weekly fosamax supplement in 35 mg and 70 mg quantities.2 merck 288 f.supp.2d at 605-06 ; teva_br.at 4
merck subsequently filed suit against teva under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e 2 a alleging tevas anda filing was an act of infringement.3

according to the trial_court merck acted as its own_lexicographer and through the specification redefined the ordinary_meaning of` about' in claims 23_and_37 -which both parties agree has the ordinary_meaning` approximately' -to something quite different
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 612-16
thus the district_court concluded the terms` about 35 mg' in claim 37 and` about 70 mg' in claim 23 mean exactly 35 or 70 mg of alendronic_acid.4

relying on this construction of` about' the district_court dismissed tevas allegations that the claims at issue were 1 anticipated by a july 1996 lunar_news_article or 2 rendered obvious by an april 1996 lunar_news_article combined with the july 1996 article.5 the trial_court found both articles qualified as prior_art publications under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 a
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 618-19
the *big_token__1368_april_1996__big_token article in lunar_news recommends weekly_dosages of alendronate to improve patient_compliance

[ o ] ne of the difficulties with alendronate is its low oral bioavailability
when taken with water in a fasting state only about 0.8 % of the oral dose is bioavailable
even coffee or juice reduces this by 60 % and a meal reduces it by > 85 %
alendronate must be taken after an overnight fast 30-60 minutes before breakfast
subjects should remain seated or standing ; a very small group of patients have reported some upper gastrointestinal distress if this is not done
this regime may be difficult for the elderly [ to ] maintain chronically
an intermittent treatment program for example once per week or one week every three months with higher oral dosing needs to be tested
update bisphosphonate lunar_news apr
1996 at 31 emphasis added
the july 1996 lunar_news_article further emphasizes the need for a once-weekly_dose of fosamax because` [ s ] ome united states physicians are reluctant to treat [ patients with fosamax ] because of a side effects ; b difficulty of dosing ; and c high costs $ 700/year'
the author suggests the difficulties with oral bisphosphonates may favor their episodic once/week or cyclical one week each month administration
even oral alendronate potentially could be given in a 40_or_80 mg_dose once/week to avoid dosing problems and reduce costs.6

update bisphosphonate lunar_news july 1996 at 23 emphasis added

regarding anticipation the trial_court held the july 1996 article does not` expressly or inherently disclose the dosage amounts for alendronate in claims 23_and_37` because there was no evidence that 40 mg and 80 mg of alendronate contains` the same_number of alendronate core molecules' as found in 35 mg and 70 mg respectively of alendronic_acid
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 618-20

as for obviousness the district_court concluded the suggestion of weekly treatment was not` clinically useful or obvious in july 1997 because of the known dose-related gastrointestinal side effects' associated with the daily_formulation of fosamax
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 628
although it is undisputed that a once-weekly_dosage was known to be efficacious the court determined that the lunar_news_articles could not overcome doctors concerns associated with higher dosages because the lunar_news_articles were not published in peer-reviewed journals or authored by one skilled in the art
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 628-29

finding the329_patent not invalid as anticipated or obvious the district_court delayed the effective date of the fda_approval of tevas anda until the329_patent expires and enjoined commercial sale of tevas generic treatment

b
claim_construction
in finding that merck acted as its own_lexicographer the district_court relied on the following passage from the specification because of the mixed_nomenclature currently in use by those or [ sic ] ordinary_skill in the art reference to a specific_weight or percentage of bisphosphonate_compound in the present_invention is on an active_weight_basis unless otherwise indicated herein
for example the phrase` about 70 mg of bone_resorption inhibiting bisphosphonate selected from the group consisting of alendronate pharmaceutically acceptable_salts thereof and mixtures thereof on an alendronic_acid weight basis' means that the amount of bisphosphonate_compound selected is calculated based on 70 mg of alendronic_acid
'329_patent col._10,_l._65-_col._11,_l._8 emphasis added
according to the district_courts opinion the patentee uses the phrase` about 35 [ or 70 ] mg' to account for variations in the molecular weight of the different derivatives of alendronic_acid and to deliver exactly 35 or 70 mg of alendronic_acid
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 613
for example the court noted that alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate which is used in fosamax requires an atom of sodium for each molecule
id.at 613-14
if a heavier metal were chosen such as potassium the weight of the derivative_compound would have to increase to deliver exactly the same_number of molecules of the active alendronate_compound found in 35 [ or 70 ] mg of alendronic_acid
id.at 614
the district_court thus construed the term` about 35 [ or 70 ] mg' to mean the amount of the derivative_compound that gives exactly 35 [ or 70 ] mg of the active_compound

we reverse the district_courts construction of` about' and hold that such term should be given its ordinary_meaning of` approximately
`` 7 to properly construe *1370 a claim_term a court first considers the intrinsic_evidence starting with the language of the claims
vitronics_corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996
generally claim_terms should be construed consistently with their ordinary and customary meanings as determined by those of ordinary_skill in the art
brookhill-wilk 1 llc v. intuitive surgical inc. 334_f.3d_1294 1298 fed.cir.2003
while in some cases there is a presumption that favors the ordinary_meaning of a term tex
digital sys
v. telegenix inc. 308_f.3d_1193 1202 fed.cir.2002 the court must first examine the specification to determine whether the patentee acted as his own_lexicographer of a term that already has an ordinary_meaning to a person of skill in the art
see e.g. renishaw plc v. marposs societa per azioni 158_f.3d_1243 1250 fed.cir.1998 ; brookhill-wilk 334 f.3d at 1299

when a patentee acts as his own_lexicographer in redefining the meaning of particular claim_terms away from their ordinary_meaning he must clearly express that intent in the written description
see e.g. bell atl
network servs
v. covad communications group inc. 262_f.3d_1258 1268 fed.cir.2001
we have repeatedly emphasized that the statement in the specification must have sufficient clarity to put one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the inventor intended to redefine the claim_term
id
; see also elekta instrument s.a. v. o.u.r
sci
int l inc. 214_f.3d_1302 1307 fed.cir.2000` absent an express intent to impart a novel meaning claim_terms take on their ordinary_meaning
`` ; renishaw 158 f.3d at 1249` the patentees lexicography must of course appearwith reasonable_clarity deliberateness and precision before it can affect the claim'
( quoting in re paulsen 30_f.3d_1475 1480 fed.cir.1994 ; union carbide chems
& plastics tech corp. v. shell oil co. 308_f.3d_1167 1177-78 fed.cir.2002 stating that the` presumption in favor of the claim_terms ordinary_meaning is overcome however if a different meaning is clearly and deliberately set forth in the intrinsic_evidence'
in the present_case the passage cited by the district_court from the specification for mercks definition of` about' is ambiguous
it fails to redefine` about' to mean` exactly' in clear enough terms to justify such a counterintuitive definition of` about'

the phrases ambiguity arises from the fact that it can easily be read as teva *1371 does-as a way of explaining what is meant by the use of the phrase` alendronate_acid_active_basis' rather than as a way of radically redefining what is meant by` about'
the district_court construed the phrase` about 70 [ or 35 ] mg' to mean that one should administer approximately 70 or 35 mg of the derivative_compound such that the end result is that the patient is administered exactly 70 or 35 mg of alendronic_acid
in other_words the district_court determined that the quantity specified in the claims 35_or_70 mg modifies the amount of the derivative_compound rather than the active_compound
under such a construction the term` about' informs one of ordinary_skill in the art to select whatever quantity of the derivative_compound necessary to give exactly 35 or 70 mg of alendronic_acid ; for alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate the word` about' thus meant that 45.68 mg or 91.35 mg of that compound should be delivered-the amount necessary to give exactly 35 or 70 mg of alendronic_acid

unlike the limiting definition of` about' adopted by the district_court tevas interpretation of the paragraph in question would mean that` 70 [ or 35 ] mg' refers to the amount of the active_compound to be administered rather than the amount of the derivative_compound
the term` about' in the claims would then serve to modify the quantity of the active_compound in a way consistent with its normal definition of` approximately'
under this construction the modifying phrase` about 70 [ or 35 ] mg' would refer to approximately 70 or 35 mg of alendronic_acid.8

the claim_construction urged by merck and adopted by the district_court reads the sentence of the passage underlined above out of context
in the sentence before the highlighted sentence the patentee informs those of ordinary_skill in the art that when the patent refers to a certain_amount of a bisphosphonate_compound it is actually instructing them to administer a certain_amount of the active component of the compound rather than the compound itself i.e. that one should calculate the amount dispensed on an` active_weight_basis'
this preceding sentence thus acts to specify a common denominator to be used for all derivatives of alendronic_acid
the underlined_sentence merely gives a specific example-that of an alendronate derivative-to show what is meant by using the phrase` active_weight_basis'

given that the passage that merck relies on is amenable to a second and more reasonable interpretation we hold merck did not clearly set out its own_definition of` about' with` reasonable_clarity deliberateness and precision' and thus failed to act as its own_lexicographer
in re paulsen 30 f.3d at 1480

as further support for this conclusion we note that other_parts of the specification also suggest that` about' should be given its ordinary_meaning of` approximately'
the specification repeatedly describes a range of acceptable dosage amounts with the patentee emphasizing that unit_dosages will vary
for example the specification suggests that a once-weekly_dosage amount could contain anywhere from about 17.5 mg to about 70 mg of any alendronate_compound on an alendronate_acid_active_basis with about 35 mg and about 70 mg being only two examples of a unit_dosage *1372 for once-weekly_dosing an oral unit_dosage comprises from about 17.5 mg to about 70 mg of the alendronate_compound on an alendronic_acid_active_weight_basis
examples of weekly oral dosages include a unit_dosage which is useful for osteoporosis prevention comprising about 35 mg of the alendronate_compound and a unit_dosage which is useful for treating osteoporosis comprising about 70 mg of the alendronate_compound
'329_patent col._12,_ll._56-63 emphasis added
in addition to the above passage at another point in the specification the range for the normal unit_dosage is further widened to` about 8.75 to about 140 mg.'329_patent col._12,_ll._52-55 stating that` a unit_dosage typically comprises from about 8.75 mg to about 140 mg of an alendronate_compound on an alendronic_acid_active_weight_basis'
the specification thus suggests the patentee contemplated a range of dosages further compromising mercks proposition that it acted as its own_lexicographer in defining` about' to mean` exactly
`` 9

finally our construction of` about' eliminates the problem pointed out by teva that the district_courts construction of the term` about' renders other_parts of the claim superfluous
as teva notes the specification uses both the term` about' and` on an alendronic_acid_basis' at least 15 times to describe a dosage strength
if as merck urges` about 35 [ or 70 ] mg' means exactly 35 or 70 mg of alendronic_acid then the oft-repeated phrase` on an alendronic_acid_active_basis' would be unnecessary since such an understanding would be clear simply by using the term` about'
elekta 214 f.3d at 1307 construing claim to avoid rendering the 30 degree_claim_limitation superfluous ; gen._am transp corp. v. cryo-trans inc. 93_f.3d_766 770 fed.cir.1996 rejecting the district_courts claim_construction because it rendered superfluous the claim requirement for openings adjacent to the end walls
elekta 214 f.3d at 1307 construing claim to avoid rendering the 30 degree_claim_limitation superfluous ; gen._am
by construing` about' to mean its accepted and ordinary_meaning of` approximately' the phrase` alendronic_acid_basis' is no longer excess verbiage but is instead necessary because it is the noun that` about 35 [ or 70 ] mg' modifies

because the patentee did not clearly redefine` about' in the specification and because the district_court construed the claim_term in a manner inconsistent with the specification we reverse the district_courts claim_construction
we thus hold that the term` about' should be given its ordinary and accepted meaning of` approximately'

c. invalidity
in light of the corrected claim_construction we find reversible error in the district_courts obviousness analysis
a patent claim is invalid` if the differences between the subject_matter sought to be patented and the prior_art are such that the subject_matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary_skill in the art to which said subject_matter pertains'
35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 2000
the ultimate issue of obviousness turns on four factual_determinations 1 the scope and content of the prior_art 2 the level of ordinary_skill in the art 3 the differences between the claimed invention and the prior_art and 4 *1373 objective_indicia of nonobviousness
graham v. john_deere_co. 383_u.s._1 17-18 86_s.ct._684 15_l.ed.2d_545_(1966)
as explained below we find clear_error in the trial_courts findings on these underlying facts.10 on reviewing these factual bases we conclude the district_court also erred in refusing to invalidate claims 23_and_37 for obviousness in view of the 1996 lunar_news_articles

the central issue concerns the differences between the aspects of the invention claimed at claims 23_and_37 and the teachings of the lunar_news_articles
as the district_court necessarily recognized there are more similarities than differences
these claims and the july 1996 article both teach administering alendronate once a week instead of once a day
these claims read in light of the specification and the july 1996 article both indicate-and it has been conceded as known in the art at the time11-that for treating or preventing osteoporosis a once-weekly_dosage at seven times the daily_dose would be as effective as seven daily_doses
the329_patent and both the april and july 1996 articles explain the motivation for a once-weekly_dose as increasing patient_compliance by making it easier to take the drug and incur the inconvenience of the rigorous dosing regimen less frequently
although the claims teach 70_or_35 mg_doses rather than the 80_or_40 mg_doses disclosed in the july 1996 article dr. arthur c. santora-one of the co-inventors on the329_patent -admitted against mercks interest that a once-weekly 40 mg_dose would be as effective as seven daily 5 mg_doses and a once-weekly 80 mg_dose would be as effective as seven daily 10 mg_doses in preventing or treating osteoporosis
there was no great leap required of those skilled in the art to go from 40_or_80 mg once a week the pills available at the time to treat patients with pagets disease to a 35_or_70 mg pill once a week
the district_courts conclusion that the claims are not obvious can not rest on any of these similarities between the claimed invention and the two lunar_news_articles

the district_court distinguished the two lunar_news_articles on grounds that they failed to explain how the once-weekly_dosing overcame concerns in the art with adverse_gi_side_effects
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 628-29
we are left with the firm_conviction that this distinction is misplaced
as noted the district_court found those in the art had identified two types of adverse gi problems with alendronate
the first and most significant involved esophageal injury or repetitive_irritation of the esophagus
the district_court reviewing the october 1996 article by degroen in the new england journal of medicine expressly recognized the literature taught that complications related to alendronate were due to` prolonged contact of the drug with the esophagus'
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 627
confronted with this problem merck revised its dosing instructions and sent the clarifying materials to prescribing physicians in a march 1996` dear doctor' letter
after merck sent this letter the reported incidence of gi distress fell to almost nothing even as the number of patients being prescribed fosamax doubled by october 1996
although the329_patent focuses on this adverse_gi_side-effect it provides no additional motivation to overcome this problem beyond the motivation described in the two articles
the329_patent both articles and the prevailing knowledge of those skilled *1374 in the art recognized that to the extent` dosing problems' were related to repetitive_irritation of the esophagus from patients getting pills stuck in their throats taking fewer pills each week could reduce the attending gi problems.12 thus the district_court clearly erred in finding any significant difference between the claimed invention and the two articles as to this type of gi problem

the district_court found a second adverse_gi_side-effect related to the size of the dose which merck argued gave rise to` the expectation by physicians in the field during 1996-1997 that alendronate_sodium at doses over 20 mg would not be well-tolerated in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis'
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 624 ; see also id.at 622-23 627-30 discussing chesnut study
neither the329_patent nor the lunar_news_articles explain how a higher once-weekly_dosing regimen would avoid this set of dose-related adverse side effects
the329_patent sets forth no human clinical or laboratory data showing the safety and tolerability of the treatment methods claimed by the patent
the only data provided in the329_patent was generated in beagles an experiment discredited at trial and disregarded by the district_court in its decision
so while the district_court may be correct in finding the lunar_news_articles may have invited skepticism based on concerns for dose-related gi problems the claimed invention adds nothing beyond the teachings of those articles
thus the district_court clearly erred in finding any difference between the claimed invention and the articles on this point

the district_courts only remaining distinction between the claimed invention and the two lunar_news_articles goes to the probative_value of the articles
the trial_court wrote that it` [ was ] not persuaded that the two lunar_news_articles not published in peer-reviewed journals or authored by one skilled in the art either alone or in combination overcame the serious side effect concerns associated with higher dosage units of alendronate_sodium'
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 629
although these indicia of reliability-whether a study is peer-reviewed and the credentials of the author-properly go to weight when the trial_court has not excluded evidence as unreliable and irrelevant the district_courts reliance on these factors to distinguish mercks claimed invention is again misplaced
first as noted above these factors provide no relevant distinction between the articles and the claimed invention because the329_patent also fails to explain how its higher dosing would overcome these dose-related side-effects
second as explained below the district_courts finding the author of the lunar_news_articles not skilled in the relevant_art is inconsistent with the courts own_definition of the relevant_art
thus the extent to which the district_court discounts the probative_value of the two articles based on the credentials of the author calls for closer scrutiny and *1375 casts doubt on the findings that depend on this reasoning

in short the district_court clearly erred in distinguishing the claimed invention from the two lunar_news_articles offered as section 103 prior_art
contrary to the district_courts findings these articles support the conclusion that mercks claims 23_and_37 are invalid as obvious

for similar reasons we find the district_courts characterization of the scope and content of the prior_art favors invalidating claims 23_and_37 as obvious
the district_court described its larger task as identifying` a showing of the teaching or motivation to combine prior_art references'
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 625 quoting in re gartside 203_f.3d_1305 1319 fed.cir.2000
but as shown above in this case the lunar_news_articles contain the relevant teaching of the weekly_dosing claimed in the329_patent
the` specific combination' of elements in claims 23_and_37 differs from the disclosure in the lunar_news_articles only in terms of a minor difference in the dosage ; without this difference the lunar_news_articles would anticipate claims 23_and_37 under section 102
for the lunar_news_articles to render claims 23_and_37 obvious the district_court need only have found a suggestion or motivation to modify the dosages from those in the articles to those in the claims
see e.g. sibia neurosciences inc. v. cadus pharm corp. 225_f.3d_1349 1356 fed.cir.2000
but as noted above mercks own inventors admit the difference in dosing amount is obvious
if anything concern over dosing amount suggests lowering the weekly_dosage-from 80_to_70 mg and from 40_to_35 mg just as merck did
the district_court thus clearly erred to the extent it found lacking any motivation to combine existing knowledge with the lunar_news_articles to reach the claimed invention

the district_court failed to ascertain the required motivation to combine references to achieve the claimed invention and it ignored the plain teachings of the lunar_news_articles
as the court stated` the issue is when viewing the mosaic of prior_art whether those of ordinary_skill in the art would have had the motivation to formulate a once-weekly seven-fold daily_dose of alendronate despite safety_concerns'
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 626

the lunar_news_articles had clearly suggested the once-weekly_dosing
they did so as noted above and as described in the329_patent to avoid or minimize problems related to dosing frequency
and as shown above the district_court itself found this particular set of problems were of greatest concern in the art
indeed to the extent the district_court finds mercks weekly-dosing idea non-obvious because it went against prevailing wisdom the court must still explain why merck and not dr._mazess should get credit for the idea
because mercks idea added nothing to what came before the district_courts answer comes down to nothing more than the credentials of the authors
in this case that difference is not enough to avoid invalidating the claims.13

the district_court answered its own question incorrectly because its analysis of the prior_art fails to credit its own distinction between the` safety_concerns' from dosing frequency and dosing amount
as noted above the claimed invention does not address the problems with the dosing *1376 amount but only the more widespread problems of the dosing frequency
the courts review of the scope and content of the prior_art itself focuses on this concern with` prolonged contact of the drug with the esophagus'
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 627
this understanding of the prior_art does not support a conclusion that the claimed invention as a whole was non-obvious in view of the prior_art
see para-ordnance mfg
v. sgs importers int l inc. 73_f.3d_1085 1087 fed.cir.1995 ; in re kaslow 707_f.2d_1366 1374 fed.cir.1983
insofar as the district_court relied on safety_concerns related to dosing frequency the prior_art favors the conclusion that taking pills once a week was obvious

thus the scope and content of the prior_art confirms that the invention claimed in claims 23_and_37 would have been obvious in view of the lunar_news_articles
to the extent the district_court interpreted the scope of the prior_art otherwise that was clear_error

we likewise find clear_error in the district_courts conclusion that dr._mazess was not skilled in the relevant_art
the district_court failed to credit the evidence showing mazesss lunar_news was widely distributed among those working in the field of osteoporosis
moreover while we recognize the importance academic or professional training plays in establishing expert qualifications or the probative_value of a section 103 reference we think the district_court failed to give proper credit to the fact that dr._mazess was an expert in osteoporosis
in focusing on dr._mazesss academic training the district_court ignored its own finding that one of skill in the art would be someone` working in the field of or doing research on osteoporosis'
thus the district_court erred in dismissing or minimizing the probative_value of the lunar_news_articles

finally the district_court erred in its weighing of secondary considerations of non-obviousness
although the district_court correctly found mercks once-weekly_dosing of fosamax was commercially successful in this context that fact has minimal probative_value on the issue of obviousness
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 629-30
commercial success is relevant because the law presumes an idea would successfully have been brought to market sooner in response to market forces had the idea been obvious to persons skilled in the art
thus the law deems evidence of 1 commercial_success and 2 some causal relation or` nexus' between an invention and commercial_success of a product embodying that invention probative of whether an invention was non-obvious
see graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684` such secondary considerations as commercial_success long felt but unsolved needs failure of others etc. might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject_matter sought to be patented
as indicia of obviousness or nonobviousness these inquiries may have relevancy
`` ; mcneil-ppc inc. v. l. perrigo co. 337_f.3d_1362 1370 fed.cir.2003

that rationale has no force in this case
in graham the supreme court relied on the reasoning from a law review note discussing commercial_success
see graham 383 u.s. at 17-18 86_s.ct._684 citing note subtests of` nonobviousness' a nontechnical approach to patent validity
112 u. pa. l.rev
1169 1175 1964
the article suggested` [ t ] he possibility of market success attendant upon the solution of an existing problem may induce innovators to attempt a solution
if in fact a product attains a high degree of commercial_success there is a basis for inferring that such attempts have been made and have failed'
as our predecessor *1377 court explained in in re fielder 471_f.2d_640 644 c.c.p.a.1973` [ t ] hese rationales presumably approved by the [ supreme ] court tie commercial_success and the like directly to the practical financial source of impetus for research and development'
but that chain of inferences fails on these facts
although commercial_success might generally support a conclusion that mercks claimed invention was non-obvious in relation to what came before in the marketplace the question at bar is narrower
it is whether the claimed invention is non-obvious in relation to the ideas set forth in the lunar_news_articles
financial success is not significantly probative of that question in this case because others were legally barred from commercially testing the lunar_news ideas
dr._mazess for example could not put his ideas to practice in 1996-he could only exhort merck to try it
they did

in this case merck had a right to exclude others from practicing the weekly-dosing of alendronate specified in claims 23_and_37 given 1 another patent covering the administration of alendronate_sodium to treat osteoporosis u.s. pat
no._4621,077 issued nov._4,_1986 ; and 2 its exclusive statutory right in conjunction with fda marketing approvals to offer fosamax at any dosage for the next five years
21 u.s.c.¡± 355 c 3 d ii 2000
because market entry by others was precluded on those bases the inference of non-obviousness of weekly-dosing from evidence of commercial_success is weak
although commercial_success may have probative_value for finding non-obviousness of mercks weekly-dosing regimen in some context it is not enough to show the claims at bar are patentably distinct from the weekly-dosing ideas in the lunar_news_articles
thus we conclude the district_court misjudged this factor as confirming its conclusion of non-obviousness

in short we find the relevant graham factors establish claims 23_and_37 of the329_patent are obvious in view of the april 1996 and july 1996 lunar_news_articles
thus we reverse the district_court and hold claims 23_and_37 invalid

iii
conclusion
we reverse the district_courts claim_construction and hold that` about' should be construed consistently with its ordinary_meaning of` approximately'
in addition we vacate the district_courts determination that the329_patent was not invalid as obvious
we hold claims 23_and_37 invalid as obvious and not infringed
the district_courts judgment of infringement is therefore

reversed

costs
no costs

rader circuit_judge dissenting
this case shows the consequences of paying only lip service to the often-cited but rarely-followed lexicographer_rule and the basic jurisprudential principle of according trial_courts proper deference

elect the lexicographer option at your own risk
with this courts claim_constructions wavering between the plain meaning rule often a subtle way for judges to impose their own semantic subjectivity on claim_terms see e.g. k-2 v. salomon 191_f.3d_1356_(fed.cir.1999)` permanent' affixation of the wheels to the skate boot in the context of in-line skates did not include a bolt that could only be reached by tearing apart the shoe and the` specification uber alles' rule often a way for judges to import limitations not included in the claim see e.g. *1378 phillips v. awh corp. 363_f.3d_1207 1213-14 fed.cir.2004 vacated reh g en banc granted 376_f.3d_1382_(fed.cir._july_21,_2004) a patent applicant might suppose that the best option to define the scope of the claim language might be the lexicographer_rule
under the lexicographer_rule an inventor acts as an independent lexicographer and can even give claim_terms a meaning` inconsistent with its ordinary_meaning'
boehringer ingelheim vetmedica inc. v. schering-plough corp. 320_f.3d_1339 1347 fed.cir.2003 citing teleflex inc. v. ficosa n. am corp. 299_f.3d_1313 1325-26 fed.cir.2002 ; see also teleflex 299 f.3d at 1325` [ a ] n inventor may choose to be his own_lexicographer if he defines the specific terms used to describe the inventionwith reasonable_clarity deliberateness and precision
`` quoting in re paulsen 30_f.3d_1475 1480 fed.cir.1994
indeed this court often acknowledges that an applicant acting as a lexicographer may define` black' as` white'
see hormone research found. inc. v. genentech inc. 904_f.2d_1558 1563 fed.cir.1990` it is a well-established axiom in patent law that a patentee is free to be his or her own_lexicographer and thus may use terms in a manner contrary to or inconsistent with one or more of their ordinary_meanings
`` ; see also e.g. int l rectifier corp. v. ixys corp. 361_f.3d_1363 1373 fed.cir.2004 patentee defining` annular' which ordinarily means in the shape of a ring to describe structures that are not circular or curved but polygonal
in this case the patentee used the lexicographer_rule to define a lengthy phrase
in its definition the patentee defined the phrase with precise values
the patentees definition however fell five letters short of success because the phrase included the word` about'
this court seized on that word gave it an ordinary_meaning and cast aside the lexicographer_rule without a convincing explanation
moreover this court overturned the result of a lengthy district_court trial for the sole reason that the trial_court applied this courts lexicographer_rule
i find it hard to explain to the district_court how it erred by following this courts rules

the disputed term in claim 23 of the329_patent is the phrase` about 70 mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_basis'
similarly the disputed term in claim 37 is the phrase` about 35 mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_basis'
teva contends that this court should parse out one word in that phrase` about' and accord that single_word its ordinary_meaning of` approximately'
merck on the other hand contends that the term` about' is inseparable from the entire_phrase which it defines under the lexicographer_rule to account for the variability in the active ingredient weight that would result from the use of a salt of alendronic_acid

the specification shows the proper interpretation of the disputed phrase
see vitronics_corp. v. conceptronic inc. 90_f.3d_1576 1582 fed.cir.1996` the specification acts as a dictionary when it expressly defines terms used in the claims or when it defines terms by implication`
in the specification of the329_patent the patentee exercised the lexicographer option and defined the disputed phrase as follows because of the mixed_nomenclature currently in use by those o [ f ] ordinary_skill in the art reference to a specific_weight or percentage of a bisphosphonate_compound in the present_invention is on an acid active_weight_basis unless otherwise indicated herein
for example the phrase` about 70 mg of a bone_resorption inhibiting bisphosphonate selected from the group consisting of alendronate pharmaceutically acceptable_salts thereof and mixtures thereof on an alendronic_acid_active_weight_basis' means that the amount of the bisphosphonate *1379 compound selected is calculated based on 70 mg of alendronic_acid
'329_patent col._10,_l._65-_col._11,_l._8

in a passage that classically invokes this courts lexicographer doctrine the patentee clearly deliberately and precisely defined the phrase` about 70 mg of a bone_resorption inhibiting bisphosphonate selected from the group consisting of alendronate pharmaceutically acceptable_salts thereof and mixtures thereof on an alendronic_acid_active_weight_basis'
the patentee set forth that entire term with quotations including the word` about' and then stated unambiguously that the` phrase.. means that the amount of the bisphosphonate_compound selected is calculated based on 70 mg of alendronic_acid'
'329_patent col._11,_ll._2-8 emphases added
the choice of the words` phrase' and` means' combined with the use of quotation_marks to set the phrase off from the rest of the sentence unmistakably notify a reader of the patent that the patentee exercised the option to define the entire_phrase without respect to its ordinary_meaning as understood by one of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention
see multiform desiccants inc. v. medzam ltd. 133_f.3d_1473 1477 fed.cir.1998

to underscore the choice to define the phrase as a lexicographer the patentee explains the reason that this phrase needs definition-' [ b ] ecause of the mixed_nomenclature currently in use by those o [ f ] ordinary_skill in the art'
'329_patent col._10,_ll._65-66
therefore even a casual reader let alone one with skill in this art would immediately recognize that the patentee intended to avoid any ambiguity inherent in` mixed_nomenclature' by explicitly defining the entire_phrase
see paulsen 30 f.3d at 1480`where an inventor chooses to be his own_lexicographer and to give terms uncommon meanings he must set out his uncommon definition in some manner within the patent disclosure so as to give one of ordinary_skill in the art notice of the change'
( quoting intellicall inc. v. phonometrics inc. 952_f.2d_1384 1388 fed.cir.1992

the language of this definition explains further the scientific reason that an express_definition is necessary
alendronate monosodium_trihydrate is a bisphosphonate selected from the group consisting of alendronic_acid pharmaceutically acceptable_salts thereof and mixtures thereof
a salt or a mixture may require a different weight to achieve the same_number of bisphosphonate molecules present in 70 mg of alendronate

the patentee did not leave this difference vague however but instructed that the precise dose in claim 23-' about 70 mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_basis' -means that the amount of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate is calculated based on 70 mg of alendronic_acid
similarly the disputed language of claim 37-' about 35 mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_basis' -means that the amount of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate is calculated based on 35 mg of alendronic_acid
the word` about' in the defined phrase takes into account the variability of the weight of the active ingredient that would result from using different salts of alendronic_acid in the tablets instead of the acid itself
in other_words a heavier salt would require more by weight to achieve the same_number of alendronate molecules
for example about 70 mg of alendronate_sodium on an alendronic_acid_active_basis contains the same_number of molecules of alendronate as 70 mg of alendronic_acid regardless of the actual weight of the alendronate_sodium in the tablet

with respect to the word` about' the patentee included that word in the entire *1380 phrase expressly defined in the specification and set off by quotation_marks
therefore this court can not without disturbing the patentees express_definition of the entire_phrase abstract that term out of its context and supply an ordinary_meaning
thus by abstracting` about' out of the patentees express_definition this courts opinion defeats the patentees choice of words punctuation and phraseology and instead extracts a single_word from its context in the phrase
accordingly the majority rewrites the express_definition either by moving the word` about' outside of the quotation_marks of the defined phrase or by inserting the word` about' into the definitional portion of the sentence so that it would read` the amount of the bisphosphonate_compound is calculated based on about 70 mg of alendronic_acid'
if the patentee had chosen either of those two phraseologies the majority opinion might be correct in its analysis
but because the patentee did not this court can not give any principled reason that the district_court erred in applying the lexicographer_rule
contrary to this courts rules this opinion rewrites the specification and substitutes language not chosen by the patentee
see e.g. chef am. inc. v. lamb weston inc. 358_f.3d_1371 1374 fed.cir.2004 repeating the well-established rule that` courts may not redraft claims'

throughout the patent the applicant remained faithful to the disputed phrases in claims 23_and_37 consistent with the specified lexicography thus completely dispelling any notion of ambiguity in the term` about'
in particular examples 7_and_8 corroborate the express_definition
example 7 states that` [ t ] ablets containing about 35 mg of alendronate on an alendronic_acid_active_basis are prepared using the following weights of ingredients' and lists alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate requiring a mass of 45.68 mg. see329_patent col._19,_ll._14-21
similarly example 8 states that` [ a ] liquid formulation containing about 70 mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_active_basis per about 75 ml of liquid is prepared using the following weights of ingredients' and lists alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate having a mass of 91.35 mg. id.at col._19,_ll._44-52
in these examples the applicant supplied an exact weight that equates with` about 70 mg of alendronate.. on an alendronic_acid_active_basis'
accordingly the district_court did not err in construing` the disputed claim_termsabout 70/35 mg to mean the equivalent of 70/35 mg of alendronic_acid when taking into account_molecular_weight_variances for its derivatives that carry accessories'
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 616
the district_court followed this courts rules

deference to trial courts time for` truth in advertising ?'
this is the classic` close_case' so close in fact that ultimately two federal_judges one of whom conducted an entire bench_trial on this issue and the united states patent and trademark office agreed with merck & co. and two federal_judges agreed with teva pharmaceuticals
the united_states_district_court of delaware tried this case from march 4-7 2003 then issued a 75-page opinion analyzing the claims and arguments in consummate and accurate detail
merck & co. v. teva_pharms
usa inc. 288_f.supp.2d_601 d.del.2003
this court received the typical briefs from the parties an appendix containing selected portions of the record and heard a total of approximately thirty minutes of argument by the parties on the issues before this court
despite the district_courts superior tools and time to evaluate the complete record to hear and inquire from expert and fact witnesses to delve into countless related details to probe the scientific and semantic context and to entertain argument as *1381 long as necessary for clarity this court with its reading three briefs before its half-hour hearing becomes enamored with its own analysis of a very close issue and reverses the district_court

this court often hears criticism from district_court judges that its reversal_rate on claim_construction_issues far exceeds that of other circuit courts
see e.g. symposium the law technology and the future of the federal_circuit a panel discussion claim_construction from the perspective of the district judge 54 case_w._res
l.rev
671 2003 symposium i district judges discussing problems with this courts high reversal_rate on claim_construction_issues ; see gregory j. wallace note toward certainty and uniformity in patent infringement cases after festo and markman a proposal for a specialized patent trial court with a rule of greater deference 77 s. cal
l.rev
1383 1391 2004 discussing various studies regarding this courts reversal_rate on claim_construction_issues
in response nearly every judge on this court has publicly professed to accord some level of deference to district_courts regardless of this courts de novo review of claim_construction_issues
see e.g. symposium i at 680 a district_court judge stating` i have certainly heard a number of federal circuit judges agree that the cafc gives some deference to a well-reasoned opinion as a practical matter' ; symposium the past present and future of the federal_circuit judicial constellations guiding principles as navigational aids 54 case_w._res
l.rev
757 761 2004 judge of the federal_circuit stating` review is really not de novo after all
it is unfortunate that there is no label in between de novo and clear_error review
functionally claim_construction falls in this middle ground`
either the federal_circuit accords deference in accordance with its public protestations or it does not in accordance with its legal standard barring any deference
if the former this court has a` truth in advertising' problem
its actual practice clashes with its professed legal duty
if the latter this court has a different kind of` truth in advertising' problem

in this case this court eschews all deference a particularly striking choice in the face of a very close_case and a district_court whose diligent and intelligent process and resolution earned more respect than it received
i am not entirely sure which aspect of the` truth in advertising' problem this case illustrates but it certainly makes any protestations of deference in fact sound rather hollow

lunar_news is a quarterly newsletter distributed to approximately 15 000_to_20000 physicians and others in the medical art by lunar corporation a manufacturer of bone_densitometry equipment used to diagnose osteoporosis
merck 288 f.supp.2d at 618-19 ; teva_br.at 11-12
the author of each article is dr._mazess who has a doctorate degree in anthropology but does not have formal training in pharmacology
id
teva points out however that dr._mazess directed the bone mineral laboratory at the university of wisconsin established bone_densitometry as a diagnostic tool founded the first manufacturer of bone_densitometry measuring equipment lunar was lunars first president has participated in and designed clinical trials for osteoporosis treatment and is widely published in the bone disease field

teva argues that the 40 mg and 80 mg amounts were recommended because 40 mg tablets of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate were commercially available for those who suffer from pagets disease a bone disorder that also responds to bisphosphonate treatment
the standard_daily_dose of fosamax is 5 mg or 10 mg
exact multiples of the standard_daily_dose corresponding to the amount of fosamax administered in a week i.e. 35 mg or 70 mg were not commercially available at the time of the 1996 lunar_news_articles
thus teva argues the 40 mg and 80 mg_dosages should be viewed as teaching the329_patents seven-fold increase in daily dosages 5_and_10 mg in terms of the 40 mg_doses then-available on the market
7
the dissent frames the dispute in terms of the entire_phrase` about 70 [ 35 ] mg of alendronate_monosodium_trihydrate on an alendronic_acid_basis'
post at 2:22-3:2
notwithstanding this contention the district_court identified the` disputed claim_terms' as` about 70 / 35 mg.' merck 288 f.supp.2d at 616
in its brief to this court merck likewise stated the issue as whether the district_court properly construed the aforementioned limitation not disputed term on grounds that the329_patent expressly defined` about 70 mg' as calculated` based on 70 mg of alendronic_acid'
see appellee br.at 3 statement of issues
we agree with merck and the district_court that the dispute concerns the proper meaning of` about'
we thus understand the dissent to argue that meaning is fixed by the context of the claim and the language of the written description
it is correct to look first to those sources for the meaning at issue
see vitronics 90 f.3d at 1582
however as is noted above when the intrinsic_evidence does not clearly establish its own lexicography it is proper to determine the ordinary_meaning of the term
for that reason we ascribe` about' its ordinary_meaning here
moreover the dissent pursues a philosophical argument as to the deference which should be given to the trial_court
claim construction being a legal matter it is reviewed de novo and this is still the law notwithstanding the desire of some members of this court to consider creating an exception to that rule
see cybor 138 f.3d at 1462-63 plager j. concurring ; id.at 1463-66 mayer c.j. concurring in judgment ; id.at 1473-75 rader j. dissenting
therefore if we apply proper legal precedent as the majority has done in this case the result is clear and obvious

merck argues that the district_courts construction is supported by the fact that` about' was not used twice in the underlined_sentence cited by merck i.e. that the specification does not state that` the amount of bisphosphonate_compound selected is calculated based on about 70 mg of alendronic_acid'
( emphasis added
while mercks grammatical savvy is noted we believe that the omission of a second` about' is likely an inadvertent error rather than the product of meticulous drafting
9
we also note that examples 7_and_8 in the329_patent do not contradict the construction we adopt on appeal because they are only examples of the tablets that could be prepared according to the patent
neither example clearly states that the only embodiment of the claims would be the exact formulations described therein
10
it makes no difference to this conclusion whether the court begins with the claim_construction set forth by the panel or the dissent
in either case the district_court erred in finding the329_patent was not invalid as obvious in view of the lunar_news_articles
11
see merck 288 f.supp.2d at 624

as the329_patent states [ i ] t is found that the administration of a biphosphonate at a high relative dosage at a low relative dosing frequency causes less adverse gastrointestinal effects particularly esophageal effects compared to the administration of a low relative dosage at a high relative dosing frequency
...
such administration methods of the present_invention would be especially beneficial in treating patients that have been identified as suffering from or are susceptible to upper gastrointestinal disorders e.g. gastrointestinal reflux disease i.e
`` gerd' esophagitis dyspepsia i.e
heartburn ulcers and other related disorders
in such patients conventional bisphosphonate therapy could potentially exacerbate or induce such upper gastrointestinal disorders
