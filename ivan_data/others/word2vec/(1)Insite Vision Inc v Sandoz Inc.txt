linn circuit_judge
in this hatch-waxman act litigation sandoz inc.` sandoz' appeals the district_courts decision in insite vision inc. v. sandoz inc. no._11-3080 2013_wl_5975015 d.n.j
oct. 4 2013 which held that sandoz had not shown that the claims of u.s
patents no._6861,411 the` ¡¬411_patent` ; no._6239,113 the` ¡¬113_patent` ; no._6569,443 the` ¡¬443_patent` ; and no._7056,893 the` ¡¬893_patent` collectively` the patents-in-suit' asserted by insite vision inc.` insite' ; inspire pharm. inc.` inspire' ; and pfizer inc.` pfizer' collectively` plaintiffs' are invalid as obvious
this court agrees that sandoz failed to show that the asserted_claims in the patents-in-suit would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art and therefore affirms

background
a
the patents-in-suit
the ¡¬411_patent issued from u.s. patent application no._09 /200,199 the` ¡¬119 application' which was filed on november 25 1998 claiming priority to a provisional application filed on december 2 1997
it is owned by pfizer
insite owns the ¡¬113 ¡¬443 and ¡¬893_patent s the` isv_patents'
the isv_patents claim priority to an application filed on march_31,_1999
inspire is the exclusive sub-licensee of the ¡¬411_patent and the exclusive licensee of the isv_patents

the ¡¬411_patent discloses methods of treating eye_infections by the topical_administration of azithromycin to the eye
¡¬411_patent col.1 ll.8-10
the patent states that prior to the invention azithromycin was commonly administered orally for the treatment of antibacterial infections but was not known to be effective when topically administered to the eye
id.at col.1 ll.22-27
claim 1 of the ¡¬411_patent is representative and recites 1
a method of treating an ocular_infection comprising topically administering to an eye of an animal in need of such treatment an ocular_infection-treating amount of azithromycin

the isv_patents disclose various_formulations and methods of using topical_azithromycin as a gel_eyedrop for treating eye_infections
claim 1 of the ¡¬113_patent ; claim 16 of the ¡¬443_patent ; and claim 1 of the ¡¬ 893 patent are representative and recite 1
a process for treating an eye which comprises topically applying an aqueous polymeric suspension of an azalide_antibiotic wherein said suspension comprises water 0.01 % to 1.0 % of an azalide *857 antibiotic and 0.big_token__1_to_10__big_token % of a polymeric_suspending_agent
¡¬113_patent claim 1 ; 16
a topical_ophthalmic_composition comprising an aqueous polymeric suspension comprising water 0.01 % to 1.0 % of an azalide_antibiotic and 0.big_token__1_to_10__big_token % of a polymeric_suspending_agent wherein said topical_ophthalmic_composition has an osmotic pressure of from 10_to_400 mosm and wherein said composition does not contain constituents that are physiologically or ophthalmically harmful to the eye
¡¬443_patent claim 16 ; 1
a composition comprising water a polymeric_suspending_agent and an azalide_antibiotic wherein said composition has a ph of about 6.big_token__0_to_6__big_token6
¡¬893_patent claim 1

b
history of the dispute
inspire markets a topical_azithromycin solution which is approved by the food and drug administration` fda' and is distributed under the name` azasitethe_r'
the fdas approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations commonly known as the` orange_book' lists all four of the patents-in-suit for azasitethe_r

sandoz filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' for its generic version of azasitethe_r seeking approval prior to the expiration of the patents-in-suit
the anda included a certification pursuant to 21 u.s.c.¡± 355 j 2 a vii iv 2012 commonly referred to as a` paragraph_iv_certification' stating that the claims of the patents-in-suit were invalid and/or not infringed
pursuant to ¡± 355 j 2 b sandoz notified plaintiffs of the paragraph_iv_certification
in response plaintiffs sued sandoz for infringing dependent_claims 3_and_5 of the ¡¬411_patent which depend from claims 1_and_2 ; dependent_claims 6-9 of the ¡¬113_patent which depend from claims 1-3 ; independent_claims 16_and_44 of the ¡¬443_patent ; and dependent_claims 4 6 7 9-12 30 36_and_40 of the ¡¬893_patent which depend directly or indirectly from claims 1_or_23_(collectively,_the_''asserted_claims'') under 35 u.s.c.¡± 271 e

after claim construction sandoz stipulated to infringement but contested the validity of the asserted_claims under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 a 20061 insite 2013_wl_5975015 at *2
before trial sandoz moved to amend the pre-trial order to include as an exhibit the file history of the european counterpart of the ¡¬411_patent the` epo_file_history'
the district_court denied that motion because it concluded that the late proffer was prejudicial
a bench_trial then ensued
the district_court ruled that sandoz had failed to show by clear and convincing_evidence that the asserted_claims would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art and therefore upheld the validity of all of the patents-in-suit
id.at *49
sandoz appeals contending that the district_court` mis-framed' the obviousness_inquiry by adopting plaintiffs characterization of the problem facing a person of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention as the development of` improved topical_treatments for ocular_infections' id.at *20 rather than the narrower problem argued by sandoz of topically administering azithromycin to treat conjunctivitis
sandoz also appeals the district_courts refusal to admit into evidence the late-proffered *858 epo_file_history
we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 u.s.c.¡± 1295 a 1

the ¡¬411_patent
a
the framing of the obviousness question
the district_court began its obviousness_analysis by addressing a dispute between the parties regarding the proper` framing' of the obviousness_question
insite 2013_wl_5975015 at *19
plaintiffs argued that the proper question to be considered by the court was whether it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art at the time of the invention to develop a topical ophthalmic formulation containing azithromycin
sandoz argued for a narrower question whether it would have been obvious that topical_azithromycin could be used to treat conjunctivitis
*859 the district_court agreed with the plaintiffs and found no reason to limit the question to conjunctivitis and to azithromycin
the district_court found that there were options beyond just azithromycin that were available to a formulator when considering topical_ophthalmic_treatments id.at *22 and that persons of ordinary_skill in the art would not have developed formulations that only treated conjunctivitis and not corneal infections given concerns about the spread of conjunctival infections to the cornea
id

on appeal sandoz argues that the district_court erred as a matter of law in its framing of the obviousness_inquiry
sandoz contends that in broadly framing the obviousness_inquiry the district_court required sandoz to prove the obviousness of topical_treatments of all manner of eye_infections and not merely conjunctivitis with azithromycin
sandoz contends that this amounts to an error of law contrary to bedrock legal principles that` [ c ] laims which are broad enough to read on obvious subject_matter are unpatentable even though they also read on nonobvious subject_matter
`` muniauction inc. v. thomson corp. 532_f.3d_1318 1328_n._4_(fed.cir.2008) alteration in original quoting in re lintner 59_ccpa_1004 458_f.2d_1013 1015 1972
sandoz also relies heavily on alcon research ltd. v. apotex inc. in which this court held that courts should` look at any motivation [ for combining references even ] beyond that articulated by the patent'
687_f.3d_1362 1368 fed.cir.2012

plaintiffs respond that identifying the problem faced by a person of skill in the art is a factual question on which the district_court properly ruled
plaintiffs contend that nothing in the district_courts framing of the issue precluded sandoz from proving that topical_treatment of conjunctivitis would have been obvious but that sandoz simply failed to carry its burden-a factual issue not a legal question

the district_court did not clearly err in framing the obviousness_inquiry as it did based on its understanding of the problem facing those skilled in the art at the time the invention was made
moreover the district_court in framing the question did not foreclose sandoz from attempting to prove that the claims would have been obvious based on the treatment of conjunctivitis by the topical_administration of azithromycin

the obviousness_inquiry entails consideration of whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art` would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior_art references to achieve the claimed invention and.. would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in doing so'

*860 whether a person of ordinary_skill in the art would narrow the research focus to lead to the invention depends on the facts
alcon is not to the contrary
alcon merely holds that if the prior_art would motivate a person of skill in the art to make the claimed invention even if that was not based on` the same motivation that the patentee had' the patent would have been obvious
687 f.3d at 1368
but whether the prior_art would so motivate a skilled_artisan is a question of fact
cf
par pharm. inc. v. twi pharm. inc. 773_f.3d_1186 1196 fed.cir.2014`the presence or absence of a motivation to combine references in an obviousness determination is a pure question of fact
`` quoting alza_corp. v. mylan labs. inc. 464_f.3d_1286 1289 fed.cir.2006

here the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the problem faced by one skilled in the art was broader than merely seeking to use azithromycin to treat conjunctivitis
the district_court found that azithromycins characteristics-including that molecules in its class were` known to be bacteriostatic to have a limited spectrum of activity and to require multiple doses per day to penetrate tissue' insite 2013_wl_5975015 at *19-would make it a poor choice for treating ocular_infections
furthermore the district_court found` the unique balance of log p molecular weight solubility and charge' also made it` not a good candidate'
id
the district_court also credited the testimony of plaintiffs expert dr._asbell that desirably effective treatment of conjunctivitis would include penetration of the cornea as well as the conjunctiva because of the potential that a conjunctival infection could spread to the cornea
id.at *7-8
these factual_findings provide sufficient support for the district_courts framing of the relevant question

and the district_courts framing of the question did not prevent sandoz from attempting to invalidate the asserted_claims which were not limited to the cure of conjunctivitis by proving that it would have been obvious to use azithromycin in a topical_treatment to cure that one infection
the problem for sandoz as we will next address is that its proofs simply failed to carry the day in satisfying its clear and convincing_burden

b
the merits of the obviousness determination
sandoz claims that the ¡¬411_patent is an obvious modification of ilotycinthe_r-a topical formulation of erythromycin an active ingredient similar to azithromycin -and zithromaxthe_r an oral azithromycin_formulation used to treat conjunctivitis
sandoz argues that in light of the teachings of the prior_art it would have been obvious to try azithromycin as a topical_treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis with a reasonable_expectation of success
it relies on the testimony of dr._reed that azithromycin was the` newer iteration' of erythromycin with remarkably effective properties and contends that it would have been common sense to substitute a new and improved antibiotic for the antibiotic present in ilotycinthe_r
id.at *14 quoting the trial testimony of dr._reed

sandoz also contends that persons of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to use azithromycin in a topical_treatment given that it was well known according to sandozs expert dr. goren that topical_treatments are generally more effective than oral treatments
it also asserts that while oral use of azithromycin worked through a unique process called phagocytosis that process was not the only process at work in delivering the drug to infected tissue and persons of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been deterred *861 from investigating the topical_administration of azithromycin
finally sandoz relies on proposals for the topical use of azithromycin in the treatment of trachoma allegedly made at a 1997 world health organization meeting that occurred in geneva the` geneva_meeting' and contends that the district_court was wrong to disregard and discount this evidence

plaintiffs counter by arguing that the district_courts factual_findings were well-supported and not clearly erroneous
they argue that the district_court considered all of the potential drug options and correctly concluded that those options would have directed persons of ordinary_skill in the art away from the topical_administration of azithromycin
they also assert that there is no correlation between oral and topical ophthalmic drug penetration
finally they point to sandozs experts contemporaneous failure to use azithromycin topically prior to the ¡¬411 invention as evidence of non-obviousness

the district_court concluded that it would not have been obvious to a person of ordinary_skill in the art to formulate a topical_azithromycin_formulation for ophthalmic treatment of any infection as recited in the asserted_claims of the ¡¬411_patent
the district_court thoroughly and properly considered all of the evidence presented and the various arguments raised by the parties in ruling the asserted_claims to be not invalid
we agree

first the district_court did not clearly err in finding that there were` innumerable' options for ophthalmic treatments including fluoroquinolones
id.at *22
fluoroquinolones` were known to be a better option than azithromycin' because they` were bactericidal [ ] could act on a broad range of bacteria [ and ] were known to penetrate ocular_tissue'
id.at *21 *22
furthermore the district_court did not clearly err in determining that those of skill in the art would have been concerned that azithromycin might not penetrate ocular_tissue based on its high molecular weight charge and insolubility in water
id.at *22
even sandozs expert dr._reed admitted that compounds with high molecular weights and charged compounds might not penetrate ocular_tissue
see id.at *13

the district_court also did not clearly err in crediting dr._asbells testimony that a person of ordinary_skill in the art` would not assume that delivering high concentrations of a drug to the eye topically would ensure that the drug would penetrate the ocular_tissue simply because the drug was successful when administered systemically'
id.at *8
dr._asbells testimony is supported by the fact that oral azithromycin was delivered to the eye at least in part through phagocytosis-a bloodstream dependent process-which would not occur when azithromycin was administered topically
see id.at *11 *21

the district_court did not clearly err in discounting the relevance of ilotycinthe_r given that there was conflicting expert_testimony on whether it had fallen out of favor by 1996
see id.at *9-10
the district_court also did not clearly err in discounting dr._reeds testimony that erythromycin formulations would make azithromycin_formulations obvious given that dr._reeds own 1994 patent for topical_ophthalmic_treatments listed 24 potential antibiotics including erythromycin but did not list azithromycin
see id.at *18

for all of the above reasons this court concludes that sandoz has not met its clear and convincing_burden and therefore affirms the district_courts determination that the asserted_claims of the ¡¬411_patent are not invalid

2
the isv patents
the isv_patents disclose various_formulations and methods of using topical *862 azithromycin as a gel_eyedrop for treating eye_infections
the claims essentially call for azalide azithromycin in a polymeric_suspending_agent for topical ophthalmic use
the district_court concluded that none of the asserted_claims of the isv_patents would have been obvious based on its finding that persons of ordinary_skill in the art would not have been motivated to use the water-based polymeric solutions of the prior_art in an azithromycin_formulation because azithromycin was considered insoluble and unstable in water
see id.at *47
in addition it found that were one to make a topical water-based azithromycin_formulation one of skill in the art would not use polycarbophil a gelling polymer but would instead use a colloidal system
see id
the district_court also found that many of the other limitations present in the claims were separately not obvious
see id.at *48
finally the district_court found that the secondary considerations of unexpected results and long-felt need favored plaintiffs
id.at *49

on appeal sandoz repeats its` framing of the obviousness_question' argument and contends that it would have been obvious to use azithromycin to treat conjunctivitis and to formulate that treatment using durasitethe_r a commercial embodiment of insites u.s. patent no._5192,535 the` ¡¬535_patent` which lists a number of active_ingredients including erythromycin
according to sandoz it would have been obvious to replace erythromycin with azithromycin
it also contends that the ¡¬411_patent itself is prior_art to the isv_patents and that example 5 of the ¡¬411_patent 2 discloses a water-based azithromycin_formulation that renders the asserted_claims obvious

plaintiffs repeat their argument regarding the framing of the obviousness_question and contend that the district properly determined that the isv_patents were not obvious
they argue that the ¡¬535_patent is too general and lacked sufficient data to motivate a person of skill in the art to combine azithromycin with polycarbophil
they further contend that the expert_testimony presented at trial supports the district_courts conclusion that the prior_art taught away from the use of an aqueous polymer with azithromycin as recited in the asserted_claims of the isv_patents
plaintiffs also argue that sandoz failed to show that a person of ordinary_skill in the art would have been motivated to select a polymeric solution from among the number of choices available or would have had a reasonable_expectation of success in making such a selection
finally plaintiffs argue that the district_court correctly held the asserted_claims of the isv_patents are not invalidated by the ¡¬411_patent

we have already addressed the framing of the obviousness_question in connection with our treatment of the ¡¬411_patent supra at 858-60
on the merits we agree with the district_court that sandoz has not clearly and convincingly shown that the asserted_claims of the isv_patents would have been obvious
sandoz relies on the ¡¬535_patent which mentions the possibility that erythromycin could be combined with polycarbophil
the district_court found however that the ¡¬535_patent discloses a` laundry_list of active_ingredients' and credited the testimony of dr. lee that a researcher would focus on the patents examples none of which mention erythromycin
see insite 2013_wl_5975015 at *37
we see no clear_error in the district_courts findings
see ¡¬535_patent col.8 l.64-col.9 l.25 listing numerous potential active_ingredients

*863 sandoz argues that the district_courts treatment of the ¡¬535_patent is inconsistent with merck & co. inc. v. biocraft labs. inc. which held that just because a` patent discloses a multitude of effective combinations does not render any particular formulation less obvious'
874_f.2d_804 807 fed.cir.1989
sandoz overreads merck
in merck one reference expressly taught the combination of the compounds claimed in the patent
id
here by contrast selecting from the laundry_list of potential active_ingredients listed in the ¡¬535_patent at best teaches that polycarbophil can be combined with erythromycin
the ¡¬535_patent does not mention azithromycin
thus the skilled_artisan would still need to modify that combination by changing erythromycin to azithromycin
moreover as noted above those of skill in the art would have been concerned about azithromycins solubility and stability in water so the modification from erythromycin to azithromycin would be even less obvious

as for the admissibility of the ¡¬411_patent as a reference against the isv_patents we note that the ¡¬119 application which issued as the ¡¬411_patent was filed in 1998 before the earliest priority date of the isv_patents
the ¡¬ 411 patent is assigned to pfizer while the isv_patents are assigned to insite
the patents are not commonly owned or subject to a duty to assign to a common owner
accordingly the ¡¬411_patent qualifies as prior_art to the isv_patents under 35 u.s.c.¡±¡± 102 e and 103 c 2006
the significance of the fact that these patents are not commonly owned despite their being licensed to inspire and listed in the orange_book may not have been fully appreciated by sandozs expert dr._reed who said he was not basing his opinions on any post-1996 references
insite 2013_wl_5975015 at *24
be that as it may the district_courts ruling that dr._reed was precluded from relying on the ¡¬411_patent should not preclude sandoz from relying on the ¡¬ 411 patent itself as a reference as it was listed by sandoz in its pre-trial submission
and the district_court anticipating the possibility of appeal took the precaution of analyzing whether the isv_patents were obvious over the ¡¬411_patent
id
it found that even in light of the ¡¬411_patent the claims of the isv_patents were not obvious
id.at *46
we agree
the district_court found the water-based examples of the ¡¬411_patent to fall far short of satisfying sandozs burden and found persuasive the testimony of drs
lee and ahmed that the examples disclosing azithromycin and water-based polymers raised concerns as to stability
the district_court also found persuasive the testimony of drs
reed and lee that there were significant differences between carbopol disclosed in the ¡¬411_patent and the polycarbophil of the isv_patents
we find no clear_error in the district_courts fact-finding or the legal conclusion it drew therefrom on the obviousness_question

finally we can not say that the district_court clearly erred in finding that there were meaningful secondary considerations
the district_court found that a 60-fold_increase in the concentration of azithromycin when dosed topically as opposed to orally was unexpected and also found that azasitethe_r met a long-felt need
insite 2013_wl_5975015 at *49 *50
sandoz argues that some increase in concentration was to be expected
see appellants br.at 50
even if true sandoz has not shown that a 60-fold_increase was expected
sandoz also offers nothing to rebut the district_courts finding that azasitethe_r met a long-felt need

in sum we find that sandoz has failed to clearly and convincingly show that the claims of the isv_patents would have been obvious

*864 3
the exclusion of the epo file history
sandoz sought to introduce into evidence the epo_file_history which allegedly chronicled some of the discussions held at the geneva_meeting
sandoz did not list this document in its original exhibit_list
it only sought to amend the exhibit_list after the pretrial conference and after briefing and supplemental briefing on the various motions in limine were complete

in an oral order the district_court refused to allow sandoz to introduce the epo_file_history into evidence
the district_court based its decision on several grounds remarking that sandozs attempt to introduce the evidence was` an eleventh hour proffer' ; that it would take plaintiffs` quite a bit of preparation' to deal with these documents ; that it was` told' but did not know that european patent law would regard oral presentations and accompanying documentation even if not widely available as prior_art ; and that the file contained attorney arguments and not factual statements
the district_court acknowledged that as parties to the original proceedings plaintiffs were aware of these documents and that` [ s ] ome courts might consider th [ e ] [ european proceedings ] to be pretty powerful evidence'

sandoz argues that the district_court abused its discretion in precluding it from amending the exhibit_list
according to sandoz the epo_file_history contains factual admissions about the date and content of the geneva_meeting relevant to its obviousness case
sandoz further contends that there was no finding of bad_faith or improper tactics in the filing of its motion to amend and that the prejudice to plaintiffs of allowing this evidence would have been minimal
plaintiffs counter that the district_courts basis for excluding this document was sufficient and did not amount to an abuse of discretion

federal rule of civil procedure 16 e states that a` court may modify the order issued after a final pretrial conference only to prevent manifest injustice'
the third_circuit considers five pennypack factors in determining whether a district_court abused its discretion in excluding evidence 1` the prejudice or surprise in fact of the party against whom the excluded witnesses would have testified' or the excluded evidence would have been offered ; 2` the ability of that party to cure the prejudice' ; 3 the extent to which allowing such witnesses or evidence would` disrupt the orderly and efficient trial of the case or of other cases in the court' ; 4 any` bad_faith or willfulness in failing to comply with the courts order' ; and 5 the importance of the excluded evidence

`` the importance of the evidence is often the most significant factor'
id
( citing sowell v. butcher & singer inc. 926_f.2d_289 302 3d cir.1991 and pennypack 559 f.2d at 904
a decision to exclude testimony should be disturbed only if there is` a definite and firm_conviction that the court below committed a clear_error of judgment
`` id.at 293 quoting in re tmi litig. 193_f.3d_613 666 3d cir.1999

here we do not have such a definite and firm_conviction for several reasons
we agree with the district_courts assessment of the relevant pennypack factors as being either neutral or favoring plaintiffs
the district_court had ample basis to find prejudice to the plaintiffs as plaintiffs on the eve of trial would have had to prepare arguments explaining the differences between european and united *865 states patent law and the significance of the statements in the prior proceedings
there is also no indication of how plaintiffs would have been able to cure that prejudice
thus the first two factors favor plaintiffs

the third factor disruption of trial is neutral at best
likewise the fourth factor bad_faith is neutral given the fact that the district_court made no finding either way on the question of bad_faith
`` making no finding on the question of bad_faith which is what the district_court did is quite different from finding that there was no bad_faith'
konstantopoulos v. westvaco corp. 112_f.3d_710 720_n._7_(3d_cir.1997)
as for the fifth factor relating to the importance of the excluded evidence the district_court was correct to at least question the relevance and probative value of the epo_file_history under united states law
the situation here is thus notably different from the facts of zf_meritor where the exclusion of testimony` clear [ ly ]' foreclosed plaintiffs suit despite the fact that they had won at the liability stage
696 f.3d at 299
this factor like the others does not favor sandoz

in view of the totality of evidence we do not have a definite and firm_conviction that the district_court abused its discretion and have no reason to disturb the district_courts decision to exclude the epo_file_history

iii
conclusion
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district_courts determination that the asserted_claims have not been shown to be invalid

affirmed
