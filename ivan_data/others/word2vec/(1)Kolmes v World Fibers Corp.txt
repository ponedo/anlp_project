synopsis
patentee brought action against alleged_infringer of patent for cut-resistant_yarn used in making cut-resistant_gloves
the united_states_district_court for the middle_district of north_carolina william l. osteen sr. j. found that patent was not invalid that patent was not obtained by means of inequitable_conduct and that patent was infringed and awarded damages based upon reasonable_royalty
alleged infringer appealed
the court of appeals lourie circuit_judge held that 1 patent specification contained sufficient written description of claimed wrapping_rate for yarns two strand_core ; 2 distribution of gloves before critical_date was for experimental_purposes and patent was thus not invalid under statutory on-sale_bar ; 3 patent was not invalid as obvious ; 4 patentee did not engage in inequitable_conduct ; 5 documents offered by alleged_infringer did not satisfy business_records_exception to hearsay rule ; 6 alleged_infringer was not entitled to damages or attorney_fees ; and 7 patentee was not entitled to damages for frivolous_appeal

affirmed

opinion
lourie circuit_judge
world fibers corporation appeals from the judgment of the united_states_district_court for the middle_district of north_carolina holding that u.s._patent 5,177,948 is not invalid and that it was not obtained by means of inequitable_conduct
it also appeals from the courts ruling denying entry into evidence of documents that it offered in an attempt to prove invalidity
kolmes v. world elastic corp. no._493cv00719 m.d.n.c
sept._18,_1995
world does not appeal the courts added finding of infringement
because the district_court did not err in its holding concerning validity and did not abuse its discretion on the issue of inequitable_conduct and in its evidentiary ruling we affirm

background
the948_patent concerns a cut-resistant_yarn for use in making inter alia cut-resistant_gloves
the prior_art cut-resistant_yarns typically used wire which was undesirable because it restricted movement and was readily breakable
the948 invention improved upon this material by using non-metallic components
figure 1 of the patent reproduced below illustrates an embodiment of the yarn of the patent 10
it includes two core_strands 12 14 and two covering strands 16 18 wrapped around the core_strands in opposite_directions relative to each other
one of the core_strands comprises fiberglass
the other core strand and the covering strands typically comprise nylon extended chain polyethylene aramid or polyester

?
-- -- - claim 1 reads as follows
1
a non-metallic composite cut-resistant_yarn for use in making strong_flexible_cut-resistant_products comprising a a non-metallic core including at least one strand of fiberglass said at least one strand having a denier in the range of 375-1,000 and being substantially parallel to *1538 and untwisted with another strand in said core ; b a non-metallic covering wrapped on said core said covering including at least tow [ sic two ] strands unbraided and spirally wrapped in opposite_directions relative to each other around the core said composite cut-resistant_yarn having a composite denier between about 2,000 and about 5,000 ; c said two strands in said covering being spirally wrapped about said core at the rate of 8-12 turns per inch ; whereby said composite yarn may be formed into fabric on conventional knitting or weaving machines

nathaniel h. kolmes and harold_f._plemmons collectively` kolmes' filed their first application for patent relating to this subject_matter on june_13,_1989
they filed a continuation-in-part application on march_2,_1990 and a continuation_application on january 15 1992
this latter application filed under 37 c.f.r.¡± 1.62 and using the same specification as the 1990 application properly claimed the benefit of the filing_date of the 1990 application under 35 u.s.c.¡± 120
it was accompanied by additional_claims which became part of the granted patent
it eventually became the948_patent
in denying kolmes motion for a preliminary injunction the district_court found that the continuation_application and hence the948_patent was not entitled to the benefit of the filing_date of the 1989 application and that finding has not been challenged on appeal
thus the additional_claims of the patent have an effective filing_date of march_2,_1990 and a critical_date of march_2,_1989 for purposes of 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 b if they are adequately described in the specification

before the critical_date sample_gloves made from the new yarn were sent to certain of kolmes customers for testing
in particular the district_court found that these activities were documented by six` sales' records two dated september 11 1988 and four dated february 21 1989
a typical use of the yarn was in making cut-resistant_gloves for use in meat-packing plants and kolmes thus sent the gloves out for testing in order to see whether they would work in that environment and withstand repeated laundering

kolmes sued world for infringement
the district_court conducted a bench_trial concluding that the948_patent was not invalid
it found that the 1990 application adequately supported the claims added in the 1992 continuation_application
with respect to the on-sale and public_use_bars the court found that gloves distributed before the critical_date were marked` sample' and were sent with a` sample_sheet' free of charge
they were in experimental_use and thus did not create a statutory bar

the court also found that the patent was not invalid on the ground of obviousness over u.s._patent 5,119,512` the dunbar_patent' and u.s._patent 4,886,691` the wincklhofer_patent' which it found to be most pertinent
the wincklhofer_patent discloses the use of wire in yarn which the court found was different from the claimed non-metallic yarn of the948_patent
the court found that the inventors proved they made their invention before the filing_date of the dunbar_patent thereby removing it as prior_art
the district_court found that no inequitable_conduct occurred in the failure of the patentees to submit to the patent and trademark office` pto' the wincklhofer_patent the dunbar_patent and evidence of pre-critical_date sales activity
finally the district_court found that world infringed the948_patent and awarded damages based upon a reasonable_royalty of ten percent
world now appeals certain of these conclusions to this court

discussion
on appeal from a bench_trial we review a district_courts decision for errors of law and clearly erroneous_findings of fact
fed.r.civ.p
52 a ; see interspiro usa inc. v. figgie int l inc. 18_f.3d_927 930 30_uspq2d_1070 1072 fed.cir.1994

a
new matter
world argues with respect to claim 1 that the 1990 application failed to disclose the *1539 desirability of using a wrapping_rate of 8-12 turns per inch with a two strand_core rather than with a one strand_core
it asserts that this subject_matter was new_matter because according to world it was first added with the new claims when the 1992 continuation_application was filed
world argues that the inventors were therefore not entitled to the 1990 filing_date and the claims were therefore barred by a public_use
kolmes responds that the newly added claims did not constitute new_matter and were entitled to that filing_date precluding a public_use_bar

the patent statute requires that the` specification shall contain a written description of the invention'
35 u.s.c.¡± 112 ?
1 1994
section 132 requires that no new_matter be added to the disclosure of an application
35 u.s.c.¡± 132 1994
the question raised here is whether the claims added by the preliminary amendment to the 1992 continuation_application find adequate support in the 1990 application sufficient to meet the description_requirement of section 112 ?
1
see in re winkhaus 527_f.2d_637 640 188_uspq_129 131 ccpa 1975` claims added by amendment and drawn to an invention not so described in the specification are drawn tonew_matter and prohibited by ¡± 132
``

whether a patent satisfies the description_requirement of section 112 ?
1 is a question of fact which we review for clear_error on appeal from a bench_trial
ralston purina co. v. far-mar-co inc. 772_f.2d_1570 1575 227_uspq_177 179 fed.cir.1985
we agree with kolmes that the specification contains a written description of the invention of claim 1
with respect to claimed element a the specification discloses a core having two parallel untwisted strands in figure 1 and at col. 3 lines 9-20
it discloses a denier in the range of 375_to_1000 for the core at col. 5 lines 48-49
with respect to element b the specification discloses the spirally-wrapped two strand covering in figure 1 and at col. 3 lines 21-27 and it discloses the claimed denier range at col. 5 lines 63-65
the specification discloses several non-metallic materials for the core and covering strands at col. 3 lines 15-big_token__20_and_23__big_token -27

element c requires that the covering be wrapped at a rate of 8-12 turns per inch
at col. 5 lines 38-40 the specification states that the coverings or wrappings are formed` at the rate of 4-12 turns per inch with 8 turns per inch being preferred'
all the claimed limitations including the 8-12 turns per inch are thus well supported by the specification
although the text of the specification only discusses the claimed wrapping_rate with reference to a figure showing a one strand_core the specification discloses a two strand_core with a two strand covering
world has not shown that the specification as a whole would have failed to convey to one skilled in the art the use of the claimed wrapping_rate with a two strand_core
see in re alton 76_f.3d_1168 1172 37_uspq2d_1578 1581 fed.cir.1996 stating that in order to satisfy the written description_requirement an applicant must convey as of the filing_date that he or she was in possession of the invention
claims to subject_matter disclosed in the specification are not new_matter
accordingly the district_court did not clearly err in finding that the claims were supported by the 1990 application thus satisfying the description_requirement of section 112 ?
1

b
the on-sale and public use bars
world argues that samples of gloves made from the claimed yarn were given away and sold before the critical_date in violation of the public_use and on-sale_bars
it insists that the samples were not in experimental_use because they were not covered by confidentiality agreements and no progress reports were kept concerning the performance of the gloves in the alleged tests
kolmes responds that the district_court properly found that the gloves in question were given away for experimental_purposes
it argues that its initial tests were not satisfactory because the glass fibers being used broke and caused irritation and that accordingly further outside testing was required to ensure that the *1540 gloves could withstand normal use in a meat-packing plant
it argues that the testing satisfied the criteria for experimental_use ; in particular it asserts that the gloves were provided to customers in relatively small numbers to iowa beef and other customers under conditions of confidentiality and that reports were requested from them

application of the on-sale_bar under section 102 is a question of law based upon underlying issues of fact
see keystone retaining wall sys. inc. v. westrock inc. 997_f.2d_1444 1451 27_uspq2d_1297 1303 fed.cir.1993
`` whether or not an invention was on-sale or in public_use within the meaning of section 102 b is a question of law that this court reviews de novo ; however factual findings underlying the trial courts conclusion are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review'
manville sales corp. v. paramount sys. inc. 917_f.2d_544 549 16_uspq2d_1587 1591 fed.cir.1990
a determination that an invention was on sale within the meaning of section 102 b requires that` the claimed invention asserted to be on sale was operable the complete invention claimed was embodied in or obvious in view of the device offered for sale and the sale or offer was primarily for profit rather than for experimental_purposes'
keystone 997 f.2d at 1451 27 uspq2d at 1303
in umc we stated that` [ a ] ll of the circumstances surrounding the sale or offer to sell including the stage of development of the invention and the nature of the invention must be considered and weighed'
umc elecs co. v. united_states 816_f.2d_647 656 2_uspq2d_1465 1471-72 fed.cir.1987

we agree with kolmes that the relevant factual findings by the district_court are not clearly erroneous and that they support a conclusion that the sample_gloves distributed before the critical_date were in experimental_use
an inherent feature of kolmes invention was durability the ability to withstand use in an environment such as a meat-packing plant with repeated laundering
that feature is evident from the preamble of claim 1 which states that the yarn is` for use in making strong_flexible_cut-resistant_products'
testing was hence required in such an environment in order to ensure that the invention would work for its intended_purpose
see manville 917 f.2d at 550 16 uspq2d at 1592 stating that the invention an iris arm device for a light pole used at rest stops was` specifically designed to withstand year around weather' and that accordingly` prior to its testing in the winter environment there really was no basis for confidence by the inventor that the invention would perform as intended and hence no proven invention to disclose
`` ; gould inc. v. united_states 217_ct.cl._167 579_f.2d_571 583 198_uspq_156 167 1978 stating that experimental_use includes` tests needed to convince [ the inventor ] that the invention is capable of performing its intended_purpose in its intended environment'

furthermore the district_court found a lack of commercialization in the limited distribution of the gloves stating that` [ o ] nly a few gloves were sent ; the gloves were markedsample ; sent with a sample_sheet and free of charge'
the court noted that six weber sales inquiry records documented the experimental program stating that` five records are marked sample and each record details a variation of a spectrathe_r/fiber glass yarn
each record documents a different product and the variations indicate that the yarn was in an experimental stage'
the samples were also subjected to destructive testing which is evidence that the testing was experimental
world has not shown that these fact findings are clearly erroneous
the variations in the yarn composition coupled with the other facts make clear that the patentees were experimenting with the yarn ; they were attempting to determine if the yarn sufficed to make strong flexible cut-resistant_products like gloves and to determine the effectiveness of the variations in the yarn
accordingly the district_court did not err in holding that the948_patent was not invalid on the ground of the on-sale_bar

world conceded at the hearing that its public_use argument assumed that kolmes was not entitled to the benefit of the 1990 *1541 filing_date
because as explained above we conclude that kolmes was entitled to the benefit of that filing_date we need not address worlds argument concerning public_use
accordingly the district_court did not err in holding that the948_patent was not invalid on the ground of the public_use_bar

c. obviousness
world argues that the invention would have been obvious at the time it was made based upon the disclosure of the dunbar_patent
in particular it argues that the dunbar_patent discloses the invention except for the limitation that the covering strands be wrapped at a rate of 8-12 turns per inch which is a matter of routine design choice
kolmes responds that the dunbar_patent is not effective prior_art and even if it were it fails to suggest adjusting the turns to 8-12 per inch

a determination of obviousness under 35 u.s.c.¡± 103 is a legal conclusion involving factual inquiries
uniroyal inc. v. rudkin-wiley corp. 837_f.2d_1044 1050 5_uspq2d_1434 1438 fed.cir.1988
the ultimate conclusion concerning obviousness as a question of law is reviewed de novo ; the findings concerning the underlying factual inquiries are reviewed for clear_error on appeal from a bench_trial
see id
we agree with kolmes that the district_court did not err in determining that the dunbar_patent is not prior_art to kolmes invention
as noted by the district_court the pto determined during a reexamination of the948_patent that kolmes had invented the patented yarn prior to the filing_date of the dunbar_patent
world has shown no error in this conclusion

world also argues that a prior patent of the same inventors u.s._patent 4,777,789 disclosed a rate of 2-24 turns per inch which encompasses the claimed range
world apparently argues that one skilled in the art would have known to modify that disclosed wrapping_rate to that claimed in the948_patent
kolmes responds that world showed that there was no motivation to modify the invention disclosed in the789_patent
we agree
the789_patent discloses the use of wire in addition to non-metallic fibers and world has shown no suggestion or motivation to modify the teaching of the789_patent with regard to non-metallic fibers
hence it failed to prove that the invention would have been obvious in light of the789_patent
see acs hosp sys. inc. v. montefiore hosp. 732_f.2d_1572 1577 221_uspq_929 933 fed.cir.1984` obviousness can not be established by combining the teachings of the prior_art to produce the claimed invention absent some teaching or suggestion supporting the combination`
accordingly the district_court did not err in holding that the948_patent is not invalid on the ground of obviousness

d. inequitable conduct
world argues that the inventors intentionally withheld material prior_art in particular the dunbar_patent evidence of alleged prior_invention by employees of allied-signal and evidence of kolmes pre-critical_date sales activity
kolmes responds that there was no showing of an intent to deceive the pto or of materiality of the evidence in question

a determination of inequitable_conduct is committed to a district_courts discretion
accordingly we review the courts judgment for an abuse of discretion
kingsdown med consultants ltd. v. hollister inc. 863_f.2d_867 876 9_uspq2d_1384 1392 fed.cir.1988
to overturn a discretionary ruling of a district_court` the appellant must establish that the ruling is based on clearly erroneous_findings of fact or on a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or evidences a clear_error of judgment on the part of the district_court'
molins plc v. textron inc. 48_f.3d_1172 1178 33_uspq2d_1823 1827 fed.cir.1995

inequitable conduct consists of an` affirmative misrepresentation of a material fact failure to disclose material information or submission of false material information coupled with an intent to deceive'
*1542 id. 48_f.3d_1172 33 uspq2d at 1826
one alleging inequitable_conduct must prove the threshold elements of materiality and intent by clear and convincing evidence
id. 48_f.3d_1172 33 uspq2d at 1826-27
the district_court must then weigh any threshold findings of materiality and intent in light of all the circumstances to determine whether they warrant a conclusion that inequitable_conduct occurred
id

we agree with kolmes that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in finding a lack of inequitable_conduct
specifically there was no evidence of an intent to deceive the pto
with respect to the dunbar_patent the evidence showed that plemmons office received a copy of that patent approximately one month before the948_patent issued
however there was no evidence that he personally saw it or had personal knowledge of it
this lack of evidence is inconsistent with an intent to mislead the pto
the district_court also found that there was no evidence of an intent to deceive the pto through the failure to disclose information concerning the alleged` sales' activities in question and that kolmes had a good faith belief that his patent was valid
likewise with respect to the information concerning alleged prior_invention by others there is no evidence of an intent to deceive the pto
we do not find clear_error in any of these findings
accordingly the district_court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the948_patent was not obtained by means of inequitable_conduct

e. evidentiary ruling
world argues that it was entitled to have introduced into evidence internal invention disclosure documents of allied-signal inc. which it alleges would invalidate the948_patent on the ground of prior_invention under 35 u.s.c.¡± 102 g
it argues that kolmes would not have been prejudiced by the alleged surprise production of the documents only a few days before trial because with reasonable diligence he should have discovered the documents himself
kolmes responds that the allied-signal_documents were properly excluded ; they were hearsay and were not within the business_records_exception to the hearsay exclusion

we review evidentiary rulings under an abuse of discretion standard
kearns v. chrysler corp. 32_f.3d_1541 1547 31_uspq2d_1746 1750 fed.cir.1994 cert
denied 514_u.s._1032 115_s.ct._1392 131_l.ed.2d_244_(1995)
in order for world to obtain a new trial it must show an abuse of discretion by the district_court in excluding the challenged evidence and that such ruling prejudiced its substantial rights and was thus not harmless error
see 28 u.s.c.¡± 2111 1994 ; kearns 32 f.3d at 1547 31 uspq2d at 1750 ; dmi inc. v. deere & co. 802_f.2d_421 428 231_uspq_276 280-81 fed.cir.1986

we agree with kolmes that the district_court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the documents
the district_court found that the documents were hearsay and not properly authenticated to be admitted under the business_records_exception
see fed.r.evid
802 803 6 allowing the admission of records of regularly conducted activity through the testimony of a custodian or other_qualified_witness
they were authenticated only by affidavit and the court found that kolmes had no opportunity to cross-examine the affiant
without the opportunity for cross-examination kolmes was unable to fully challenge the admissibility of the documents by attempting to show that the requirements of the business_records_exception had not been met

world also attempted to authenticate the documents by the testimony of paul weber who was previously a consultant for allied-signal and it argues that the documents were admissible through his testimony
kolmes responds that weber was not a` custodian or other_qualified_witness' because he did not know when or how the documents were prepared
we agree with kolmes that world failed to establish that weber was a custodian or other qualified *1543 witness under the business_records_exception
weber testified that he had seen the documents while attending a meeting at allied-signal however he failed to testify concerning the record-keeping process related to them a requirement for admissibility of documents under the business_records_exception
see fed.r.evid
803 6
thus world failed to establish that weber was a custodian or other_qualified_witness see id. and the district_court thus did not abuse its discretion in excluding the documents

f. attorney fees and frivolous appeal
world requests damages under 35 u.s.c.¡± 284 as compensation for what it alleges are fraudulent acts of kolmes
however section 284 authorizes a court to award damages for infringement of a patent ; world is the accused infringer and has not in this case prevailed in an infringement claim
accordingly world is not entitled to damages under section 284
world also requests an award of attorney_fees under 35 u.s.c.¡± 285` the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney_fees to the prevailing party`
because world is not the prevailing party it is not entitled to attorney_fees

kolmes requests an award of damages under fed
r.app
p. 38 arguing that worlds appeal is baseless
rule 38 authorizes a court of appeals to award damages for a frivolous_appeal and we have held that appeals may be frivolous as filed or as argued
state_indus. inc. v. mor-flo indus. inc. 948_f.2d_1573 1578 20_uspq2d_1738 1742 fed.cir.1991
an appeal is frivolous as filed if` no basis for reversal in law or fact can be or is even arguably shown'
connell v. sears roebuck & co. 722_f.2d_1542 1554 220_uspq_193 203 fed.cir.1983
kolmes request first fails for lack of a separate motion
see fed
r.app
p. 38
on the merits although world had many hurdles to overcome in its attempt to obtain a reversal its appeal was not baseless and therefore was not frivolous as filed
kolmes also argues that worlds brief is misleading
we have carefully considered worlds briefs and conclude that they do not evidence any sanctionable conduct
see state_indus. 948 f.2d at 1579_n._4 20 uspq2d at 1743_n._4_(listing_examples_of_sanctionable_conduct)
because we conclude that worlds appeal was not frivolous as filed or as argued even considering its unfounded claims for attorney_fees or damages under sections 284_and_285 kolmes is not entitled to damages under rule 38

we have considered the parties other arguments and conclude that they are either unpersuasive or unnecessary for resolution of this appeal

conclusion
the district_court did not err in holding that the948_patent is not invalid
it did not abuse its discretion in holding that the patent was not obtained by means of inequitable_conduct and in denying entry into evidence of the allied-signal_documents
world is not entitled to damages under section 284 or attorney_fees under section 285
because worlds appeal was not frivolous kolmes is not entitled to damages under fed
