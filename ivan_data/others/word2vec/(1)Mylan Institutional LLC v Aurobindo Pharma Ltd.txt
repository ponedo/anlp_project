feb. 7 2017` order adopting r & r'
because the district_court did not err in its grant of the preliminary_injunction under the050_patent although it did err in granting the injunction under the992 and616_patent s we affirm

background
apicore owns and mylan_inst
is the exclusive_licensee of the992616 and050_patent s which relate to isb a triarylmethane dye used to map lymph nodes
the992 and616_patent s together` the process_patents' are directed to a process for preparing isb by reacting isoleuco_acid with silver_oxide in a polar_solvent followed by reaction with a sodium_solution
see e.g.992_patent col. 7_ll._21 -44.1 the992_patent further requires 2.0-3.0 equivalents of silver_oxide
see id
col. 9_l._65
claim 1 of the616_patent is representative of the process_patents and reads as follows a process of preparing n- [ 4- [ [ 4- diethyl-amino phenyl ] 2,5-disulfophenyl methylene ] -2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene ] -n-ethylethanaminium sodium_salt comprising combining a suspension of isoleuco_acid of the formula

?
in a polar_solvent with silver_oxide recovering isosulfan_blue_acid and treating the isosulfan_blue_acid with a sodium_solution
'616_patent col. 9_ll._38 -64 emphasis added
claim 1 of the992_patent adds the limitation that 2.0-3.0 equivalents of silver_oxide are employed in the process but otherwise resembles the claim shown above
see992_patent col. 9_ll._41 -67
the050_patent which the parties refer to as` the purity_patent' is directed to an isb_compound having a purity greater than 99.0 % as measured by high_performance_liquid_chromatography` hplc'
see050_patent col. 9_ll._54 -58
claim 1 is illustrative and reads as follows a compound n- [ 4- [ [ 4- diethylamino phenyl ] 2,5-disulfophenyl methylene ] -2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene ] -n-ethylethanaminium sodium_salt having a purity of at least 99.0 % by hplc

around 1981 hirsch industries` hirsch' developed a 1 % injectable solution of isb which it commercialized under the trade name lymphazurinthe_r
covidien ltd.` covidien' the successor-in-interest to hirsch held the original new drug application` nda' and was the sole_supplier of lymphazurinthe_r for 30 years
from its inception lymphazurinthe_rs production had been plagued by difficulties in synthesizing and purifying isb
hirschs original clinical trials described the mixture as containing 94.5 % isb as determined by hplc with the remaining 5.5 % consisting of` closely related_isomers' produced during synthesis

for 26 years following the food and drug administrations` fda' approval of isb sigma-aldrich corp.` sigma' supplied hirsch and its successors with isb that was manufactured by allied chemical corp.` allied'
allieds manufacturing_process was unknown but analysis of its isb indicated the presence of lead which suggested the use of a lead compound in synthesis
sigma developed an isolation process to remove the unwanted lead but the ultimate purity of the isb it sold was unknown
in 2000 allied stopped supplying sigma with isb and while sigma was looking for a new_supplier covidien was forced to notify its customers that it was` completely out of' lymphazurinthe_r until it could find a new_supplier for isb
id.at *2 internal_quotation_marks omitted
by 2008 sigma had a *863 new_supplier innovassynth which synthesized isb using ammonium dichromate resulting in residual chromium impurities
sigma reported numerous problems with the purity of innovassynths product and eventually developed its own manufacturing_process for isb sometime around 2010

apicore was founded in 2003 and began developing an improved process for synthesizing isb
in 2004 apicore partnered with synerx pharma llc` synerx' mylan_inst
's predecessor to develop and market a generic version of lymphazurinthe_r
in 2007 apicore filed a patent application that ultimately led to the process and050_patent s. based on the claimed process synerx acquired by mylan_inst
in 2012 filed an abbreviated new drug application` anda' seeking fda_approval to market a generic_lymphazurinthe_r ; the fda approved the anda in 2010
by 2011 isb sales were a significant portion of apicores revenue and in 2012 covidien withdrew lymphazurinthe_r from the market for` reasons other than safety or effectiveness'
id.at *3 internal_quotation_marks omitted
mylan_inst
became the sole_supplier of the 1 % isb drug product until 2016 when aurobindo entered the market

aurobindo sought fda_approval for a generic_lymphazurinthe_r informing the fda that it had studied a` number of patents' describing isb manufacture and selected inter_alia apicores992_patent and that it` considered the process described [ therein ] for the initial sample preparation and further the optimization of the process'
id
( internal_quotation_marks omitted
aurobindo acknowledged to the fda that it was looking for a reagent` other than silver_oxide'
id
( internal_quotation_marks omitted
it eventually selected manganese_dioxide and its process resulted in isb with a 5-10 % impurity which could not be removed by recrystallization
instead it used preparatory hplc to achieve an isb_purity of greater than 99.5 %
mylan sued aurobindo for infringement and sought a preliminary_injunction which the district_court granted

first the district_court2 evaluated the likelihood of success on the merits and found that aurobindo likely infringed the process_patents under the doctrine of equivalents
id.at *10-12
the court found that the difference in oxidation_strength between silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide is` irrelevant' under both the` function-way-result'` fwr' and` insubstantial_differences' tests for equivalence as applied to the` face of the claims' because the claims do not specify a requirement of oxidation_strength
id.at *11
further the court explained that even if oxidation_strength were relevant it` finds manganese_dioxide to be a mild oxidant equivalent to silver_oxide in the context of the [ process_patents ]'
id
the court credited dr. sesslers mylans expert testimony in light of record_evidence that the silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide_processes produce crude_isb in similar_yields
the court explained that if manganese_dioxide were a substantially stronger_oxidizing_agent than silver_oxide a skilled_artisan` would expect different_results'
id.at *12

the district_court found that aurobindo did not raise a substantial_question of validity of the050_patent based on its arguments that the process patent is invalid 1 under ¡± 112 because the` by hplc' limitation renders the claims indefinite ; 2 under ¡± 103 because the claims would have been obvious over various combinations of art ; and 3 under ¡± 102 because *864 the claims are anticipated by sigmas manufacture and sale of isb

on the issue of indefiniteness the district_court credited sesslers testimony and found that` by hplc' was a common and well-understood way of designating or determining purity as seen in` numerous_sources' including other_patents and the scientific_literature
id.at *8-9
thus the court concluded that aurobindo had not raised a substantial_question of validity of the050_patent under ¡± 112
id

the district_court also rejected aurobindos obviousness_argument finding that aurobindo did not raise a substantial_question regarding motivation to combine the references or a reasonable_expectation of success
see id.at *22
the court noted that` a purified_compound is not always prima_facie obvious over the [ prior_art ] mixture' if the process to arrive at the purified_compound is itself of patentable_weight

cir
2007 internal_quotation_marks omitted
the court concluded that apicores process leading to the purified_compound claimed in the050_patent constituted` an invention of patentable_weight itself' and thus the purity claims would not necessarily have been prima_facie obvious over the prior_art_mixture of less pure isb and` closely related_isomer [ ]' by-products
id.at *18 *19 internal_quotation_marks omitted

the district_court credited mylans evidence of secondary_considerations-specifically long-felt but unmet_need commercial_success copying/praise of others and unexpected_results
id.at *20-22
the court pointed to the failure of allied sigma innovassynth and others in the art to` reliably' produce` high-purity' isb for 30 years
id.at *20
and the court emphasized that aurobindo` admitted to the fda' that it had copied the992_patent
id.at *21
thus the court concluded that aurobindo had not raised a substantial_question that the050_patent is invalid as obvious
id

the district_court also concluded that aurobindo had not raised a substantial_question that the050_patent claims were anticipated under ¡± 102 b and ¡± 102 g 2 by sigmas manufacture and sale of isb
see id.at *13
aurobindo argued that sigma had made and sold isb having a purity of greater than 99.0 % six years before the050_patent priority date
see id
aurobindo supported its position by citing a sigma_certificate of analysis which indicated that a compound named` patent_violet_blue' with a certain product number and lot number possessed a purity that was 100 % by hplc
id
the court rejected aurobindos argument finding that 1 it is not clear that at the time of the certificate sigmas use of the term` patent_violet_blue' referred to isb because other_sigma_documents indicate that` patent_violet_blue' referred to several blue dye compounds with different structures ; and 2 the record established that the certificate is inaccurate because it` contradicts numerous other sigma [ ] documents' that report a different purity for samples from the same_lot
id.at *14
thus the court concluded that aurobindo had not raised a substantial_question that the050_patent is invalid as anticipated
id

second the district_court found that apicore3 would be irreparably harmed without a preliminary_injunction and identified four` hallmark examples' of irreparable_harm that are demonstrated by the *865 record lost sales ; lost r & d ; price_erosion ; and that apicore must now directly compete with an infringer
id.at *23 ; order adopting r & r 2017_wl_497593 at *1

the district_court found a` causal_nexus' between aurobindos infringement and apicores harm in that aurobindos product` would not be on the market if [ it ] had not obtained [ fda ] approval for a product that will likely be found to be covered by the patents'
order adopting r & r 2017_wl_497593 at *1
the court noted that` [ w ] ithout infringing the992616 and050_patent s aurobindo would not be able to make the [ isb ] product described in its anda' because aurobindos anda_application touted greater than 99.0 % purity for isb
report and recommendation 2016_wl_7587325 at *24

third the district_court found that the balance of equities weighed in favor of granting the injunction
id
the court emphasized that apicore` stands to lose its entire [ isb ] business.. which it relies on to fund ongoing research and development' and that aurobindo was aware of apicores patented_process and copied it
id
thus the court found that the balance of equities favored apicore

``

finally the district_court found that the public_interest factor also favored granting the preliminary_injunction
the court observed that apicore satisfied its end of the patent bargain by disclosing its method for preparing isb and that it would likely not have done so if it had known that a competitor would use that method to destroy its isb business before it` could make it to trial'
id
the court emphasized that the public_interest in obtaining lower-priced pharmaceutical compounds can not justify` entirely eliminating the exclusionary rights covered by pharmaceutical patents'

we first consider whether the district_court erred in finding that mylan is likely to succeed on the merits because aurobindo` more likely than not' infringes the process_patents under the doctrine of equivalents
report and recommendation 2016_wl_7587325 at *12

a preliminary_injunction should not issue if the accused infringer` raises a substantial_question concerning either infringement or validity'
amazon.com 239 f.3d at 1350

aurobindo argues that it had raised a substantial_question of infringement of the process_patents under the doctrine of equivalents because manganese_dioxide oxidizes isoleuco_acid in a different way than silver_oxide in that manganese_dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent whereas silver_oxide is a weak oxidizing agent
additionally aurobindo continues manganese_dioxide oxidation requires the use of an acid and the patents specifically report the use of silver_oxide as not requiring an acid

mylan responds that the district_court correctly found a likelihood of success on the merits of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because the court properly found that manganese_dioxide and silver_oxide are equivalent in the context of the process_patents
specifically the court credited sesslers testimony in light of record_evidence that the silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide_processes produce crude_isb in similar_yields
the court explained that if manganese_dioxide was a substantially stronger_oxidizing_agent than silver_oxide a skilled_artisan` would expect different_results'
report and recommendation 2016_wl_7587325 at *12
that finding mylan argues was not clearly erroneous

as set forth below we conclude that the district_courts analysis of equivalence in this case was flawed no doubt because of the sparse and confusing case law concerning equivalents particularly the paucity of chemical equivalence case law and the difficulty of applying the legal concepts to the facts
we will attempt to provide more clarity on these subjects

this appeal is unusual in a first sense in that it arises from the grant of a preliminary_injunction based on the doctrine of equivalents
there are few such reported decisions but see e.g. pfizer inc. v. teva pharm. usa inc. 429_f.3d_1364 1378 fed
cir
2005 owing to the fact that equivalents cases are` highly factual inquir [ ies ] [ that ] rarely come [ ] clear on a premature record'

cir
2000
moreover the law on the doctrine of equivalents as applied to chemical materials is not clear and its misapplication can lead to unsound results
this appears to be such a case

in graver_tank the supreme_court set out two frameworks for evaluating equivalence-the familiar fwr_test viz. whether the accused product performs` substantially the same_function in substantially the same_way to obtain the same result' and the insubstantial_differences_test whether the accused product or process is substantially different from what is patented
*867 graver_tank & mfg co. v. linde air prod co. 339_u.s._605 608 609 70_s.ct._854 94_l.ed._1097_(1950)
the supreme_courts most recent visit with this branch of the law was in warner-jenkinson which dealt with whether a process of purification performed at a ph of 5 was equivalent to one performed at a ph of 6-9
warner-jenkinson_co. v. hilton_davis_chem co. 520_u.s._17 39 117_s.ct._1040 137_l.ed.2d_146_(1997)
the court noted that equivalence is not a` prisoner of formula' id.at 39 117_s.ct._1040 but also observed that non-mechanical cases may not be well-suited to consideration under the fwr_test see id.at 39-40 117_s.ct._1040` there seems to be substantial agreement that while the [ fwr ] test may be suitable for analyzing mechanical devices it often provides a poor framework for analyzing other products or processes
``

the supreme_court was surely correct in stating that non-mechanical cases may not be well-suited to consideration under the fwr_test
that seems to be particularly true in the chemical_arts
although in graver_tank the supreme_court recognized the use of fwr generally in chemical cases 339 u.s. at 608 70_s.ct._854` today the doctrine [ of equivalents ] is applied to mechanical or chemical equivalents in compositions or devices
`` the court later acknowledged in warner-jenkinson that the suitability of the two tests may vary depending on the circumstances of the case 520 u.s. at 40 117_s.ct._1040` different_linguistic_frameworks may be more suitable to different_cases depending on their particular_facts`
thus the court seemingly blessed two equivalents tests leaving to the lower courts in future cases the choice of which to apply

the district_court here applied the fwr_test in evaluating the equivalence issue.4 we will therefore review its decision first in that light
in doing so we conclude that the district_courts analysis of the process claims under fwr was flawed by being unduly truncated and hence incomplete

especially when evaluating an equivalents dispute dealing with chemical compositions having many components chemical_compounds with many substituents which are usually claimed as separate limitations and those having a medical or biological use it is often not clear what the` function' or` way' is for each claim limitation
how a particular component of a composition or substituent of a compound functions in a human or animal body or in what way may not be known or even knowable although as technology evolves that may change
and precedent requires that for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents each limitation must satisfy an equivalence test
see warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 40 117_s.ct._1040

the` result' of using a claimed compound may be more easily evaluated as the structure and uses of one compound may be directly compared with those of another
but as indicated above that is not how infringement under fwr is determined
it must be determined on a limitation-by-limitation basis
see id
similarly in the case of a chemical_process_claim as in this case the` result' of a process producing *868 a chemical compound may be clear5-why else would a claim for infringement of a process claim be brought if the claimed result is not obtained ?
but the` function' and` way' of a particular limitation of a chemical_process_claim may remain vague and often overlap
in some cases` way' and` function' may be synonymous

aurobindo argued before the district_court that the` function' prong of the fwr_test was not met because of the difference in oxidation_strength between silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide
but the court did not seem to address that argument which in actuality related to the` way' component of the fwr_test
the court stated that` [ c ] onverting the isoleuco_acid to isosulfan_blue_acid is the function of the silver_oxide' and then dismissed aurobindos oxidation_strength argument as` irrelevant' to the fwr and` insubstantial difference' tests
report and recommendation 2016_wl_7587325 at *11 emphasis added
nevertheless the court made a finding that silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide are` equivalent' in the context of the process_patents without considering the` way' prong of the fwr_test
id
in fact the court appeared to consider the relative_oxidation_strengths of silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide as a consideration for claim_construction rather than its equivalents_analysis
id.at *10-12 stating that the relative_oxidation_strengths are` irrelevant' for both the fwr and insubstantial_differences_tests and that aurobindo had not argued for a` narrow [ er ]' claim_construction that would read an oxidation_strength limitation into the claims but noting that a` more fully-developed factual record and claim_construction proceeding could change things' em-phases added

thus either the district_court did not address the` way' prong of the fwr_analysis-having considered the relative_oxidation_strengths to be an issue for claim_construction and rejecting aurobindos arguments about oxidation_strength because it had not argued for a narrow claim_construction-or it performed a` way' analysis without considering critical factors under that prong namely the relative_oxidation_strengths of silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide as well as the use of an acid in the accused process
either characterization constitutes error in the courts equivalents_analysis

the district_court correctly evaluated the` function' aspect of the fwr_test-deciding in effect that the function of the silver_oxide was to oxidize the precursor isoleuco compound to isb acid.6 but that is not considering the` way' the oxidation works
manganese_dioxide and silver_oxide may have the same_function but the question is whether they operate in the same_way
critical facts that might be considered in an equivalents_analysis include the relative_oxidation_strengths of the two oxidizing *869 agents as argued by aurobindo and the fact that manganese_dioxide requires the use of an acid for oxidation but silver dioxide does not and results in a different yield
all of this in fact may at trial indicate a different` way'
thus there is room for sufficient doubt as to whether silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide oxidize isoleuco_acid in the same_way so as to satisfy the` way' prong of the fwr_test

accordingly the district_court erred in its equivalents_analysis under fwr and we reverse its determination
when the case goes back to the district_court for a full_trial on the merits the court may wish to consider whether the substantiality of the differences_test may be more applicable in this case
even if evaluating the` function' and` way' prongs is feasible the fwr_test may be less appropriate for evaluating equivalence in chemical_compounds if it can not capture substantial differences between a claimed and accused compound

for example consider the well-known compounds aspirin and ibuprofen which chemists would not usually consider to be structural equivalents under the insubstantial_differences_test
chemical compounds are characterized by their structures and these two compounds differ substantially in structure see appendix
however the two compounds would seem to be substantial equivalents under the fwr_test
they each provide analgesia and anti-inflammatory activity` function' by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis` way' in order to alleviate pain reduce fevers and lessen inflammation` result'
see e.g. hilton_davis_chem co. v. warner-jenkinson_co. 62_f.3d_1512 1546 fed
cir
1995 lourie j. dissenting
thus a compound may appear to be equivalent under the fwr_test but not under the substantiality of the differences_test
hence the substantial_differences_test may be more suitable than fwr for determining equivalence in the chemical_arts
warner-jenkinson 520 u.s. at 40 117_s.ct._1040` different_linguistic_frameworks may be more suitable to different_cases depending on their particular_facts
``

in this case the district_court conducted an incomplete fwr_analysis while essentially bypassing the substantial_differences_test in a situation where the latter test might seemingly be more appropriate
the claims in the process_patents recite a method for preparing a specifically named compound by combining another specifically depicted compound with a third specific compound viz. silver_oxide
each of these compounds is expressly named and an infringement analysis must not take lightly the specific recitation of these materials
the district_court found that the accused process using manganese_dioxide was equivalent to the claimed process using silver_oxide
but the court failed to consider whether the key reagent in the process manganese_dioxide was substantially different from the claimed reagent silver_oxide and hence whether the substitution for and omission of silver_oxide left the accused infringer outside of the bounds of the claims

manganese_dioxide and silver_oxide are substantially different in many respects
for example manganese and silver are in different groups of the periodic table
in oxide form manganese has an oxidation state of +4 while silver is +1
those differences may well be relevant to equivalence at trial
thus the choice of test under the doctrine of equivalents may matter in this case

when the case returns to the district_court for a full_trial on the merits the court should in addition to providing further analysis regarding fulfillment of the fwr_test if it determines that it should still utilize that test also consider whether *870 an evaluation of equivalence under the substantial_differences_test may be better suited to the particular_facts of this case

in sum we conclude that the courts equivalents_analysis was deficient in its fwr_analysis
because on the record there remains a substantial_question concerning infringement we conclude that the courts grant of a preliminary_injunction based on the process_patents constituted an abuse of discretion
thus we modify7 the courts grant of the preliminary_injunction to premise it only on its evaluation of the050_patent as will be discussed infra

ii
'050_patent
we next consider whether the district_court erred in finding that aurobindo did not raise a substantial_question as to validity of the050_patent
id.at *14 *23
aurobindo does not appeal the courts finding that it` more likely than not' infringes the050_patent
id.at *12
thus the preliminary_injunction premised on the050_patent will stand unless aurobindo raised a substantial_question concerning the validity of the patent or unless the court erroneously found irreparable_harm
we find that the court did not err in either respect

aurobindo argues that the claims of the050_patent are anticipated by sigmas isb_product because a sigma_certificate of analysis shows that sigma made and sold isb with a purity of 100 % six years before the relevant_date of the050_patent
furthermore aurobindo argues that the050_patent would have been obvious over lymphazurinthe_r itself because the prior_art taught the use of hplc and other conventional purification techniques for purifying isb
finally aurobindo argues that the050_patent is invalid because the limitation` having a purity of at least 99.0 % by hplc' is indefinite
aurobindo contends that different hplc parameters will produce different_results in a purity analysis and thus because the claims do not specify hplc parameters they are indefinite

mylan responds that the district_courts findings regarding a lack of a substantial_question of validity due to anticipation obviousness and indefiniteness were not clearly erroneous

we agree with mylan
aurobindo points to no legal_error in the district_courts analysis of the record_evidence ; rather it argues only that the court erred in` misreading the factual content of the prior_art'

the district_court rejected aurobindos argument that the050_patent claims are anticipated by sigmas manufacture and sale of isb because it found that the sigma_certificate of analysis related to a compound named` patent_violet_blue' and it was not clear that at the time of the issuance of the certificate sigma used that term to refer to isb
additionally the certificate contradicts other_sigma_documents that report different purity levels for samples from the same_lot
report and recommendation 2016_wl_7587325 at *14
we discern no clear_error in those findings

*871 the district_court also rejected aurobindos obviousness_argument finding that aurobindo did not raise a substantial_question regarding motivation to combine the references or a reasonable_expectation of success
see id.at *22
the court found that apicores process leading to the claimed isb_product with a purity of greater than 99.0 % constituted` an invention of patentable_weight itself' and thus that the050_patent claims would not necessarily have been prima_facie obvious over the prior_art_mixture of less pure isb and` closely related_isomer [ ]' by-products
id.at *18 *19 internal_quotation_marks omitted

finally the district_court rejected aurobindos argument that the050_patent claims are invalid as indefinite
the court found that the phrase` by hplc' was a` common and well understood way of designating purity in publications and patents that are relied upon by the scientific and technical community'
id.at *8 quoting sesslers testimony
the court found that` numerous_sources' support that determination including patents filed before the relevant_date of the050_patent

we see no error in the district_courts analysis
we have previously acknowledged that` a purified_compound is not always prima_facie obvious over the [ prior_art ] mixture' if the process to arrive at the purified_compound is itself of patentable_weight
aventis 499 f.3d at 1301
moreover if the prior_art teaches a mixture containing a compound but does not enable its purification then the purified form of the compound may not have been obvious over the prior_art_mixture

the court expressly relied on the aventis proposition in making its determination
report and recommendation 2016_wl_7587325 at *17-18 quoting aventis 499 f.3d at 1301
we see no error in its analysis
it is clear from the record here that although isb was known in the prior_art the path to arrive at isb with a purity of greater than 99.0 % was not known before the relevant_date of the050_patent

furthermore the district_court credited mylans evidence of secondary_considerations-specifically long-felt but unmet_need commercial_success copying/praise of others and unexpected_results
id.at *20-22
the court relied on record_evidence showing the failure of allied sigma innovassynth and others in the art to` reliably' produce` high-purity' isb for 30 years id.at *20 and that aurobindo` admitted to the fda' that it had copied the992_patent id.at *21
there is no clear_error in the courts findings
in fact the record demonstrates that prior to the050_patents relevant_date a reliable source of high-purity isb was so scarce that at one point covidien was forced to notify its customers that it was` completely out of' lymphazurinthe_r until it could find a new_supplier for isb
id.at *2 internal_quotation_marks omitted

finally there is no error in the courts determination that the050_patent is likely not invalid as indefinite
the courts finding was supported by substantial_record_evidence including the scientific_literature and other_patents reporting purity using the same` by hplc' designation without providing specific_hplc_parameters
id.at *8
the court found that even dr. browns testimony aurobindos *872 expert admitted that` purity by hplc' is typically used in fda submissions for describing purity levels
id.at *9
thus the court determined that a skilled_artisan` would readily understand' the phrase and would be able to` elucidate hplc conditions' for determining isb_purity
id
we see no error in that finding

thus we see no error in the courts legal analysis or its factual_findings pertaining to validity of the050_patent particularly at the preliminary_injunction_stage of the litigation

iii
irreparable harm
finally we consider whether the district_court erred in finding a likelihood that apicore will sustain` substantial and immediate irreparable injury' without preliminary_relief

aurobindo argues that the district_court erred in finding a causal_nexus between apicores alleged harm and the patented features of the process and050_patent s. aurobindo contends that the patented features are the use of silver_oxide to oxidize isoleuco_acid and that the isb employed in the finished drug product is at least 99.0 % pure by hplc
however aurobindo argues there is no evidence that the consumer_demand for mylans product arises from the fact that the isb it contained was synthesized using silver_oxide or that the isb is at least 99.0 % pure ; in fact argues aurobindo that information is not available anywhere on mylans marketing materials for its isb drug product
rather aurobindo continues the record shows that there was no consumer_demand for the patented product because lymphazurinthe_r was commercially successful until mylan_inst
's product drove it out of the market due to pricing-not due to the difference in the manufacturing_process or purity of the isb it contains

mylan responds that aurobindos causal_nexus argument is flawed because it improperly focuses on a subset of the relevant customers physicians and ignores all others active pharmaceutical ingredient` api' suppliers pharma companies hospitals the fda etc
mylan maintains that apicores harm is directly caused by aurobindos infringement because ample evidence shows sigmas difficulty in finding an acceptable isb supplier and that by admittedly copying apicores patented_process aurobindo gained a competitive advantage

we agree with mylan that the district_courts determinations were not clearly erroneous
on the record_evidence the court found that 1 due to aurobindos infringement apicore has and will continue to suffer from lost sales lost research and development price_erosion and having to directly compete with an infringer id.at *23 ; 2 there was a causal_nexus between aurobindos infringement and apicores harm because aurobindos product` would not be on the market if [ it ] had not obtained [ fda ] approval for a product that will likely be found to be covered by the patents' order adopting r & r 2017_wl_497593 at *1 ; and 3` [ w ] ithout infringing the [ process and purity ] patents aurobindo would not be able to make the [ isb ] product described in its anda' report and recommendation 2016_wl_7587325 at *24

those findings do not constitute clear_error
aurobindo argues that the court could not rely on the fdas approval of aurobindos anda_application to automatically *873 find a causal_nexus between apicores harm and aurobindos infringement
but that is not what the court found or how the court used that evidence
the record_evidence shows aurobindos admitted copying of apicores992_patent id.at *4 aurobindos anda promising an isb_purity of greater than 99.0 % id.at *24 and the failure of all others in the art to obtain an isb_purity of greater than 94.5 % until the invention of the050_patent id.at *20
thus the district_court reasonably found that` [ w ] ithout infringing the [ process and050 ] patents aurobindo would not be able to make the [ isb ] product described in its anda'
id.at *24
in making that determination the court did not rely on regulatory approval to automatically confer a causal_nexus as aurobindo argues
rather it made a reasoned factual determination supported by substantial_record_evidence
we see no legal_error in the courts analysis and no clear_error in its factual_findings

aurobindo does not challenge the district_courts findings that the balance of equity and public_interest factors weigh in favor of granting the preliminary_injunction
thus because we find no error in the courts determination that aurobindo has not raised a substantial_question of validity of the050_patent and that apicore will be irreparably harmed without preliminary_relief we affirm the district_courts grant of the preliminary_injunction premised on the050_patent

conclusion
we have considered the parties remaining arguments but find them to be unpersuasive
for the reasons set forth above we modify the courts grant of a preliminary_injunction by premising it only on the050_patent

affirmed

because the992616 and050_patent s have the same written description when referring to the written description of any of the patents we will cite only the992_patent for simplicity

the court only analyzed` irreparable_harm' as to apicore a fact that neither party challenges on appeal
4
we note that the district_court recognized that the fwr_test` may inform whether insubstantial_differences exist between a claim element and an accused element'
report and recommendation 2016_wl_7587325 at *11
under that analysis the district_court concluded that` the oxidation_strength of manganese_dioxide is irrelevant under the insubstantial difference test' dismissing any consideration of oxidation_strength on claim_construction_grounds as will be discussed further below
id
thus the district_court did not evaluate whether silver_oxide and manganese_dioxide are insubstantially different
5
in this case the parties did not dispute the` result' prong before the magistrate_judge but did do so before the district_court_judge who did not address those arguments
thus the court never made a finding on the` result' prong
however we need not decide whether that constituted reversible error because we modify the preliminary_injunction for other reasons set forth herein below
6
we note that the court seemed to make a finding as to the` function' prong without stating it as such
it acknowledged that aurobindo only disputed the` function' of the oxidizing agents but then stated that` [ c ] onverting the isoleuco_acid to isosulfan_blue_acid is the function of the silver_oxide' while rejecting aurobindos arguments on claim_construction_grounds
id.at *11 emphasis added
we will treat that part of the courts analysis as its finding under the` function' prong of the fwr_test
7
ordinarily a failure by the district_court to properly apply the doctrine of equivalents would warrant a remand
however because the injunction will stand under the050_patent as will be discussed infra we see no need to expend judicial resources and litigation expenses on a remand
thus we will modify the district_courts decision by affirming the grant of a preliminary_injunction premised only on the050_patent
