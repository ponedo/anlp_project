( `` Alza '' ) appeals from the district court 's judgment , after a bench trial , of noninfringement and invalidity of claims 1-3 , 11 , 13 and 14 of U.S. Patent No . 6,124,3551 ( `` the '355 patent '' ) in favor of Mylan Laboratories , Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ( collectively , `` Mylan '' ) . Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs. , Inc. , 388 F.Supp.2d 717 ( N.D.W.Va.2005 ) ( `` Alza II `` ) . The infringement arose from Mylan 's filing of two Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( `` ANDAs '' ) for a generic version of the once-a-day extended release formulation of the anti-incontinence drug oxybutynin , id . at 720 , which Alza has been marketing as Ditropan XL ( r ) . Id . at 738 . This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . For the reasons stated below , we affirm the district court 's judgment of noninfringement and invalidity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ This litigation arose from Mylan 's and Impax 's filings of ANDAs for once-daily , controlled-release oxybutynin formulations . Oxybutynin is a drug used to treat urinary incontinence . Once-a-day dosing provides the usual benefits of convenience , steady-dosing , and in addition , possibly reduced absorption of a metabolite that leads to side-effects . Claim 2 of the '355 patent is representative . _NEWLINE_ 2 . A sustained-release oxybutynin formulation for oral administration to a patient in need of treatment for urge incontinence comprising a therapeutic dose of an oxybutynin selected from the group consisting of oxybutynin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt that delivers from 0 to 1 mg in 0 to 4 hours , from 1 mg to 2.5 mg in 0 to 8 hours , from 2.75 to 4.25 mg in 0 to 14 hours , and 3.75 mg to 5 mg in 0 to 24 hours for *1289 treating urge incontinence in the patient . _NEWLINE_ col. 17 , ll . 31-38 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court construed the '355 patent claims in its Markman Order , reported at Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs. , Inc. , 349 F.Supp.2d 1002 ( N.D.W.Va.2004 ) ( `` Alza I `` ) . The court construed the word `` deliver '' to refer to the rate of in vivo release in the gastrointestinal ( `` GI '' ) tract . See id . at 1019 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Alza did not present direct evidence that Mylan 's ANDA formulation released drug in the GI tract at the rates claimed by the '355 patent . However , it did offer two other types of evidence : 1 ) the rate at which the generic product released oxybutynin in an in vitro dissolution apparatus , and 2 ) the rate at which the ANDA product resulted in the accumulation of oxybutynin in the bloodstream . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that Alza had failed to meet its burden of proof on infringement . The district court also found the asserted claims of the '355 patent to be invalid as both anticipated and obvious in light of the prior art . For the reasons stated below , we affirm the invalidity holding on obviousness grounds , and consequently , we do not need to reach Alza 's arguments regarding anticipation . We also affirm the holding of noninfringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Standard of review _NEWLINE_ Infringement is a question of fact that , after a bench trial , we review for clear error . See , e.g. , Ferguson Beauregard/Logic Controls , Div . of Dover Res. , Inc. v. Mega Sys. , LLC , 350 F.3d 1327 , 1338 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . Under the clear error standard , a reversal is permitted only when this court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court was in error . Medichem , S.A. v. Rolabo , S.L. , 437 F.3d 1157 , 1164 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As for obviousness , a claimed invention is unpatentable if the differences between it and the prior art are `` such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) ( 2000 ) ; In re Kahn , 441 F.3d 977 , 985 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( citing Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 13-14 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 , ( 1966 ) ) . Obviousness is a question of law , reviewed de novo , based upon underlying factual questions which are reviewed for clear error following a bench trial . Ruiz v. A.B . Chance Co. , 357 F.3d 1270 , 1275 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) . These `` underlying factual inquiries includ [ e ] : ( 1 ) the scope and content of the prior art ; ( 2 ) the level of ordinary skill in the prior art ; ( 3 ) the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art ; and ( 4 ) objective evidence of nonobviousness . '' In re Dembiczak , 175 F.3d 994 , 998 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . Similarly , `` [ t ] he presence or absence of a motivation to combine references in an obviousness determination is a pure question of fact , '' In re Gartside , 203 F.3d 1305 , 1316 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ; accord Winner Int ' l Royalty Corp. v. Wang , 202 F.3d 1340 , 1348 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) , as is the presence or absence of a `` reasonable expectation of success '' from making such a combination , Medichem , S.A. v. Rolabo , S.L. , 437 F.3d 1157 , 1165 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) . Because `` a patent retains its statutory presumption of validity , see 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 , ... the movant retains the burden to show the invalidity of the claims by clear and convincing evidence as to underlying facts . '' McGinley v. Franklin Sports , Inc. , 262 F.3d 1339 , 1349 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( internal quotations omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Graham , the Court held that that the obviousness analysis begins with several basic factual inquiries : `` [ ( 1 ) ] the scope *1290 and content of the prior art are to be determined ; [ ( 2 ) ] differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and [ ( 3 ) ] the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved . '' 383 U.S. at 17 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . After ascertaining these facts , the Court held that the obviousness vel non of the invention is then determined `` against th [ e ] background `` of the Graham factors . Id . at 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 ( emphasis added ) . Clearly , the Court recognized the importance of guarding against hindsight , as is evident in its discussion of the role of secondary considerations as `` serv [ ing ] to guard against slipping into use of hindsight and to resist the temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue . '' Id . at 36 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 's and its predecessor 's `` motivation to combine '' requirement likewise prevents statutorily proscribed hindsight reasoning when determining the obviousness of an invention . Kahn , 441 F.3d at 986 ( `` [ T ] he 'motivation-suggesting-teaching ' requirement protects against the entry of hindsight into the obviousness analysis . `` ) ; In re Fridolph , 30 C.C.P.A . 939 , 942 , 134 F.2d 414 ( 1943 ) ( `` [ I ] n considering more than one reference , the question always is : does such art suggest doing the thing the [ inventor ] did. '' ) . According to the `` motivation-suggesting-teaching '' test , a court must ask `` whether a person of ordinary skill in the art , possessed with the understandings and knowledge reflected in the prior art , and motivated by the general problem facing the inventor , would have been led to make the combination recited in the claims . '' Kahn , 441 F.3d at 988 ( citing Cross Med . Prods. , Inc. , v. Medtronic Sofamor Danek , Inc. , 424 F.3d 1293 , 1321-24 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This requirement has been developed consistent with the Supreme Court 's obviousness jurisprudence as expressed in Graham and the text of the obviousness statute that directs us to conduct the obviousness inquiry `` at the time the invention was made '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . As we explained in Kahn , _NEWLINE_ The motivation-suggestion-teaching test picks up where the analogous art test leaves off and informs the Graham analysis . To reach a non-hindsight driven conclusion as to whether a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would have viewed the subject matter as a whole to have been obvious in view of multiple references , the Board must provide some rationale , articulation , or reasoned basis to explain why the conclusion of obviousness is correct . The requirement of such an explanation is consistent with governing obviousness law ... . _NEWLINE_ 441 F.3d at 987 . We further explained that the `` motivation to combine '' requirement `` [ e ] ntails consideration of both the 'scope and content of the prior art ' and 'level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art ' aspects of the Graham test . '' Id . at 986 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At its core , our anti-hindsight jurisprudence is a test that rests on the unremarkable premise that legal determinations of obviousness , as with such determinations generally , should be based on evidence rather than on mere speculation or conjecture . Our court 's analysis in Kahn bears repeating : _NEWLINE_ A suggestion , teaching , or motivation to combine the relevant prior art teachings does not have to be found explicitly in the prior art , as `` the teaching , motivation , or suggestion may be implicit from the prior art as a whole , rather than expressly stated in the references ... . The test for an implicit showing is what the combined teachings , knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art , and the nature of the problem to be *1291 solved as a whole would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art . '' However , rejections on obviousness grounds can not be sustained by mere conclusory statements ; instead , there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness . This requirement is as much rooted in the Administrative Procedure Act [ for our review of Board determinations ] , which ensures due process and non-arbitrary decisionmaking , as it is in ¡± 103 . _NEWLINE_ 441 F.3d at 987-88 ( quoting In re Kotzab , 217 F.3d 1365 , 1370 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ) ( citations omitted ) ( emphases added ) ) . There is flexibility in our obviousness jurisprudence because a motivation may be found implicitly in the prior art . We do not have a rigid test that requires an actual teaching to combine before concluding that one of ordinary skill in the art would know to combine references . This approach , moreover , does not exist merely in theory but in practice , as well . Our recent decisions in Kahn and in Cross Medical Products amply illustrate the current state of this court 's views . See Kahn , 441 F.3d at 988 ( affirming the PTO 's obviousness finding , explaining that a motivation to combine may be found in implicit factors , such as the `` knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art , and [ what ] the nature of the problem to be solved as a whole would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art '' ) ; Cross Med . Prods. , 424 F.3d at 1322 ( reversing a district court ruling of nonobviousness and explaining that `` the motivation to combine need not be found in prior art references , but equally can be found in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art '' such as knowledge of a problem to be solved ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In conclusion , our approach has permitted us to continue to address an issue of law not readily amenable to bright-line rules , as we recall and are guided by the wisdom of the Supreme Court in striving for a `` practical test of patentability . '' Graham , 383 U.S. at 17 , 86 S.Ct . 684 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Description of the technology _NEWLINE_ The patent at issue is directed generally to an extended release form of oxybutynin . Because the subject matter of the patent falls roughly under the rubric of pharmacology , we give a brief orientation to the field , based upon the record . In general , when a drug is swallowed , it is ( 1 ) dissolved in the gastrointestinal ( `` GI '' ) tract ; ( 2 ) absorbed from the GI tract into the bloodstream ; ( 3 ) distributed from the blood into body tissues ; and ( 4 ) metabolized and eliminated from the bloodstream . The GI tract includes the stomach , small intestine and the colon , and orally administered drugs pass through these portions of the GI tract in turn . Drugs may be administered in different dosage forms,2 which may include not only the drug itself but also ingredients intended to modulate the rate of release of the drug from the dosage form . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dosage forms may be described as immediate-release , e.g. , such as where the drug is quickly released in the stomach , or as sustained/extended-release , where the drug is slowly released as the formulation traverses the GI tract . The rate of absorption of a drug from the GI tract into the bloodstream may change as it passes through the GI tract . The rate of absorption for a dissolved drug in a given portion of the GI tract also varies from drug to drug . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After roughly 8-12 hours a typical dosage form will reach the colon . If , hypothetically , a particular drug is simply not absorbed from the colon into the bloodstream , *1292 then it may make little sense to develop an extended-release dosage form that is capable of `` withholding '' the release of some fraction of that drug until it reaches the colon . In other words , under these hypothetical conditions , there may be little motivation to design an oral dosage form capable of releasing drug more slowly than over an approximately 8-12 hour time course , because such drug would be released in the colon , where it is ( hypothetically ) not absorbed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '355 patent claims an extended release oxybutynin formulation . Alza argues that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have believed that oxybutynin could be absorbed in the colon . Absent such absorption , Alza contends that one of ordinary skill in the art lacked the motivation to make the claimed extended release formulation , and that the district court therefore erred in holding that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious over the prior art . For the reasons set forth below , Alza 's arguments fail . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. Invalidity _NEWLINE_ The district court based its invalidity holding both on anticipation and obviousness grounds . Because we affirm its holding based on obviousness , we do not need to address the parties ' anticipation arguments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In finding the asserted claims of the '355 patent to be obvious , the district court considered , inter alia , the following prior art : U.S Patent Nos . 5,399,359 ( `` the Baichwal patent '' ) ; 5,082,688 ( `` the Wong patent '' ) ; and 5,330,766 ( `` the Morella patent '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Morella patent discloses a `` sustained-release pharmaceutical composition including an active ingredient of high solubility in water ... . '' According to the specification , highly soluble drugs had posed special challenges for the development of sustained release forms , which the inventors had set out to solve . `` Sustained-release '' is defined as release of the active ingredient at a rate that maintains therapeutic , non-toxic blood levels `` over an extended period of time e.g . 10 to 24 hours or greater . '' Highly water soluble drugs were considered to be those having an aqueous solubility of at least roughly 1 part in 30 . The commercially available hydrochloride salt of oxybutynin is freely soluble at neutral pH . The patent uses morphine as an example of an active ingredient that can be used in its compositions . Figure 5 demonstrates that one such composition is capable of dispensing morphine at what appears to be an approximately steady rate over the course of 24 hours . Claim 2 of the patent claims `` genitourinary smooth muscle relaxants '' as one of several types of active ingredients to use in the dosage form identified in claim 1 . The specification also identifies oxybutynin as a highly water soluble genitourinary smooth muscle relaxant . Morella also teaches that `` the dissolution rate of the soluble drug at various pH 's can be modified at will . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Baichwal patent teaches a 24 hour extended release oxybutynin formulation . These formulations use an enteric-coated polymer matrix similar to Mylan 's accused product . It also teaches methods of modifying the dosage forms to slow the release rates . During prosecution of the '355 patent , the inventor overcame an anticipation rejection by arguing that his invention had a release rate slower than those of the dissolution data presented in Baichwal.3 The examiner agreed and withdrew his rejection . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1293 The Wong patent teaches a bilayer osmotic pump dosage form ( `` the OROS system '' ) used in the preferred embodiment of the '355 patent . Wong teaches that this system can be used to deliver any drug over a 24 hour period , and Figure 11 of the patent discloses release rates falling within the claimed release rates of the '355 patent . The Wong patent does not specifically teach using oxybutynin with the claimed release technology , but it does teach using several categories of drugs of which oxybutynin is a member , such as anti-cholinergics , analgesis , muscle relaxants and urinary tract drugs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In analyzing the obviousness issue , the district court first identified the level of ordinary skill in the art , finding the person of ordinary skill to have either an advanced degree in pharmacy , biology , chemistry or chemical engineering and at least two years of experience with controlled-release technology ; or a bachelor 's degree in one ( or more ) of those fields plus five years of experience with such technology . Second , the court examined whether there was a motivation `` in the prior art or elsewhere that would have led one of the ordinary skill in the art to combine references , '' Alza II , 388 F.Supp.2d at 737 ( citing Ruiz , 234 F.3d at 664 ( internal quotations omitted ) ) , and with a `` reasonable expectation of success , '' id . ( citing In re O'Farrell , 853 F.2d 894 , 904 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ) . Third , the district court examined secondary considerations of nonobviousness . After making these factual determinations , it concluded that Mylan had established a strong prima facie case of obviousness , which Alza had failed to rebut through secondary considerations . The court concluded that Mylan had demonstrated Alza 's patent to be invalid for obviousness by clear and convincing evidence.4 We agree . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While we have carefully considered all of the parties ' arguments , we discuss principally the dispute over satisfaction of one predicate to a finding of obviousness : that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had a `` motivation to combine '' the prior art to achieve the claimed invention and that she would have had a `` reasonable expectation of success '' in doing so . As an initial matter , we agree with the district court that `` on a purely mechanical level , a person of ordinary skill in the art would have a reasonable expectation of success of manufacturing a 24 hour controlled-release oxybutynin formulation ... . once motivated to use oxybutynin . '' Id . at 739 . For example , Wong teaches a rate adjustable extended release dosing technology and release rates falling within the claimed parameters . Baichwal and Wong likewise teach ways of achieving slow rates of release , with Baichwal actually teaching extended-release oxybutynin , although arguably not as slowly as is claimed in the '355 patent.5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Indeed , Alza 's principal argument is that no one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to adapt the Morella , Baichwal and Wong technology to oxybutynin in the first place , because a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had no reason to expect that such an extended release oxybutynin formulation would have therapeutic value . The issues , as explained above , reduce essentially to whether one of ordinary skill in the art in 1995 would have had a reasonable expectation *1294 that oxybutynin would be colonically absorbed and therefore would have been motivated to produce the claimed extended release formulation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that `` the weight of the evidence clearly and convincingly establishes that a person of ordinary skill in the art in 1995 would reasonably expect oxybutynin to absorb in the colon ... [ and ] have a reasonable expectation of success of producing a 24 hour oxybuytnin formulation meeting the claims of the '355 patent . `` 6 Alza II , 388 F.Supp.2d at 740 . Alza argues , however , that the district court erred because `` [ t ] here was no prior art evidence supporting this finding . '' According to Alza , `` [ t ] here was no contemporaneous documentation supporting the view that any one factor-lipophilicity or anything else-existed to identify successful candidates for once-a-day delivery . '' It also argues that two prior art references `` decisively undercut '' the opinion of Mylan 's expert , Dr. Amidon , which the district court cited in support of its conclusion . See Alza II , 388 F.Supp.2d at 739-740 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As an initial matter , it is essential to recognize that , as we have explained above , under our non-rigid `` motivation-suggesting-teaching '' test , a suggestion to combine need not be found in the prior art . See Cross Med . Prods. , 424 F.3d at 1322 ( `` [ T ] he motivation to combine need not be found in prior art references , but equally can be found in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art ... . '' ) . Accordingly , where the testimony of an expert witness is relevant to determining the knowledge that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have possessed at a given time , this is one kind of evidence that is pertinent to our evaluation of a prima facie case of obviousness . We now turn to consider whether the relevant evidence , including the expert testimony and the prior art , when viewed as a whole supports the findings of the district court . We conclude that the findings of the district court were not clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Mylan 's expert , Dr. Amidon , testified that based on its lipophilicity , he would `` expect oxybutynin to be a highly permeable '' compound that is `` rapidly absorbed '' along the length of the GI tract , including the colon . Later , when challenged about the predictive value of lipophilicity , Dr. Amidon explained , `` I would say there were some unknowns , but again lipophilic drugs would be well absorbed . That would be-that was the general understanding at the time . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although Alza argues that two prior art references `` decisively undercut Dr. Amidon 's hindsight opinion , '' these references are in fact not inconsistent with the general principle that the extent of a drug 's colonic absorption correlates with its lipophilicity . Indeed , the first reference , a 1990 publication in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences , states that `` [ i ] n general , the more lipophilic drugs were transported rapidly . '' P. Artursson , Epithelial Transport of Drugs in Cell Culture . I : A Model for Studying the Passive Diffusion of Drugs over Intestinal Absorptive ( Caco-2 ) Cells . 79 J. Pharm . Sci . 476 , 481 ( 1990 ) . *1295 Alza , however , cites this reference narrowly for its observation that a highly lipophilic analog of a particular drug did not follow the general rule that lipophilic drugs were transported more quickly . Id . Granted , the authors admit that `` [ t ] he reason for this [ deviation ] is currently unknown , '' and they postulate that it may be related to a physicochemical factor other than lipophilicity , namely steric hindrance.7 Id . But the mere fact that the colonic absorption rate of a drug may be predicted most precisely by using `` many factors , '' rather than `` lipophilicity '' alone , does not negate the general predictive utility of lipophilicity in estimating the extent of colonic absorption . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The second prior art reference cited by Alza , Absorption of Polar Drugs Following Caecal Instillation in Healthy Volunteers , is similarly unavailing to it . Riley , et al. , 6 Aliment . Pharmacol . Ther . 701 , 705 ( 1992 ) . Again , this reference teaches that while the correlation is not perfect , lipophilicity tended to suggest colonic absorption , stating that `` [ t ] he relationship between the physical characteristics of a drug and its colonic absorption is not yet clear but studies in the rat suggest that lipophilic drugs are well absorbed along the length of the gastrointestinal tract , whereas hydrophobic polar drugs are absorbed much less from the colon than from the small intestine . '' Id . ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Far from teaching away or detracting from the weight of Dr. Amidon 's testimony , these prior art references , taken as a whole , are entirely consistent with the finding that in 1995 a person of ordinary skill in the art would have expected a general , albeit imperfect , correlation between a drug 's lipophilicity and its colonic absorptivity . Accordingly , we can not perceive clear error in the district court 's factual findings that while colonic absorption was not guaranteed , the evidence , viewed as a whole , is clear and convincing that a person of ordinary skill in the art would nonetheless have perceived a reasonable likelihood of success and that she would have been motivated to combine prior art references to make the claimed invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Likewise , we find no error in the district court 's consideration of secondary indicia of obviousness . We therefore affirm its legal conclusion of obviousness , finding the district court to have correctly held that Mylan met its burden of overcoming the presumption of validity that attaches to an issued patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D. Infringement _NEWLINE_ The '355 patent specifically describes the rate of oxybutynin release from its `` extended release '' formulations , requiring that the time-course of in vivo oxybutynin release falls within certain boundaries . That is , at certain times , the cumulative amount of dissolved ( released ) drug must fall within certain ranges . To prove infringement , Alza bore the burden of proving , inter alia , that Mylan 's accused generic formulation exhibited an in vivo release profile falling within the claimed ranges at the relevant times . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At trial , Alza presented no direct evidence of how quickly the accused product dissolved in vivo . Alza II , at 722 . However , it did offer two kinds of indirect evidence as measures of the rate of in vivo release . Id . First , it presented evidence of the blood plasma concentration versus time profiles for both the accused ANDA formulation and Ditropan , an embodiment *1296 of the '355 patent . Second , it presented evidence of the rate of release not in the GI tract but in pieces of laboratory apparatus under certain experimental conditions , so-called in vitro dissolution . The critical deficiency in the evidence presented by Alza was not that it was `` indirect '' rather than `` direct , '' but rather that it failed to credibly link these pieces of evidence with the relevant pharmacokinetic parameter-the rate of in vivo dissolution in the GI tract . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , the district court explained that Alza had failed to demonstrate how evidence of the rate of dissolution of drug in the GI tract could be extracted from plots of plasma concentration versus time . The district court accepted Alza 's simplifying assumption about oxybutynin rapidly being absorbed following dissolution such that the rates of in vivo dissolution parallel the rate of drug uptake into the blood . However , it found that only one expert , Dr. Amidon , had `` endorsed Alza 's subjective comparison of blood plasma levels with in vivo release rates . '' As for that one expert , moreover , he `` rejected the very conclusion that Alza attributed to him . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Alza criticizes the district court for `` fail [ ing ] to come to grips with the significance of the testimony '' that Dr. Amidon `` recanted ... immediately after he made it . '' Specifically , Alza urges that notwithstanding the expert 's recantation , we should nonetheless draw our independent conclusions from the `` point of his testimony '' that release rates in blood and the appearance in the GI tract are essentially the same . We have considered Alza 's arguments and find them to lack legal and factual coherency . Even if we were to presume to be experts and to apply the simplifying assumption that the drug is rapidly taken up into the bloodstream upon dissolution , it is not clear to us how to abstract from each plasma concentration versus time curve the rate of uptake into the bloodstream . This would require factoring out of the curve the effects , inter alia , of the elimination of drug from the bloodstream over the relevant 24 hour period . But this is not our province . Such evidence , if it exists , must have been presented at trial , or in its stead other evidence sufficient to persuade the trial court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ From what can be discerned , Dr. Amidon 's immediately recanted statement appears to have been based on his comparison of the relative areas under the curves of plasma concentration versus time plots of both the accused ANDA formulation and Ditropan XL . Indeed , Alza reproduces in its appellate brief Dr. Amidon 's testimony that the accused product has only 92 to 93 percent of the area under the curve of Ditropan XL . This appears to have resulted in the drawing of a line ( referred to by the parties as `` line A '' ) on a plot of in vitro dissolution of both Ditropan XL and the accused ANDA formulation , wherein the rate of in vitro dissolution of Mylan 's ANDA formulation has been adjusted according to that percentage . The basis for , and significance of , line A is simply not apparent from the record , and Alza fails to provide us with any persuasive line of argument as to how we should imbue line A with any relevant meaning . In short , we agree with Mylan that the plasma concentration versus time data fail to establish in vivo release rates for either Ditropan XL or the accused ANDA product . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court similarly found unpersuasive Alza 's evidence that Ditropan XL and the accused ANDA product sometimes exhibited in vitro dissolution rates falling within the claims . The court cited testimony by Dr. Amidon explaining that these in vitro procedures are `` not designed to reflect the in vivo dissolution process . '' This accords with the common sense notion that one can not simply proclaim without proof that he has constructed an apparatus capable of mimicking pertinent *1297 environmental variables of the GI tract ( along the length of the tract , nonetheless ) . Indeed , the obtained in vitro dissolution rates vary widely with the choice of experimental parameters . We agree with the district court that Alza 's evidence of in vitro dissolution rates is irrelevant absent evidence demonstrating that the in vitro system is a good model of actual in vivo behavior . On that point , Alza 's evidence is severely lacking . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We therefore affirm the district court 's finding of noninfringement . In so doing we explicitly reject Alza 's suggestion that the district court erred in failing to specifically state that not only did it find Alza 's plasma concentration data and its `` in vitro `` data to be inadequate in isolation , but that it had also found the data to be inadequate in combination . Even if we were to entertain the suggestion that the district court was in fact unfamiliar with the basic precept that it is the totality of the evidence that it must consider in making factual determinations , we would merely conclude that where as here , if each of two pieces of evidence , assessed separately , is severely inadequate to support a proposition , when their probative values are tallied , they still fall short . While it is possible to envision cases in which two pieces of evidence may create great probative value synergistically , this is not one of those cases . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * * * * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In conclusion , we affirm the judgment of the district court that the asserted claims of the '355 patent were invalid , and that notwithstanding , the patent was not infringed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ Costs to Mylan . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 464 F.3d 1286 , 80 U.S.P.Q.2d 1001 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '355 patent issued to Guittard et al . and was assigned to Alza . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here we are discussing oral dosage forms , specifically . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Tables 15 and 18 of Baichwal , for example , disclose in vitro dissolution rates in which roughly half of the drug is dissolved by four hours . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Having reviewed Alza 's sundry contentions that the district court made findings inconsistent with the appropriate burdens of proof for infringement and invalidity , we find them to be without merit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The patent examiner initially rejected the '355 patent as anticipated by Baichwal , but subsequently allowed its issuance . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '355 patent issued on September 26 , 2000 and claimed priority as far back as 1995 .

We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Luniewski was employed by Shamrock Technologies , Inc. ( Shamrock ) between May 1980 and July 1983 . As a condition of employment , he agreed to assign his work-related inventions to Shamrock . Luniewski and William Neuberg jointly invented an apparatus and method for processing polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) with radiation . On March 26 , 1982 , Luniewski assigned his rights in the inventions to Shamrock . Patent applications were filed on May 3 , 1982 and July 22 , 1983 . Having signed declarations to be filed with the patent applications , Luniewski left Shamrock in July 1983 and joined MSI as Vice President in charge of Operations . Thereafter , MSI began radiation processing of PTFE ; first by an `` original process '' , and , after this suit was commenced , by a `` current process '' .1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On May 31 , 1988 and October 11 , 1988 , respectively , the applications issued as United States Patent Nos . 4,748,005 ( '005 ) ( apparatus ) and 4,777,192 ( '192 ) ( method ) . On May 31 , 1988 Shamrock sued MSI and Luniewski for infringement of its '005 patent . MSI and Luniewski counterclaimed for a declaration of invalidity . In an October 13 , 1988 `` Memorandum of Decision and Order '' , the district court applied the doctrine of assignor estoppel and granted Shamrock 's partial summary judgment motion to strike affirmative defenses and to dismiss the counterclaim . The district court rejected the arguments that the assignment was fraudulently obtained and that privity was lacking between Luniewski and MSI.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On November 18 , 1988 , Shamrock amended its complaint , asserting infringement of the '192 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In an August 8 , 1989 `` Memorandum of Decision and Order '' , the district court rejected a request to withdraw the October 13 , 1988 order and entered summary judgment that : ( 1 ) the affirmative defenses and counterclaim relating to invalidity of the '192 patent were barred by assignor estoppel ; ( 2 ) the defense of unenforceability of both patents was barred by assignor estoppel ; and ( 3 ) the accused original and current processes infringed the patents . On August 24 , 1989 , the district court entered a `` Final Partial Judgment '' pursuant to Rule 54 ( b ) , Fed.R.Civ.P.,3 holding the patents not invalid , enforceable , and infringed *791 and enjoining MSI and Luniewski from further infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ISSUES _NEWLINE_ 1 . Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment of infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Whether the district court erred in holding that assignor estoppel precluded the invalidity and unenforceability defenses . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ OPINION _NEWLINE_ Summary judgment is appropriate where `` there is no genuine issue as to any material fact '' and `` the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law . '' Fed.R.Civ.P . 56 ( c ) ; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317 , 322-23 , 106 S.Ct . 2548 , 2552 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 ( 1986 ) . The facts are undisputed , and we have been shown no error in the district court 's application of the law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Infringement _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . The Claimed Inventions _NEWLINE_ The '005 patent is directed to an apparatus for processing high molecular weight , flowable solid polytetrafluoroethylene . Claim 1 is representative:4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apparatus for batch radiation processing of a high molecular weight , flowable solid polytetrafluoroethylene material to degrade said material to lower its molecular weight and render it grindable into a powder , comprising a processing vessel for holding a batch of said material during processing , a source of particle radiation for supplying radiation to a selected region of said processing vessel , mechanical stirring means for agitating said material in said processing vessel during said processing thereby to repeatedly move said material into and out of said selected region whereby said material is uniformly irradiated , and water cooling means for maintaining said vessel and said material below a selected temperature during said processing . _NEWLINE_ The '192 patent resulted from a continuation-in-part of the application that resulted in the '005 patent and is directed to a method for processing PTFE . Claim 1 is representative : _NEWLINE_ A method for processing flowable solid polytetrafluoroethylene material by radiation , to degrade said material to lower its molecular weight and render it grindable into a powder , comprising _NEWLINE_ ( a ) supplying said material to a processing vessel , _NEWLINE_ ( b ) supplying radiation to a selected region of said processing vessel , _NEWLINE_ ( c ) agitating said material in said processing vessel during said processing thereby to repeatedly move said material into and out of said selected region whereby said material is uniformly irradiated , and , _NEWLINE_ ( d ) cooling said material to maintain a temperature below 500¢X F. during said processing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . The Accused Processes _NEWLINE_ Appellants admitted that their original process involved a processing vessel for holding PTFE during processing , a source of particle radiation for supplying radiation to a portion of said vessel , mechanical stirring means for agitating the PTFE in the vessel during processing in such manner that the PTFE repeatedly moves into and out of the region being irradiated , and injection of water into the PTFE to cool it during processing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The current process differs from the original in that agitation is achieved with air pressure and paddles , air cooling has replaced water cooling , and an air classifier extracts particles of PTFE from the vessel . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 . The Disputed Claim Limitations _NEWLINE_ Appellants focus on four claim limitations and their use of a prior art step , but fail to establish the presence of genuine issues of material fact . Though the district court said both patents are infringed *792 by both processes , it is sufficient to note the correctness of its judgment based on infringement of the '005 patent by the original process and infringement of the '192 patent by the current process . See Fromson v. Advance Offset Plate , Inc. , 755 F.2d 1549 , 1556 , 225 USPQ 26 , 31 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( we review judgments not opinions ) ; Lee v. United States , 809 F.2d 1406 , 1408 ( 9th Cir.1987 ) , cert . denied sub nom . Lee v. Eklutna , 484 U.S. 1041 , 108 S.Ct . 772 , 98 L.Ed.2d 859 ( 1988 ) ( judgment may be affirmed on `` any ground fairly supported by the record '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( a ) `` Uniformly irradiated '' _NEWLINE_ The district court correctly looked to the specifications and prosecution histories of the patents to illuminate the meaning of `` uniformly irradiated '' . Loctite Corp. v. Ultraseal Ltd. , 781 F.2d 861 , 867 , 228 USPQ 90 , 93 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . The specifications point out that the prior art irradiated trays of PTFE on a conveyor belt , with upper layers of PTFE receiving more irradiation than lower layers . Hence the district court did not err in determining that `` uniformly irradiated '' refers to `` more consistent exposure '' of PTFE to radiation as contrasted with the `` uneven irradiation '' provided by the prior art . Appellants ' argument that some of their PTFE granules melt and some are removed by an air classifier may at most indicate that they may not achieve perfect uniformity of radiation , but the district court correctly determined that the claim does not require absolute uniformity . Inefficient infringement is infringement still . Laitram Corp. v. Cambridge Wire Cloth Co. , 863 F.2d 855 , 859 , 9 USPQ2d 1289 , 1294 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . The accused processes clearly fall within the scope of the `` uniformly irradiated '' limitation properly construed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( b ) `` Into and out of '' _NEWLINE_ Appellants ' argument that because the current process uses paddles and air pressure to agitate PTFE it does not meet this limitation was correctly rejected by district court as `` meritless '' . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( c ) `` Water cooling means for maintaining said vessel and [ the PTFE ] below a selected temperature during processing '' _NEWLINE_ Appellants say their spraying of water directly on the PTFE in the original process avoids this limitation because the '005 specification discloses a water jacket precluding contact between the water and the PTFE . The record , however , supplies no basis for reading the claim as limited to a water jacket or as precluding direct spraying of the PTFE . See E.I . DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co. , 849 F.2d 1430 , 1433 , 7 USPQ2d 1129 , 1131 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ; Loctite , 781 F.2d at 867 , 228 USPQ at 93 ( `` [ g ] enerally , particular limitations or embodiments appearing in the specification will not be read into the claims. '' ) . Moreover , appellants admit that their vessel is `` cooler than it would otherwise be without the addition of water [ by spraying ] . `` 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( d ) `` PTFE temperature below 500¢X F. '' _NEWLINE_ Appellants say there is no evidence that their current process meets this limitation . We fully agree with the district court 's analysis : _NEWLINE_ [ appellants ] do not assert that their processes involve temperatures above 500¢X F. , but merely that the temperature is below 620¢X . Although [ appellants ] are correct in asserting that on a motion for summary judgment all inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmovant , it has been held that : _NEWLINE_ the nonmovant must do more than merely present some evidence on an issue it asserts is disputed . Sufficient evidence for a jury to return a verdict in favor of the nonmovant must be forthcoming . _NEWLINE_ A.B . Chance Co. v. RTE Co. [ Corp. ] , 854 F.2d 1307 , 1311 [ , 7 USPQ2d 1881 , 1884 ] ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( citing *793 Avia [ Group Int ' l , Inc. v. L.A. Gear California , Inc. , 853 F.2d 1557 , 1560 , 7 USPQ2d 1548 , 1550 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ] ) . Here , not only have [ appellants ] failed to offer any evidence on the issue of temperature , but there is no indication that any such evidence is forthcoming . Therefore , the suggestion that there may exist a difference in temperature between the patent claims and the processes used by [ appellants ] is not a genuine issue that would preclude a summary judgment of infringement . ( footnote omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( e ) Prior art step _NEWLINE_ The district court correctly noted that appellants ' use of the prior art step of grinding was incidental and insignificant . The argument that infringement is avoided by adding a prior art step is fallacious . No claim limitation precludes use of simultaneous grinding and irradiation , and no basis appears in the record for reading such a limitation into the claims . See E.I . DuPont de Nemours & Co. , 849 F.2d at 1433 , 7 USPQ2d at 1131 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B. Assignor Estoppel _NEWLINE_ In Diamond Scientific Co. v. Ambico , Inc. , 848 F.2d 1220 , 1224 , 6 USPQ2d 2028 , 2031 ( Fed.Cir . ) , cert . dismissed , 487 U.S. 1265 , 109 S.Ct . 28 , 101 L.Ed.2d 978 ( 1988 ) , we reaffirmed the doctrine of assignor estoppel which precludes a patent assignor and those in privity with the assignor from contending that the patent is a nullity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that applying assignor estoppel was error because : ( 1 ) MSI is not in privity with Luniewski , ( 2 ) Luniewski was misled and under duress when he signed the declarations , and ( 3 ) the inequitable conduct defense is not subject to assignor estoppel . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . Privity _NEWLINE_ Assignor estoppel is an equitable doctrine , id . at 1224 , 6 USPQ2d at 2030 , `` that is mainly concerned with the balance of the equities between the parties . '' Id . at 1225 , 6 USPQ2d at 2031 . Those in privity with the assignor partake of that balance ; hence , extension of the estoppel to those in privity is justified . See id . at 1224 , 6 USPQ2d at 2030 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ What constitutes `` privity '' varies , depending on the purpose for which privity is asserted . See American Mach . Co. v. Everedy Mach . Co. , 35 F.2d 526 , 528 , 3 USPQ 196 , 198 ( E.D.Pa.1929 ) ( distinguishing use of privity for estoppel from use of privity for imposition of personal liability ) ; National Cash Register Co. v. Remington Arms Co. , 283 Fed . 196 , 201 ( D.Del.1922 ) , aff 'd , 286 Fed . 367 ( 3d Cir.1923 ) ( distinguishing subordinate in privity with principal from the reverse ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Privity , like the doctrine of assignor estoppel itself , is determined upon a balance of the equities . If an inventor assigns his invention to his employer company A and leaves to join company B , whether company B is in privity and thus bound by the doctrine will depend on the equities dictated by the relationship between the inventor and company B in light of the act of infringement . The closer that relationship , the more the equities will favor applying the doctrine to company B . See , e.g. , Douglass v. United States Appliance Corp. , 177 F.2d 98 , 101 , 83 USPQ 41 , 42-43 ( 9th Cir.1949 ) ( no privity between assignor and remote successors in interest ) ; United States Appliance Corp. v. Beauty Shop Supply Co. , 121 F.2d 149 , 151 , 50 USPQ 40 , 42-43 ( 9th Cir . ) , cert . denied , 314 U.S. 680 , 62 S.Ct . 180 , 86 L.Ed . 544 ( 1941 ) ( privity between assignor and co-developer of infringing device with company they formed to advance their interests in infringing device ) ; Stubnitz-Greene Spring Corp. v. Fort Pitt Bedding Co. , 110 F.2d 192 , 195 , 45 USPQ 52 , 55 ( 6th Cir.1940 ) ( privity between assignor and company of which he was principal stockholder , president , and general manager ) ; Buckingham Prods . Co. v. McAleer Mfg . Co. , 108 F.2d 192 , 195 , 44 USPQ 91 , 95 ( 6th Cir.1939 ) ( privity between assignor and corporation over which he had control of policy but lacked voting control ) ; Frick Co. v. Lindsay , 27 F.2d 59 , 61 ( 4th Cir.1928 ) ( wife in privity with husband/partner in business infringing patent ) ; Mellor v. Carroll , 141 F. 992 , 993-94 ( C.C.D.Mass.1905 ) ( privity *794 between assignor and others who availed themselves of assignor 's knowledge and assistance to conduct infringement ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court correctly determined that , considering the balance of equities and the relationship of Luniewski and MSI , no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding privity in this case . The undisputed facts are : ( 1 ) in July 1983 Luniewski left Shamrock to join MSI as Vice-President in charge of Operations ; ( 2 ) Luniewski owns 50,000 shares of MSI stock ; ( 3 ) MSI was formed in 1982 to sterilize surgical instruments and manufacture other medical goods ; yet as soon as Luniewski was hired in 1983 , MSI built facilities for processing PTFE with radiation ; ( 4 ) Luniewski oversaw the design and construction of those facilities ; ( 5 ) Luniewski was hired in part to start up MSI 's infringing operations ; ( 6 ) the decision to begin processing PTFE with radiation was made jointly by Luniewski and the president of MSI ; ( 7 ) MSI began manufacturing PTFE with radiation in 1985 ; and ( 8 ) Luniewski was in charge of MSI 's PTFE operation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ MSI attempts to distinguish Diamond Scientific , citing National Cash Register Co. v. Remington Arms Co. , 283 F. 196 , 202 ( D.Del.1922 ) , aff 'd , 286 F. 367 ( 3d Cir.1923 ) , and Babcock & Wilcox Co. v. Toledo Boiler Works Co. , 170 F. 81 , 85 ( 6th Cir.1909 ) , for the proposition that there is no privity between a corporation and a mere employee thereof . However , as above indicated , Luniewski was far more than a mere employee of MSI and the undisputed facts establish MSI 's direct involvement of Luniewski in MSI 's infringing operations . MSI clearly availed itself of Luniewski 's `` knowledge and assistance '' to conduct infringement . Mellor , 141 F. at 994 . The district court committed no error in finding MSI in privity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Alleged Misrepresentations and Duress _NEWLINE_ Appellants say there were questions of fact on whether Luniewski was misled on inventorship and patentability and signed the declaration under intimidation and duress . See Diamond Scientific , 848 F.2d at 1228 , 6 USPQ2d at 2034 ( Newman , J. , concurring ) ( assignor may still raise `` usual defenses to contract of assignment '' ) . More specifically , appellants argue that co-inventor Neuberg made no contribution to the inventions , that prior work at High Voltage Engineering known to Shamrock was a statutory bar and raised the possibility of inequitable conduct , and that Luniewski feared losing his job and bonus if he did not sign the declarations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It suffices to say here that we agree with the district court 's determination that no genuine issue of material fact as to misrepresentation or duress exists . Whether Luniewski was misled on inventorship and patentability is a question relating to the viability of the patent application , not to the validity of the assignment agreement . Hence it is not among the `` usual defenses to the contract of assignment '' . As discussed more fully below , the inequitable conduct defense is unfounded on its face . Employment , salary and bonuses are valid consideration for the assignment , see id . at 1225 , 6 USPQ2d at 2031 , and to hold that fear of their loss constitutes duress or intimidation would undermine every assignment by an employee-inventor . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 . Inequitable Conduct _NEWLINE_ Appellants argue that Diamond Scientific dealt with a challenge to patent validity but is silent on the equitable defense of inequitable conduct . We reject the contention that mere classification of a defense as equitable bars consideration of assignor estoppel . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is at best incongruous to suppose that the equitable doctrine of assignor estoppel can never be applied to an equitable defense . The premise of the doctrine , prevention of unfairness and injustice , is not removed upon the mere denomination of a defense as `` equitable '' . Diamond Scientific , 848 F.2d at 1224 , 6 USPQ2d at 2031 ( `` Courts that have expressed the estoppel doctrine in terms of unfairness and injustice have reasoned that an assignor should not be permitted to sell something and later to assert that what was sold is worthless , *795 all to the detriment of the assignee. '' ) . If we were to hold otherwise , Diamond Scientific could be avoided by merely couching invalidity defenses in terms of inequitable conduct , precisely as appellants attempt here to do . See Tenneco Resins , Inc. v. Reeves Bros. , Inc. , 736 F.2d 1508 , 1512 , 222 USPQ 276 , 279 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( `` While the affirmative defenses of invalidity and unenforceability against an asserted patent are technically separate and distinct , realistically they involve related if not identical evidence [ and are ] 'hopelessly intermingled ' with remaining issues. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants say the spectre of inequitable conduct is raised by its allegations that Neuberg was misnamed as joint inventor , and that Luniewski was misled about the prior work at High Voltage Engineering and the patentability of the inventions . Appellants rely on conjecture . Moreover , the district court correctly determined that those allegations directly contradict statements made by Luniewski in his declarations , see , e.g. , Diamond Scientific , 848 F.2d at 1225 , 6 USPQ2d at 2031-32 , i.e . : ( 1 ) Luniewski 's declarations name Neuberg as a joint inventor ; ( 2 ) Luniewski admitted participation in and knowledge of the prior work at High Voltage Engineering in 1980 yet stated in his declaration that the invention was not `` in public use or [ on ] sale in the United States ... for more than one year prior to this application '' ; and ( 3 ) `` Luniewski participated in the patent application process , at least to the extent of reviewing and commenting on the disclosure portions of the application '' and the declarations stated under penalty of perjury that the `` APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR RADIATION PROCESSING OF MATERIALS which is described and claimed in the attached specification '' is the invention . Where , as here , mere allegations made in support of an inequitable conduct defense are directly contradicted by the assignor-inventor 's statements made in his declaration , they render the defense nonviable and the equitable doctrine of assignor estoppel bars its assertion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants also point to a statement in Shamrock 's board of patent appeals brief for the '192 patent that `` radiation penetrates for some distance into the mass of particles '' when in fact `` shallow depth of penetration is established by Figure 6 of the patents-in-suit . '' Appellants fail , however , to explain how the statement and the showing in Figure 6 could be shown to amount to withholding or concealment of material information with intent to deceive . See Kingsdown Medical Consultants Ltd. v. Hollister , Inc. , 863 F.2d 867 , 872 , 9 USPQ2d 1384 , 1389 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) , cert . denied , 490 U.S. 1067 , 109 S.Ct . 2068 , 104 L.Ed.2d 633 ( 1989 ) . The allegations of inequitable conduct based on the statement are as unfounded as those contradicted by Luniewski 's declarations and is equally incapable of avoiding the application of assignor estoppel . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Appellants say that events relating to invalidity ordinarily occur before the inventor signs the declaration when he is in position to know and control them , whereas acts constituting inequitable conduct ordinarily occur after the inventor signs the declaration . That the basis for a defense arises after the inventor has signed a declaration , however , is ordinarily irrelevant , the inventor having assigned the rights to his invention , not alone to a patent application . As we said in Diamond Scientific , 848 F.2d at 1226 , 6 USPQ2d at 2032 : _NEWLINE_ It is also irrelevant that , at the time of the assignment , [ the inventor 's ] patent applications were still pending and the Patent Office had not yet granted the patent . What [ the inventor ] assigned were the rights to his inventions . That Diamond may have later amended the claims in the application process ( a very common occurrence in patent prosecutions ) , with or without [ the inventor 's ] assistance , does not give appellants ' argument against estoppel any greater force . Our concern must be the balance of the equities . _NEWLINE_ It is true that in a proper case general principles of equity may preclude use of assignor estoppel to bar a viable equitable defense arising from post-assignment events . See Buckingham Prods. , 108 F.2d at 195 , 44 USPQ at 95 ( inequitable conduct may defeat invocation of assignor estoppel *796 because `` one may not profit from his own fraud '' ) ; see also Westinghouse Elec . & Mfg . Co. v. Formica Insulation Co. , 266 U.S. 342 , 352-53 , 45 S.Ct . 117 , 120-21 , 69 L.Ed . 316 ( 1924 ) ( timing of assignment may affect scope of resulting estoppel ) . This is not such a case . Of the events involved in the four allegations made here , only the statement in the appeal brief occurred after Luniewski signed the declarations and , as above indicated , that allegation of inequitable conduct has no basis in law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The district court 's grant of summary judgment holding the '005 and '192 patents not invalid , enforceable , and infringed , and enjoining appellants from further infringement , is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 903 F.2d 789 , 14 U.S.P.Q.2d 1728 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the briefs , the parties use `` modified '' to refer to what the district court termed the `` current '' process .

Microsoft Corp. , No . 06-cv-142 , 2006 WL 2401099 ( E.D.Tex . Aug. 18 , 2006 ) . The district court denied Microsoft 's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) following a jury trial in which the jury found that Microsoft had infringed z4 Technologies , Inc. 's ( `` z4 's '' ) U.S . Patents No . 6,044,471 ( `` the ¡¬471 patent '' ) and No . 6,785,825 ( `` the ¡¬825 patent '' ) and had failed to prove these patents invalid . z4 Techs. , Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. , No . 06-cv-142 , 2006 WL 2401099 ( E.D.Tex . Aug. 18 , 2006 ) ( `` JMOL Opinion `` ) . Because substantial evidence supports the jury 's verdict , and because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Microsoft 's motion for a new trial , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ z4 is the assignee of two patents related to the prevention of software piracy . The inventor of these patents , David Colvin ( `` Colvin '' ) , founded and owns z4 . The ¡¬825 patent claims priority to the ¡¬471 patent through continuation applications , and thus shares an effective filing date of June 4 , 1998 . Because these patents also share a common specification , we will refer generically to `` the specification '' in reference to both the ¡¬471 and ¡¬825 patents . These patents are directed specifically to the problem of `` illicit copying and unauthorized use '' of computer software . ¡¬825 patent col.1 ll.21-25 . The patent specification explains that `` [ t ] he advent of the Internet has contributed to the proliferation of pirated software , known as 'warez ' , which is easily located and readily downloaded . '' Id . col.1 ll.33-35 . Prior art solutions to this problem were either easily circumvented or imposed substantial burdens on the consumer . For example , requiring the entry of a serial number was `` easily defeated by transferring the serial number ... to one or more unauthorized users . '' Id . col.1 ll.45-51 . Similarly , the use of `` hardware keys , '' which must be physically present to enable the software , proved `` relatively expensive for the developer and cumbersome for the authorized user . '' Id . col.1 ll.36-44 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ z4 's invention `` controls the number of copies of authorized software by monitoring registration information , '' and by `` [ r ] equiring authorized users to periodically update a password or authorization code provided by a password administrator . '' ¡¬471 patent col.3 ll.15-24 . More particularly , the patents disclose a multi-step user authorization scheme whereby an initial password or authorization code grants the user a `` grace period '' for a fixed number of uses or period of time . Users must then submit registration information to a representative of the software developer to receive a second password or authorization code , which is required to enable the product for use beyond this grace period . In the patented system , users are able to choose between a manual registration mode and an automatic or electronic registration mode . Upon receipt of the registration information , the software representative compares the submitted information to previously-stored registration information , and determines whether the user is authorized . If the user is not authorized , the software representative may disable the software . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On September 22 , 2004 , z4 sued Microsoft and Autodesk , Inc. ( `` Autodesk '' ) 1 alleging infringement of claim 32 of the ¡¬471 patent and claims 44 and 131 of the ¡¬825 patent . Claim 32 of the ¡¬471 patent reads *1345 as follows , with disputed portions highlighted : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 32 . A computer readable storage medium having data stored therein representing software executable by a computer , the software including instructions to reduce use of the software by unauthorized users , the storage medium comprising : _NEWLINE_ instructions for requiring a password associated with the software ; _NEWLINE_ instructions for enabling the software after the password has been communicated to the software ; _NEWLINE_ instructions for subsequently requiring a new password to be communicated to the software for continued operation of the software ; and instructions for automatically contacting an authorized representative of the software to communicate registration information and obtaining authorization for continued operation of the software . _NEWLINE_ Claims 44 and 131 of the ¡¬825 patent are identical for purposes of this appeal . They differ only in their definition of the `` initial authorization period , '' or grace period . Claim 44 reads as follows , with disputed portions highlighted : _NEWLINE_ 44 . A method for reducing unauthorized software use , the method comprising : _NEWLINE_ providing a representative to monitor software license compliance ; _NEWLINE_ associating a first authorization code with the software , the first authorization code enabling the software on a computer for use by a user for an initial authorization period , the initial authorization period being based on usage of the software ; _NEWLINE_ supplying the first authorization code with the software ; _NEWLINE_ requiring the user to enter the first authorization code to at least partially enable the software on the computer for use by the user during the initial authorization period ; _NEWLINE_ requiring the user to contact the representative for retrieval of at least one additional authorization code to repeat the enablement of the software on the computer for use by the user during a subsequent authorization period beyond the initial authorization period and allowing the repeat of the enablement of the software to be performed prior to the expiration of the initial authorization period so the enablement of the software can be continuous from the initial authorization period to the subsequent authorization period , the software being enabled on the computer for use by the user during the subsequent authorization period beyond the initial authorization period requiring without further communication with the representative following entry of the at least one additional authorization code ; _NEWLINE_ requiring the user to selectively choose either manual or electronic registration and provide registration information to the representative prior to retrieval of the at least one additional authorization code , the registration information including computer specific information ; comparing previously stored registration information related to at least one of the software , the user , and the computer with the registration information provided by the user to the representative to determine if the user is an authorized or an unauthorized user ; and _NEWLINE_ at least partially disabling , the software if the user [ sic ] an unauthorized user . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the litigation , z4 alleged that Microsoft 's `` Product Activation '' feature , as implemented in its `` Office '' group of software applications and its `` Windows '' operating system , infringed each of the asserted claims , beginning in 2000 and 2001 , respectively . Microsoft countered that it did not *1346 infringe z4 's patents , that the ¡¬471 and ¡¬825 patents were invalid for anticipation and obviousness , and that both patents were unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by Colvin . In particular , Microsoft contended that it had developed its own technology to reduce software piracy , called the Licensing Verification Program ( `` LVP '' ) , which it implemented in its 1998 Brazilian Publisher ( `` BP 98 '' ) software product . Because this product was released prior to the filing date of z4 's patents , Microsoft alleged that it constituted a prior invention sufficient to invalidate the asserted claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A magistrate judge held a Markman hearing , and subsequently construed several disputed claim terms . z4 Techs. , Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. , No . 06-cv-142 , 2005 WL 2304993 ( E.D.Tex . Sep. 20 , 2005 ) ( `` Claim Construction Opinion `` ) . Later , during the course of the jury trial , the court construed an additional term , `` user , '' which had become central to Microsoft 's litigation arguments . z4 Techs. , Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. , No . 06-cv-142 ( E.D.Tex . Apr . 12 , 2006 ) ( `` Supplemental Claim Construction Opinion `` ) . The jury returned a verdict of willful infringement of all three asserted claims against Microsoft and awarded damages of $ 115 million . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following the jury verdict , Microsoft filed various renewed motions for JMOL under Rule 50 ( b ) and a motion for a new trial under Rule 59 ( a ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . The district court denied all of Microsoft 's motions for JMOL and a new trial , thereby upholding the jury 's verdict in its entirety . The district court also held both patents to be enforceable . JMOL Opinion at 2 . It declined , however , to issue a permanent injunction against Microsoft . See z4 Techs. , Inc. v. Microsoft Corp. , 434 F.Supp.2d 437 ( E.D.Tex.2006 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Based on the jury 's finding of willful infringement , z4 requested enhanced damages . Although the district court chose not to enhance damages to the maximum of three times the jury verdict , it did award an additional $ 25 million against Microsoft . JMOL Opinion at 47 . It also awarded attorney 's fees to z4 based on the jury 's willfulness verdict and its own determination of litigation misconduct by Microsoft . Id . at 43 . Microsoft timely appealed . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Standard of Review _NEWLINE_ We review the denial of a motion for JMOL de novo , Harris Corp. v. Ericsson Inc. , 417 F.3d 1241 , 1248 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) , and thus affirm the jury 's verdict unless `` a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the [ winning ] party , '' Fed.R.Civ.P . 50 ( a ) ( 1 ) . `` The denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law ... is a procedural issue not unique to patent law , which we review under the law of the regional circuit where the appeal from the district court normally would lie . '' Riverwood Int ' l Corp. v. R.A. Jones & Co. , 324 F.3d 1346 , 1352 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . `` The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit describes appellate review of a JMOL denial as a determination whether 'the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court concludes that reasonable jurors could not arrive at a contrary verdict . ' `` Harris , 417 F.3d at 1248 ( quoting Bellows v. Amoco Oil Co. , 118 F.3d 268 , 273 ( 5th Cir.1997 ) ) . `` In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence ... we must affirm unless there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury 's verdict . In this regard , the evidence , as well as all reasonable inferences from it , are viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict . '' *1347 Lane v. R.A. Sims , Jr. , Inc. , 241 F.3d 439 , 445 ( 5th Cir.2001 ) ( internal citations omitted ) . In performing this review , we are mindful of the fact that `` [ a ] nticipation is a factual determination that is reviewed for substantial evidence when decided by a jury , '' Koito Mfg . Co. v. Turn-Key-Tech , LLC , 381 F.3d 1142 , 1149 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) , as is the jury 's determination of non-infringement , Acumed LLC v. Stryker Corp. , 483 F.3d 800 , 804 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We also review the denial of a motion for a new trial under regional circuit law , see Riverwood , 324 F.3d at 1352 , which , in the Fifth Circuit , provides for reversal only upon an `` abuse of discretion or a misapprehension of the law '' by the district court . Prytania Park Hotel , Ltd. v. Gen. Star Indem . Co. , 179 F.3d 169 , 173 ( 5th Cir.1999 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim construction is an issue of law , see Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc. , 52 F.3d 967 , 970-71 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( en banc ) , aff 'd , 517 U.S. 370 , 116 S.Ct . 1384 , 134 L.Ed.2d 577 ( 1996 ) , over which we exercise plenary review , Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs. , Inc. , 138 F.3d 1448 , 1456 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( en banc ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Analysis _NEWLINE_ Microsoft argues that the district court erred as a matter of law by denying JMOL of non-infringement based on three claim limitations allegedly lacking in the accused products and by denying JMOL of invalidity under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( g ) based on Microsoft 's BP 98 product . Microsoft also requests a new trial based on allegedly incorrect and prejudicial jury instructions . Microsoft further argues that the Supreme Court 's recent decision in Microsoft Corp. v. AT & T Corp. , 550 U.S. 437 , 127 S.Ct . 1746 , 167 L.Ed.2d 737 ( 2007 ) ( addressing infringement under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( f ) with respect to software components ) , compels a remand for a new trial on damages . We address each of these arguments in turn . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . Microsoft 's Motion for JMOL of Non-Infringement _NEWLINE_ Microsoft disputes the district court 's constructions of the `` user '' limitation of both patents , the `` automatically '' limitation of the ¡¬471 patent , and the `` electronic '' limitation of the ¡¬825 patent . It further challenges the jury 's finding that the accused products meet these limitations as well as the `` password '' limitation of the ¡¬471 patent and the `` authorization code '' limitation of the ¡¬825 patent . z4 responds that Microsoft 's accused products require the entry of a Product Key , which is a `` password '' or `` activation code , '' that they also allow users to choose Internet activation , which performs all the steps of the `` automatic '' or `` electronic '' claim limitations , and that because Microsoft 's Product Activation compares stored information regarding the software and the computer to registration information submitted by the user to activate the software , Microsoft infringes all of the asserted claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ a . The `` User '' Limitation _NEWLINE_ The district court construed the term `` user '' to mean `` a person , a person using a computer , a computer , or computers . '' Supplemental Claim Construction Opinion at 3 . Microsoft had attempted to limit `` users '' to `` persons , '' thereby excluding a computer or computers , while z4 advocated for the broad interpretation adopted by the district court . Id . at 1 . Under its definition , Microsoft argues that the asserted claims require the authorization of a `` particular user , regardless of what particular computer they are using , '' while the accused products authorize `` a particular computer , regardless of who is using it . '' Microsoft thus asserts that there can be no infringement because its products do not recognize `` unauthorized users , '' but rather unauthorized computers . In its reply brief , however , Microsoft concedes *1348 a construction of `` user '' as including both `` a person '' and `` a person using a computer . '' Reply Br . at 4 ( `` Properly construed , a 'user ' is a person or a person using a computer ... . It is only the district court 's elimination of the person altogether , in allowing a computer by itself to be a 'user , ' that we ask this Court to overrule as an error of law. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In construing a disputed claim term , we begin with the language of the claims . Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1312 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( en banc ) . Claims of the ¡¬825 patent include the limitations `` enabling the software on a computer for use by a user , '' and `` comparing previously stored registration information ... to at least one of the software , the user , and the computer . '' In these recitations , the `` user '' and the `` computer '' are distinct entities . To construe the term `` user '' to mean a `` computer '' would result in the claim being interpreted to recite , for example , `` enabling the software on a computer for use by a [ computer ] . '' The language of the claims does not reasonably or logically permit such a construction . Likewise , the written description makes clear that the terms `` users '' and `` computers '' are distinct and used to describe different things . E.g. , ¡¬471 patent col.1 ll.48-51 ( discussing `` users who may have a legitimate need to ... transfer a copy to a new computer '' ) ; id . col.7 ll.7-9 ( `` [ T ] he user installs ... the software in his computer or computer network. '' ) . Because a construction that would equate a `` user '' with a `` computer or computers '' conflicts with `` both the plain language of the claims and the teachings of the specification , '' NeoMagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems , Inc. , 287 F.3d 1062 , 1070 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) , the district court 's inclusion of `` computer or computers '' in its claim construction can not be sustained . Because we agree with Microsoft that the district court erred in construing `` user '' to include a computer or computers apart from a person , we modify the district court 's claim construction and hold that a `` user '' is properly construed as `` a person or a person using a computer . `` 2 This construction applies to all of the asserted claims . See Omega Eng ' g , Inc. , v. Raytek Corp. , 334 F.3d 1314 , 1334 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( `` [ W ] e presume , unless otherwise compelled , that the same claim term in the same patent or related patents carries the same construed meaning. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Notwithstanding our modification of the district court 's claim construction , however , we find Microsoft 's contention that the asserted claims require the authorization of a `` particular user , regardless of what particular computer they are using '' to be artificial and inconsequential . Although the claims recite `` software including instructions to reduce use of the software by unauthorized users , '' ¡¬471 patent claim 32 , and `` determin [ ing ] if the user is an authorized or an unauthorized user , '' ¡¬825 patent claims 44 , 131 , both the claims and specification describe methods of making this determination based on computer-specific information , among other things . This conclusion is based on relevant language that appears in the claims and not on any particular construction of the term `` user . '' Specifically , the claims recite that the software representative may identify authorized users based on a comparison of `` registration information provided by the user , '' with `` previously stored registration information related to at least one of the software , the user , and the computer . '' Id . *1349 Because the `` [ u ] se of the phrase 'at least one ' means that there could be only one or more than one '' of the listed types of previously stored registration information , Rhine v. Casio , Inc. , 183 F.3d 1342 , 1345 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) , the identification called for by the claims may be accomplished by comparing the registration information with previously-stored information related : ( a ) to the software installed by a person on the computer ; ( b ) to the person using the computer ; or ( c ) to the computer hardware . Microsoft 's argument that the asserted claims require the authorization of a `` particular user , regardless of what particular computer they are using '' ignores the language of the claims which , as noted above , permits the identification of authorized users based on , inter alia , `` previously stored registration information related [ only ] to ... the computer . '' Our construction of the term `` user '' to mean `` a person or a person using a computer '' does not foreclose or in any way affect such a conclusion nor does it preclude a determination that the accused Microsoft products infringe . Thus , Microsoft 's argument , while correct as to the construction of the claim term `` user , '' is not determinative of the question of infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to infringement , substantial evidence supports the jury verdict , even under our modified construction . Because the claims explicitly contemplate tracking authorized users through , inter alia , the identity of the computers on which they install the software as discussed , supra , and because Microsoft admits that it makes Product Activation determinations based on registration information related to user 's computers , see Reply Br . at 2 , a reasonable juror could find that Microsoft infringed the asserted claims notwithstanding our modification of the district court 's construction of the term user . See Teleflex , Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am . Corp. , 299 F.3d 1313 , 1328 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( noting that when we determine that the district court `` has misinterpreted a patent claim , we independently construe the claim to determine its correct meaning , '' and that `` [ w ] e may affirm the jury 's findings on infringement ... if substantial evidence appears in the record supporting the jury 's verdict and if correction of the errors in a jury instruction on claim construction would not have changed the result , given the evidence presented '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ b . The `` Password '' and `` Authorization Code '' Limitations _NEWLINE_ As discussed above , the patents disclose a system wherein an initial password or authorization code enables a software `` grace period '' for a fixed number of uses or period of time . Microsoft and z4 agree that the terms `` authorization code '' and `` password '' are used interchangeably . Claims 44 and 131 of the ¡¬825 patent recite `` associating a first authorization code with the software , the first authorization code enabling the software ... for an initial authorization period , ... supplying the first authorization code with the software ; [ and ] requiring the user to enter the first authorization code to [ activate the grace period ] '' ( emphases added ) . Similarly , claim 32 of the ¡¬ 471 patent recites `` requiring a password associated with the software ; ... [ and ] enabling the software after the password has been communicated to the software '' ( emphases added ) . The parties raise no claim construction issues related to these limitations , and we review them only for substantial evidence supporting the jury 's finding of infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although Microsoft admits that the accused products have a grace period , and that users are instructed to enter a `` Product Key '' provided with the software before this period may begin , it argues that this Product Key can not be an `` authorization code '' or `` password '' because it is not *1350 `` associated with the software '' as required by the claims . Specifically , Microsoft asserts that any Product Key can enable the grace period on any copy of the software , and thus there is no association between a particular copy of software and the specific Product Key provided with that copy . We disagree . Not only was the jury presented with evidence that Microsoft directly instructed its users to input a specific Product Key provided with each copy of the software and that the Product Key was required as part of product installation , but one of Microsoft 's own witnesses admitted that unless users enabled the grace period using this specific Product Key , they would have been unable to complete the Product Activation process ( i.e. , to enable the software beyond the grace period ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , substantial evidence supports a finding that in the ordinary course of activating a copy of the accused software , a user is required to enter an authorization code-the Product Key-associated with that copy of the software . Even if the potential use of unassociated Product Keys to enable software grace periods may be framed as a `` non-infringing mode [ ] of operation , '' our conclusion remains the same . See Hilgraeve Corp. v. Symantec Corp. , 265 F.3d 1336 , 1343 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( `` [ I ] n determining whether a product claim is infringed , we have held that an accused device may be found to infringe if it is reasonably capable of satisfying the claim limitations , even though it may also be capable of non-infringing modes of operation. '' ) . We are likewise unpersuaded by Microsoft 's related assertion that it does not infringe because a single copy of the accused software can be installed on an unlimited number of machines using a single Product Key . As with the previous argument , infringement is not avoided merely because a non-infringing mode of operation is possible . The fact remains that Microsoft 's Product Activation process prevents the use of software installations beyond the grace period unless the associated Product Key is used to enable the grace period . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Microsoft further argues that z4-through criticism of prior art in the patent specification-disclaimed the use of authorization codes that , like serial numbers in the prior art , can be used to install multiple copies of the software . It again contends that its own Product Key can not be considered an `` authorization code '' because a single Product Key can enable the grace period for any copy of the software . See Astrazeneca AB v. Mut . Pharm . Co. , 384 F.3d 1333 , 1340 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( discussing disavowal of claim scope through criticism of other products in the general summary or description of the invention ) . We find this argument disingenuous at best because the patent language cited by Microsoft distinguishes prior art systems relying on a single authorization code , such as a serial number , from the disclosed invention , which utilizes a dual authorization code scheme . It is undisputed that Microsoft 's Product Activation , like the claimed invention , requires dual authorization codes and that the Product Key enables only a limited grace period . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For all of these reasons , we affirm the jury 's verdict of infringement as to these limitations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ c. The `` Automatic '' and `` Electronic '' Limitations _NEWLINE_ The parties also dispute the level of user interaction required by the claims to complete the registration step and to enable the software beyond the grace period previously enabled by the initial authorization code . This dispute implicates two related limitations recited in the asserted claims . Claims 44 and 131 of the ¡¬471 patent recite `` requiring the user to selectively choose either manual or electronic *1351 registration '' ( emphasis added ) , while claim 32 of the ¡¬825 patent recites `` instructions for automatically contacting an authorized representative ... to communicate registration information and obtaining authorization for continued operation '' ( emphasis added ) . Despite the difference in the language of the claims , the parties agree that for purposes of this appeal , the terms `` automatic '' and `` electronic '' may be analyzed together . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the district court , Microsoft suggested a construction of the term `` automatically '' to be `` without user discretion or intervention . '' The district court disagreed and instead construed the term to mean `` instructions ( i.e . a computer code ) that enable a user 's computer to contact an authorized representative of the software . '' Claim Construction Opinion at 6-8 . The court did not construe the term `` electronic , '' but noted that `` [ i ] n open court , the parties agreed to use the claim language for this term . '' Id . at 8 . Microsoft further agreed that it would not argue at trial `` that 'electronic ' means 'without user intervention ' without leave of Court . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Microsoft contends that once users choose the electronic or automatic registration mode ( as contrasted with the manual mode ) , the initiation of the registration communication must commence without any user interaction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We find Microsoft 's claim construction arguments to be without merit . As the district court carefully observed , the claims are silent as to the initiation of the registration process , although the claims and specification `` clearly contemplate [ ] a user choice as to whether registration will be automatic or manual . '' Id . at 6 ( citing ¡¬471 patent col.7 ll.7-18 ( `` The user is allowed to choose between automatic or manual registration . `` ) ) ; see also ¡¬ 825 patent claims 44 & 131 ( `` requiring the user to selectively choose either manual or electronic registration '' ) . Although the specification discloses that automatic registration is performed `` without user intervention , '' ¡¬471 patent col.4 ll.50-54 ( emphasis added ) , the claims require at least a minimal level of user interaction to select this registration mode . Indeed , nothing in the claims or specification precludes user interaction in the selection or initialization of the automatic registration . Thus , the district court correctly rejected Microsoft 's attempt to exclude any user interaction from the claims , and we affirm its construction of this term . Microsoft makes no effort to argue non-infringement under this construction , and its own product documentation , which was presented to the jury , characterizes the Internet option as `` automatically activating the [ accused product ] . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , even under Microsoft 's proposed construction , its sole non-infringement argument is artificial at best . Specifically , Microsoft argues that although the accused products allow users to choose between Internet ( i.e. , automatic or electronic ) or phone ( i.e. , manual ) activation , if the user chooses the Internet option , `` nothing happens after that manual choice until the user additionally manually presses the 'next ' button ... . '' Microsoft Br . at 23 . Thus , even under Microsoft 's construction , a reasonable juror could find that `` manually press [ ing ] the 'next ' button '' is merely part of the selection process . Therefore , we affirm the judgment of infringement with respect to these limitations as well . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Microsoft 's Motion for JMOL of Invalidity by Anticipation _NEWLINE_ Before the district court , Microsoft argued a number of points in support of its motion for JMOL of invalidity based on anticipation by its BP 98 product . The district court denied the motion based solely on its conclusion that in light of `` the evidence presented at trial , a reasonable *1352 jury could have concluded that BP 98 did not work for its intended purpose , to stop piracy . '' JMOL Opinion at 7 . On appeal , Microsoft repeats many of the arguments it raised before the district court . Because we agree with the district court 's determination on the point it considered and find it dispositive , we discuss only that point and need not and do not address Microsoft 's other contentions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Microsoft argues that the LVP feature of its BP 98 software product anticipates the asserted claims under section 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) . That section provides that a patent is invalid if `` before such person 's invention thereof , the invention was made in this country by another inventor ... . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( g ) ( 2 ) . `` This court has interpreted ¡± 102 ( g ) to provide that 'priority of invention goes to the first party to reduce an invention to practice unless the other party can show that it was the first to conceive the invention and that it exercised reasonable diligence in later reducing that invention to practice . ' `` Monsanto Co. v. Mycogen Plant Sci. , Inc. , 261 F.3d 1356 , 1362 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( quoting Mahurkar v. C.R . Bard , Inc. , 79 F.3d 1572 , 1577 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Microsoft bore the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that BP 98 constituted an actual reduction to practice of the invention claimed in z4 's patents . See , e.g. , SRAM Corp. v. AD-II Eng ' g , Inc. , 465 F.3d 1351 , 1357 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( `` Under the patent statutes , a patent enjoys a presumption of validity , see 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 , which can be overcome only through facts supported by clear and convincing evidence. '' ) . `` In order to establish an actual reduction to practice , the inventor must prove that : ( 1 ) he constructed an embodiment or performed a process that met all the limitations ... and ( 2 ) he determined that the invention would work for its intended purpose . '' Cooper v. Goldfarb , 154 F.3d 1321 , 1327 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . `` Testing is required to demonstrate reduction to practice in some instances because without such testing there can not be sufficient certainty that the invention will work for its intended purpose . '' Slip Track Sys. , Inc. v. Metal-Lite , Inc. , 304 F.3d 1256 , 1267 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . Because the necessity and sufficiency of such testing are factual issues , see id . at 1268 , substantial evidence in the record supporting a finding that Microsoft 's LVP software did not work for its intended purpose will suffice to support the jury 's verdict that z4 's patents are not invalid for anticipation , see Eli Lilly & Co. v. Aradigm Corp. , 376 F.3d 1352 , 1362 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( noting that when we review the denial of a post-verdict JMOL `` on a mixed question of law and fact ... we must sustain the jury 's conclusion unless the jury was not presented with substantial evidence to support any set of implicit findings sufficient under the law to arrive at its conclusion '' ) ; Taskett v. Dentlinger , 344 F.3d 1337 , 1339 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( noting that reduction to practice is a question of law predicated on subsidiary factual findings ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As an initial matter , Microsoft contends that the district court incorrectly defined the `` intended purpose '' of the invention as `` to stop piracy , '' and thus erred in holding that a prior invention must `` stop piracy '' to qualify as invalidating art under ¡± 102 ( g ) . See JMOL Opinion at 7 . We agree . z4 's patents do not disclose a method or apparatus to completely eliminate software piracy , and the claim language indicates that the purpose of the invention is merely the reduction , rather than the elimination , of such piracy . See ¡¬471 patent claim 32 ( claiming `` instructions to reduce use of the software by unauthorized users '' ( emphasis added ) ) ; ¡¬825 patent claims 44 & 131 ( claiming `` [ a ] method for reducing unauthorized software use '' ( emphasis added ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1353 We agree with z4 , however , that the record contains substantial evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the anti-piracy feature of BP 98 did not work even to reduce piracy . For example , a reasonable juror could have relied upon the internal Microsoft presentation of April 28 , 1998 , which indicated that `` effectiveness '' was not known , and that Microsoft `` [ could ] only measure [ effectiveness ] once enabled fully in a country w/ [ sic ] a real product . '' The testimony of Microsoft 's own witness , Mr. Hughes , indicates that the anti-piracy software found in the accused products was `` virtually a complete rewrite '' of the software in BP 98 . Additionally , an internal Microsoft e-mail dated November 18 , 1998-more than five months subsequent to z4 's filing date-indicated a problem with the LVP software and documented an instance of the `` same CD being installed in almost 40 different machines with different user names . '' It also noted that one user had registered 34 times , and others had registered more than 15 times . z4 's expert testified at trial that this e-mail `` affirm [ ed ] [ his ] opinion that Brazilian Publisher 98 is not prior art because there was no recognition or appreciation that it worked for its intended purpose . '' We also note that Microsoft failed to produce the document containing the e-mail until the day before the trial started , and then only because z4 uncovered it during a last-minute deposition , see JMOL Opinion at 40 , resulting in the district court sanctioning Microsoft by instructing the jury that _NEWLINE_ z4 has offered [ the document containing the e-mail ] into evidence to show that Brazilian Publisher 98 did not work for its intended purpose ... . You are instructed that Microsoft , although it had knowledge of this document , did not produce it to z4 as it was required to do under controlling discovery rules . You 're instructed that ... under the law and rules of this Court , that Microsoft improperly withheld this document and you may infer , although you are not required to do so , that Microsoft improperly withheld the document because it was harmful to the positions it has taken in this case . _NEWLINE_ Microsoft has not appealed this sanction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Collectively , this evidence comprises `` more than a mere scintilla '' and is `` such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion . '' Consol . Edison Co. v. NLRB , 305 U.S. 197 , 229 , 59 S.Ct . 206 , 83 L.Ed . 126 ( 1938 ) ( discussing substantial evidence review ) ; see also Teleflex , 299 F.3d at 1323-24 . Because substantial evidence supports the jury verdict , we affirm the district court 's denial of Microsoft 's motion for JMOL of invalidity by anticipation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 . Microsoft 's Request for a New Trial _NEWLINE_ Microsoft requests a remand for a new trial based on three allegedly erroneous jury instructions and an intervening change in law concerning infringement under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( f ) . We do not find these arguments persuasive . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ a . Jury Instructions _NEWLINE_ Under the law of the Fifth Circuit , two requirements must be met before a new trial will be granted based on an erroneous jury instruction : `` First , the challenger must demonstrate that the charge as a whole creates substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations . Second , even if the jury instructions were erroneous , we will not reverse if we determine , based upon the entire record , that the challenged instruction could not have affected the outcome of the case . '' Hartsell v. Doctor Pepper Bottling Co. , 207 F.3d 269 , 272 ( 5th Cir.2000 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1354 i . Jury Instruction Regarding `` Single Document '' Corroboration _NEWLINE_ The district court instructed the jury that `` [ a ] n inventor 's testimony of conception must be corroborated in a single document . '' It later conceded that this instruction was `` improper , '' but nonetheless held that it did not `` constitute harmful error under the circumstances '' because Microsoft never presented , much less relied , on the testimony of an individual inventor . Instead , Microsoft represented to the court that `` ' [ f ] or its ¡± 102 ( g ) defense , Microsoft did not need to name a particular person ... . Microsoft corporately both conceived and reduced to practice before Mr . Colvin . ' `` JMOL Opinion at 26 ( quoting Microsoft 's JMOL motion ) ( emphasis added ) . The district court expressed reservations concerning the propriety of asserting corporate conception , but it expressly declined to decide this issue , and simply held that because Microsoft admitted that it `` never presented oral testimony of an individual inventor who allegedly conceived the anti-piracy portion of BP 98 , '' this instruction was simply not relevant to the verdict . Id . at 27 & n. 10 . Because we agree that this instruction was not relevant , we need not and do not address the merits of Microsoft 's claims regarding corporate conception . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Microsoft now contends that the jury could have assumed that one of its witnesses , Mr. Hughes , was an inventor . This argument is not persuasive . Microsoft can not argue below that it did not and need not name an individual inventor , see id . at 26-27 , yet now assert that the jury would have concluded precisely the opposite . Therefore , as the district court correctly concluded , `` whether such testimony must be corroborated by a 'single document ' was not an issue in the case . '' Thus , `` the improper instruction could not create sufficient error to warrant a new trial on the issue of anticipation . '' Id . at 27-28 . Furthermore , this instruction `` could not have affected the outcome of the case , '' Hartsell , 207 F.3d at 272 , in light of the substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that Microsoft 's BP 98 was not a reduction to practice of the asserted claims as discussed supra . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ii . Jury Instruction Regarding Burden of Proof on Invalidity _NEWLINE_ Although the district court properly instructed the jury that Microsoft had the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence , see SRAM , 465 F.3d at 1357 , Microsoft contends that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to further instruct the jury that Microsoft 's `` burden is more easily carried when the references on which the assertion is based were not directly considered by the examiner during prosecution . '' We disagree . See Uniroyal , Inc. v. Rudkin-Wiley Corp. , 837 F.2d 1044 , 1050 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( `` The burden of proof is not reduced when prior art is presented to the court which was not considered by the PTO . `` ) ; Bio-Rad Labs. , Inc. v. Nicolet Instrument Corp. , 739 F.2d 604 , 615 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( `` The introduction of prior art not considered by the PTO does not change the burden of proof or the requirement that evidence establish the presumption-defeating facts clearly and convincingly . `` ) , abrogated on other grounds by Markman , 52 F.3d 967 . Despite Microsoft 's reliance on cases indicating that a party may more easily meet this clear and convincing evidence burden when the references at issue were not before the examiner , see , e.g. , Am . Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , Inc. , 725 F.2d 1350 , 1359-60 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) , it cites no authority compelling courts to provide such an instruction , and we agree with the district court that `` it might lead the jury to believe that the burden of proof is less than clear and convincing when prior art was not considered *1355 by the PTO . '' JMOL Opinion at 22 . Accordingly , we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to provide the jury with Microsoft 's requested instruction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ iii . Jury Instruction Regarding Obviousness _NEWLINE_ Microsoft also requests a remand in light of the Supreme Court 's decision in KSR Int ' l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) , based on the district court 's instruction to the jury that `` to find an asserted claim obvious , you must find that there was some teaching , suggestion or incentive to combine the items in the prior art into the particular claimed combination . '' z4 responds that Microsoft would not be entitled to a new trial regardless of the outcome in KSR3 because the only direct evidence of obviousness introduced by Microsoft was the conclusory testimony of its expert . See Upjohn Co. v. Mova Pharm . Corp. , 225 F.3d 1306 , 1311 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( noting that `` there must be factual support for an expert 's conclusory opinion '' ) ; see also JMOL Opinion at 10 ( noting that it was `` questionable whether Defendants even established a prima facie case of obviousness '' ) . Although Microsoft asserts that `` the jury certainly could have reached a conclusion of obviousness on this record , '' Reply Br . at 30 , it fails to identify specific evidence or arguments establishing even a prima facie case of obviousness under the factors outlined in Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) . Therefore , we find no abuse of discretion here by the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ b . Damages Based On Foreign Sales Under ¡± 271 ( f ) _NEWLINE_ Finally , Microsoft requests a remand for a new trial on damages in light of Microsoft v. AT & T , because the jury made its damages determination based on worldwide sales of the accused products . Although the Supreme Court issued the Microsoft v. AT & T opinion after the parties had filed their briefs in this case , Microsoft argues that it preserved its right to argue damages under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( f ) by moving in limine to exclude evidence of foreign sales of the accused products . See Micro Chem. , Inc. v. Lextron , Inc. , 317 F.3d 1387 , 1391 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( holding that under Rule 103 ( a ) of the Federal Rules of Evidence , once a court makes a definitive evidentiary ruling on the record , a party need not renew an objection to preserve appeal rights ) . z4 counters that Microsoft has no basis to argue damages based on global sales because it failed to renew its motion in limine on this issue , see Fed.R.Civ.P . 50 ( b ) ; Unitherm Food Sys. , Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich , Inc. , 546 U.S. 394 , 404 , 126 S.Ct . 980 , 163 L.Ed.2d 974 ( 2006 ) ( holding that `` a party is not entitled to pursue a new trial on appeal unless that party makes an appropriate postverdict motion in the district court '' ) , and because Microsoft failed to properly present the issue on appeal by mentioning it only in a footnote in its opening brief . See SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp. , 439 F.3d 1312 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( holding that arguments raised only in footnotes are not preserved ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We reject Microsoft 's request for a retrial on damages because we find no properly-defined ¡± 271 ( f ) issue in the record . While we question the merits of Microsoft 's reliance on its denied motion in limine to preserve this argument for appeal in light of the district court 's admonition that its `` rulings on the pre-trial motions in limine were not definitive rulings , '' JMOL Opinion at 17 ; Fed R. Evid . 103 ( a ) ( requiring a `` definitive ruling '' to preserve *1356 a claim of error for appeal without renewing an objection ) , we need not decide whether Microsoft properly preserved any ¡± 271 ( f ) arguments . This is because the jury did not and could not have relied on ¡± 271 ( f ) in determining its damages award . The complaint alleged infringement using only language from ¡± 271 ( a ) ( `` [ W ] hoever without authority makes , uses , offers to sell , or sells any patented invention , within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor , infringes the patent. '' ) . The jury instructions similarly only paralleled the language of ¡± 271 ( a ) : _NEWLINE_ Any person or business entity that , without the patent owner 's permission , makes , uses , offers for sale , or sells within the United States any product or method that is covered by at least one claim of a patent , before the patent expires , infringes the patent . _NEWLINE_ At oral argument , Microsoft asserted that Microsoft v. AT & T is relevant because this case involves accused products that were identical to those of the Microsoft v. AT & T case and distributed using the same `` golden master '' distribution system discussed in that opinion . See Oral Arg . at 36:05-36:46 , available at http : //www.cafc.uscourts.gov/ oralarguments/mp3/2006-1638.mp3 . While that may be true , the asserted claims in this case differ significantly from those at issue in Microsoft v. AT & T , and thus raise different infringement issues . Moreover , Microsoft points to nothing in the record to establish that z4 ever argued that Microsoft _NEWLINE_ supplie [ d ] or cause [ d ] to be supplied in or from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention , where such components are uncombined in whole or in part , in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States . _NEWLINE_ 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( f ) ( 1 ) . Because no ¡± 271 ( f ) issues were presented to the jury , and because the jury instructions communicated the requirements for finding infringement only under ¡± 271 ( a ) , we must assume that the jury properly confined its analysis and ultimate finding of liability to the instructions given under ¡± 271 ( a ) . See , e.g. , Shannon v. United States , 512 U.S. 573 , 585 , 114 S.Ct . 2419 , 129 L.Ed.2d 459 ( 1994 ) ( declining `` to depart from the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions '' ) . Without more , a damages award based in part on global sales does not necessarily implicate ¡± 271 ( f ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Microsoft may or may not have legitimate arguments regarding the propriety of considering specific foreign sales in a damages calculation for infringement under ¡± 271 ( a ) , but it raised no such arguments here . Additionally , we find no evidence in the record that Microsoft presented any evidence to the district court segregating domestic and foreign sales . Therefore , we find no merit in Microsoft 's request for a remand on these grounds . Because Microsoft failed to explain what ¡± 271 ( f ) issues it defined below , let alone preserved , we deny Microsoft 's request for a new trial on damages . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the above reasons , we conclude that the district court properly denied Microsoft 's motions for JMOL and a new trial , and thus its judgment is _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 507 F.3d 1340 , 85 U.S.P.Q.2d 1340 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Circuit Judge Gajarsa did not participate in the vote . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ** _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Honorable Elaine E.

Of counsel on the brief was C. Kevin Speirs . _NEWLINE_ Before MAYER , Chief Judge , MICHEL and RADER , Circuit Judges . _NEWLINE_ Opinion _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ RADER , Circuit Judge . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The United States District Court for the District of Wyoming determined that U.S. Patent No . 4,111,727 ( the Clay patent ) and its reissue , U.S. Patent No . RE 33,788 ( the reissue patent ) were invalid . Atlas Powder Company ( Atlas ) , a licensee under those patents , sued IRECO Incorporated ( IRECO ) for infringement of the Clay patent . Following two bench trials , the district court concluded that both the original Clay patent and the reissue patent were invalid as anticipated by either U.S. Patent No . 3,161,551 ( Egly ) or U.K. Patent No . 1,306,546 ( Butterworth ) . Because the district court correctly interpreted the claims and applied the law of anticipation , this court affirms the finding of invalidity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ The Clay patent and its reissue both claim explosive compositions . To detonate , *1344 explosives require both fuel and oxidizers . The oxidizer rapidly reacts with the fuel to produce expanding gases and heat - an explosion . Composite explosives mix various sources of fuel and oxygen . The most widely used and economical composite explosive is ammonium nitrate and fuel oil ( ANFO ) . ANFO explosives mix about 94 % by weight of ammonium nitrate ( AN ) , the oxidizer , with 6 % by weight of fuel oil ( FO ) . The AN may include porous prills , dense prills , Stengel flakes , or crystalline AN . ANFO explosives have two primary disadvantages . First , wet conditions dissolve the AN and make the explosive unusable in damp settings . Second , ANFO is a relatively weak explosive because interstitial air occupies considerable space in the mixture , thereby decreasing the amount of explosive material per unit of volume . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To address these shortcomings , explosive experts developed water-in-oil emulsions . These emulsions dissolved the oxidizer into water and then dispersed the solution in oil . Because oil surrounds the oxidizer , it is resistant to moisture , thus solving one of the problems with ANFO . Emulsions also increased the explosive 's bulk strength by increasing the density of explosive material in the mixture . Emulsions , however , also have a disadvantage . Emulsions will not detonate unless sensitized . Sensitivity of a blasting composition refers to the ease of igniting its explosion . Experts generally sensitize emulsions by using gassing agents or adding microballoons throughout the mixture . The gassing agents or microballoons provide tiny gas or air bubbles throughout the mixture . Upon detonation , the gas pockets compress and heat up , thereby igniting the fuel around them . In other words , the tiny gas or air bubbles act as `` hot spots '' to propagate the explosion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Clay patent and its reissue both claim composite explosives made from the combination of an ANFO blasting composition and an unsensitized water-in-oil emulsion . Both patents claim essentially the same blasting composition . Claim one of the reissue patent recites : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A blasting composition consisting essentially of 10 to 40 % by weight of a greasy water-in-oil emulsion and 60 to 90 % of a substantially undissolved particulate solid oxidizer salt constituent , wherein the emulsion comprises about 3 to 15 % by weight of water , about 2 to 15 % of oil , 70 to 90 % of powerful oxidizer salt comprising ammonium nitrate which may include other powerful oxidizer salts , wherein the solid constituent comprises ammonium nitrate and in which sufficient aeration is entrapped to enhance sensitivity to a substantial degree , and wherein the emulsion component is emulsified by inclusion of 0.1 to 5 % by weight , based on the total composition , of an [ oil-in-water ] water-in-oil emulsifier to hold the aqueous content in the disperse or internal phase . _NEWLINE_ ( Underline added . ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When this lawsuit began , Atlas was the exclusive licensee under the Clay patent in the continental U.S. and Hawaii . Atlas commenced this lawsuit against IRECO in 1986 , alleging infringement of the Clay patent . During the course of litigation , Dr. Robert Clay , the inventor , filed a reissue petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) . Atlas then moved to stay the litigation pending resolution of the reissue application . The district court denied that motion and conducted a first bench trial on the issues of validity and infringement of the Clay patent in October 1986 . Dr. Clay then requested suspension of prosecution of the reissue application by the PTO in February 1987 . After waiting several years for a decision from the district court , Dr. Clay requested that the PTO reinstate the reissue proceedings in 1990 . In January 1992 , the Clay reissue patent issued upon surrender of the original patent . Later that *1345 year , the district court rendered its findings and judgment regarding the validity and infringement of the Clay patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In its 1992 judgment , the district court found claims 1 , 2 , 3 , 10 , 12 , 13 , and 14 of the Clay patent invalid as anticipated by either one of two prior art references , Egly or Butterworth . Egly and Butterworth each disclose blasting compositions containing a water-in-oil emulsion and ANFO with ingredients identical to those of the Clay patents in overlapping amounts . The following chart illustrates the overlap between the explosive compositions disclosed in the prior art patents and the Clay reissue patent : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Clay _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Egly _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Butterworth _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Composition contents : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Water-in-oil Emulsion _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 10-40 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 20-67 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 30-50 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Solid Ammonium Nitrate _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 60-90 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 33-80 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 50-70 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Emulsion contents : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ammonium Nitrate _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 70-90 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 50-70 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 65-85 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Water _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 3-15 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 15-about 35 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 7-27 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Fuel Oil _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 2-15 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 5-about 20 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2-27 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Emulsifier _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 0.1-5 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 1-5 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 0.5-15 % _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The only element of the Clay patent claims which is arguably not present in the prior art compositions is `` sufficient aeration ... entrapped to enhance sensitivity to a substantial degree . '' The trial court determined that `` sufficient aeration '' was an inherent element in the prior art blasting compositions within the overlapping ranges . The district court also found that none of the accused products infringed any of the asserted claims . The 1992 judgment was not final , however , and specifically reserved a decision on the effect of the reissue patent for phase two of the case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On September 22 , 1993 , the district court granted Hanex Products Inc. 's ( Hanex ) motion to intervene in the lawsuit . Hanex owns the two patents and had licensed them to Atlas . Hanex asserted the same claim of patent infringement against IRECO that Atlas had asserted , but also initiated a declaratory judgment action against ICI Explosives USA , Inc. ( ICI ) , Atlas ' successor-in-interest , seeking the sole right to control the litigation . In July 1994 , the district court granted declaratory relief in favor of Hanex , against ICI , giving Hanex the sole right to control and direct the litigation on the two patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After the reissue patent issued , the district court conducted a second bench trial , in January 1996 , on the issues of phase two . Specifically , the district court considered whether reissue affected its 1992 judgment . On September 25 , 1998 , the district court rendered its final judgment finding claims 1 , 2 , 3 , 10 , 12 , 13 , and 14 of the Clay reissue patent invalid as anticipated and finding that IRECO had not infringed any of the asserted claims . Despite the PTO 's consideration of the Egly and Butterworth references during prosecution of the reissue , the district court concluded that IRECO had overcome the Clay reissue patent 's presumption of validity under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 ( 1994 ) by clear and convincing evidence . The district court noted that IRECO presented a great deal of testimonial and documentary evidence on inherent disclosures of the prior art that was not before the PTO in the *1346 reissue proceeding . Hanex appealed to this court from the 1998 final judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ This court reviews claim construction as a matter of law . See Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs. , Inc. , 138 F.3d 1448 , 1451 , 46 USPQ2d 1169 , 1173 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( en banc ) ; Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc. , 52 F.3d 967 , 979 , 34 USPQ2d 1321 , 1326 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( en banc ) . Anticipation is a question of fact , including whether or not an element is inherent in the prior art . See In re Schreiber , 128 F.3d 1473 , 1477 , 44 USPQ2d 1429 , 1431 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . Therefore , this court reviews a finding of anticipation under the clearly erroneous standard . See Gechter v. Davidson , 116 F.3d 1454 , 1457 , 43 USPQ2d 1030 , 1032 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` To anticipate a claim , a prior art reference must disclose every limitation of the claimed invention , either explicitly or inherently . '' In re Schreiber , 128 F.3d at 1477 . Anticipation of a patent claim requires a finding that the claim at issue `` reads on '' a prior art reference . See Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner , 778 F.2d 775 , 781 , 227 USPQ 773 , 778 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . In other words , if granting patent protection on the disputed claim would allow the patentee to exclude the public from practicing the prior art , then that claim is anticipated , regardless of whether it also covers subject matter not in the prior art . See id . at 781 . Specifically , when a patent claims a chemical composition in terms of ranges of elements , any single prior art reference that falls within each of the ranges anticipates the claim . See id . at 780-82 ( `` It is also an elementary principle of patent law that when , as by a recitation of ranges or otherwise , a claim covers several compositions , the claim is 'anticipated ' if one of them is in the prior art. '' ) . In chemical compounds , a single prior art species within the patent 's claimed genus reads on the generic claim and anticipates . See In re Gosteli , 872 F.2d 1008 , 1010 , 10 USPQ2d 1614 , 1616 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As noted previously , both Egly and Butterworth disclose blasting compositions with ingredients identical to those of the Clay patent and its reissue in overlapping amounts . The only element which is arguably missing from the prior art is the requirement that `` sufficient aeration [ be ] entrapped to enhance sensitivity to a substantial degree . '' To decide the issue of anticipation , therefore , the district court examined whether `` sufficient aeration ... to enhance sensitivity '' was inherently part of the prior art compositions . That decision , in turn , required the trial court to interpret the claim term `` sufficient aeration . '' By looking at the express language of the claims and the patent 's written description , the district court concluded that the claim term `` sufficient aeration '' included both interstitial air ( between oxidizer particles ) and porous air ( within the pores of oxidizer particles ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The first task of this court on appeal is to construe independently the disputed claim term . This question requires this court to determine whether the claim term `` sufficient aeration '' includes porous air , as the trial court determined . The claim term `` sufficient aeration '' does not limit the air content of the composition to interstitial air . Rather , the broad term `` aeration '' contains no qualitative limits on the kind of air exposure , only the quantitative limit that the air exposure be `` sufficient '' to enhance sensitivity . If the inventor intended `` sufficient aeration '' to carry qualitative limits , he also did not express that intention in the patent 's written description . The specification gives no explicit definition of the phrase `` sufficient aeration ... to enhance sensitivity , '' which appears in the patent for the first time in the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1347 It is , of course , possible that the inventor did not include qualitative limits on the term `` sufficient aeration '' in the specification because those of ordinary skill in the art understand that only interstitial air enhances sensitivity and satisfies the claim 's language . See Autogiro Co. of Am . v. U.S. , 181 Ct.Cl . 55 , 384 F.2d 391 , 397 , 155 USPQ 697 ( Ct.Cl.1967 ) ( `` Claims can not be clear and unambiguous on their face . `` ) ; Markman , 52 F.3d at 986 ( `` [ T ] he focus in construing disputed terms in claim language is ... on the objective test of what one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would have understood the term to mean. '' ) . The trial record , however , shows that those of ordinary skill in this art at the time the patent application was filed knew that both interstitial and porous air enhance sensitivity . Dr. Clay himself , the inventor of the patents in suit , testified that air from any source would contribute to the explosion of a heavy ANFO composition and , particularly , air trapped within the pores of porous prilled AN . Therefore , this court detects no error in the district court 's conclusion that `` sufficient aeration ... to enhance sensitivity '' is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to include both interstitial and porous air . The district court appropriately construed the claims at issue to include aeration from both sources . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ Based on its correct interpretation of `` sufficient aeration , '' the district court heard evidence on whether both interstitial and porous air were present and enhanced sensitivity in the prior art explosive compositions . Based on the evidence , the district court concluded that IRECO had shown the inherency of the disputed claim element in the prior art and overcome `` the presumption of validity under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 by providing clear and convincing evidence of invalidity . '' This court must determine whether the district court committed clear error by determining that the evidence clearly and convincingly established that `` sufficient aeration ... to enhance sensitivity '' was inherent in either Egly or Butterworth . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To invalidate a patent by anticipation , a prior art reference normally needs to disclose each and every limitation of the claim . See Standard Havens Prods. , Inc. v. Gencor Indus. , Inc. , 953 F.2d 1360 , 1369 , 21 USPQ2d 1321 , 1328 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . However , a prior art reference may anticipate when the claim limitation or limitations not expressly found in that reference are nonetheless inherent in it . See id . ; Verdegaal Bros. , Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal. , 814 F.2d 628 , 630 , 2 USPQ2d 1051 , 1053 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) . Under the principles of inherency , if the prior art necessarily functions in accordance with , or includes , the claimed limitations , it anticipates . See In re King , 801 F.2d 1324 , 1326 , 231 USPQ 136 , 138 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) . Inherency is not necessarily coterminous with the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art . See Titanium Metals , 778 F.2d at 780 . Artisans of ordinary skill may not recognize the inherent characteristics or functioning of the prior art . See id . at 782 . However , the discovery of a previously unappreciated property of a prior art composition , or of a scientific explanation for the prior art 's functioning , does not render the old composition patentably new to the discoverer . See id . at 782 ( `` Congress has not seen fit to permit the patenting of an old [ composition ] , known to others ... , by one who has discovered its ... useful properties . `` ) ; Verdegaal Bros. , 814 F.2d at 633 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court 's decision in Titanium Metals illustrates these principles . See Titanium Metals , 778 F.2d at 775 . In Titanium Metals , the patent applicants sought a patent for a titanium alloy containing various ranges of nickel , molybdenum , iron , and *1348 titanium . The claims also required that the alloy be `` characterized by good corrosion resistance in hot brine environments . '' Titanium Metals , 778 F.2d at 776 . A prior art reference disclosed a titanium alloy falling within the claimed ranges , but did not disclose any corrosion-resistant properties . This court affirmed a decision of the PTO Board of Appeals finding the claimed invention unpatentable as anticipated . This court concluded that the claimed alloy was not novel , noting that `` it is immaterial , on the issue of their novelty , what inherent properties the alloys have or whether these applicants discovered certain inherent properties . '' Id . at 782 . This same reasoning holds true when it is not a property , but an ingredient , which is inherently contained in the prior art . The public remains free to make , use , or sell prior art compositions or processes , regardless of whether or not they understand their complete makeup or the underlying scientific principles which allow them to operate . The doctrine of anticipation by inherency , among other doctrines , enforces that basic principle . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The trial record contains exhaustive evidence regarding the inherency of both interstitial and porous air in the Egly and Butterworth compositions within the overlapping ranges . The testimony from expert witnesses for both parties established that whether sufficient air is present in the explosive composition to facilitate detonation is a function of the ratio of the emulsion to the solid constituent . Dr. Clay testified that `` if you mix porous prills , for example , with 30 % typical water-in-oil emulsions , you 're going to have air in there and it will detonate . '' Another of Atlas ' experts testified that a mixture of 30 % of either an Egly or a Butterworth emulsion , mixed with 70 % standard fertilizer grade porous AN would have interstitial air , assuming nothing was done to disturb the size distribution of the AN prills . The other experts agreed that the emulsions described in both Egly and Butterworth would inevitably and inherently have interstitial air remaining in the mixture up to a ratio of approximately 40 % emulsion to 60 % solid constituent . The expert testimony supports the district court 's conclusion that `` sufficient aeration '' is inherent in both Egly and Butterworth . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also relied on evidence from several tests which showed that `` sufficient aeration ... to enhance sensitivity '' was inherently present within the overlapping ranges of the Clay patents and Egly and Butterworth . In tests conducted with porous prilled AN combined with FO , stable detonations were obtained in every 8 '' diameter bore hole test where the percentage of emulsion ranged from 30 % to 42.5 % . Butterworth specifically discloses the use of porous prilled AN . Butterworth , p. 3 , ll . 35-50 . These tests , therefore , support the finding that `` [ t ] he emulsions described by Butterworth , combined with the ratios of ANFO disclosed by Butterworth , would inevitably and inherently have interstitial air remaining up to approximately 40 % emulsion . '' The district court also found that the solid AN disclosed in Egly would have included porous prills . These tests , therefore , further support the court 's finding that `` emulsions described in the Egly Patent , combined with either AN or ANFO , would inevitably and inherently have interstitial air remaining in the mixture up to approximately 40 % emulsion to 60 % solid constituent . '' This court discerns no clear error in the district court 's conclusion that `` sufficient aeration '' was inherent in each anticipating prior art reference . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because `` sufficient aeration '' was inherent in the prior art , it is irrelevant that the prior art did not recognize the key aspect of Dr. Clay 's alleged invention - that air may act as the sole sensitizer of the explosive composition . An inherent structure , composition , or function is not *1349 necessarily known . See , e.g. , In re King , 801 F.2d at 1327 ; Titanium Metals , 778 F.2d at 782 . Once it is recognized that interstitial and porous air were inherent elements of the prior art compositions , the assertion that air may act as a sole sensitizer amounts to no more than a claim to the discovery of an inherent property of the prior art , not the addition of a novel element . Insufficient prior understanding of the inherent properties of a known composition does not defeat a finding of anticipation . See Titanium Metals , 778 F.2d at 782 . In addition , there was evidence that Butterworth did recognize the functioning of interstitial and porous air in sensitizing the composition . Butterworth recognizes the need for a gaseous sensitizer . Butterworth , p. 2 , ll . 38-56 . It teaches that the `` sensitizer may be a gaseous sensitizer present in the composition in the form of gas bubbles or discrete particles containing an entrapped gas such as air . '' Id. , p. 2 , ll . 41-45 . Although this typically suggests use of a gassing agent or microballoons , Butterworth expressly recognizes that in certain ranges ( i.e. , 50 % to 70 % by weight of ANFO ) the mixture of porous prilled AN and FO alone provides the necessary sensitization . See id. , p. 3 , ll . 37-50 . The district court found that Butterworth thus inherently appreciates that interstitial and porous air may serve as the necessary sensitizer . This court discerns no clear error in that finding . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In reaching this judgment , this court notes that Egly teaches away from air entrapment . Specifically , Egly teaches that it is desirable to `` fill all spaces in between each particle to give added density . '' Egly , col. 1 , ll . 26-27 . This statement in Egly , however , does not defeat the district court 's finding of anticipation for several reasons . First , Egly 's teaching does not in any way discredit the trial court 's alternative reliance on Butterworth for invalidation of the Clay patent and its reissue . More important , the statement in Egly is , in fact , only a showing that Egly did not recognize the function of the inherently present interstitial air . As noted previously , an insufficient scientific understanding does not defeat a showing of inherency . In fact , even in Egly itself , the only way taught for removing interstitial air is the addition of more emulsion . See id. , col. 1 , ll . 50-55 . Egly , however , teaches the use of a broad range - between 20 % and 67 % by weight - of water-in-oil emulsion . See id. , col. 3 , ll . 21-24 . While Egly compositions containing amounts approaching 67 % by weight of water-in-oil emulsions may have little or no entrapped air , the evidence established that at emulsion levels below 40 % , Egly compositions `` inevitably and inherently '' trap sufficient amounts of air to enhance sensitivity . This evidence included both substantial amounts of expert testimony and data showing extensive testing of Egly compositions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , although the record showed that special mixing techniques - such as grinding and screening the AN particles - remove interstitial air from the blasting compositions , Egly did not teach or suggest any such techniques . Thus , although Egly may have suggested removal of air , it nonetheless inherently contained interstitial aeration sufficient to enhance sensitivity when comprised of elements within the Clay patent ranges . Consequently , this court discerns no clear error in the district court 's conclusion that Egly compositions within the range of the Clay patent claims inherently contain sufficient air to enhance sensitivity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Based upon all the evidence , substantial amounts of which were not before the PTO in its reissue examination , the district court concluded that IRECO had proven _NEWLINE_ clearly and convincingly that , unless extraordinary measures are taken to grind and screen ammonium nitrate , the existence of `` interstitial air , '' or sufficient *1350 aeration to sustain a stable detonation , is a function of the ratios of emulsion to solid constituent . Specifically , at ratios of 30 % emulsion and 70 % solid constituent , which are common to the Clay Patent , the Egly Patent , and the Butterworth Patent , there is inherently sufficient aeration to sustain a stable detonation , barring extraordinary efforts to grind and screen the ammonium nitrate used in the solid constituent . _NEWLINE_ This court discerns no clear error in the district court 's factual determination that the prior art inherently possesses sufficient aeration to enhance sensitivity to a substantial degree within the overlapping ranges . Nor does this court discern clear error in the district court 's finding of anticipation based on either Egly or Butterworth . To uphold the Clay patent and its reissue would preclude the public from practicing the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ In conclusion , this court affirms the district court 's finding of invalidity with respect to claims 1 , 2 , 3 , 10 , 12 , 13 , and 14 of the Clay patent and the Clay reissue patent . This court therefore does not address the district court 's additional finding of non-infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ Each party shall bear its own costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 190 F.3d 1342 , 51 U.S.P.Q.2d 1943

( collectively `` Crown '' ) appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio following its granting of Ball Metal Beverage Container Corp. 's ( `` Ball 's '' ) motion for summary judgment invalidating the asserted claims of U.S. Patent Nos . 6,935,826 ( `` the ¡¬826 patent '' ) and 6,848,875 ( `` the ¡¬875 patent '' ) for violating the written description requirement and because the asserted claims were anticipated . Because the ¡¬826 and ¡¬875 patents ' common specification conveys to one of ordinary skill in the art that the patentee was in possession of the subject matter of the asserted claims , and because a material dispute remains as to what the prior art inherently discloses , we reverse and remand . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . The ¡¬826 and ¡¬875 Patents _NEWLINE_ Crown and Ball are both in the business of selling can ends and can bodies to fillers associated with major beverage companies . `` Can ends '' are essentially the lids affixed to the top of beverage cans , while `` can bodies '' are generally cylindrical hollow containers to which the can ends are attached for filling . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬826 and ¡¬875 patents share a common specification which identifies and discusses two ways to save metal when seaming can bodies and can ends . The specification teaches that `` improvements in metal usage can be made by increasing the slope of the chuck wall and limiting the width of the anti peaking bead . '' *1376 ¡¬826 patent col.1 ll.33-35.1 Both improvements result in significant metal savings without reducing the overall can diameter , meaning that the improvements could be run on existing machinery . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The specification first describes the invention of increasing the slope of the can end 's chuck wall ( also referred to as the `` can end wall '' ) . This new geometry is different from prior art Figure 2 , which shows a steep can end wall that has a relatively small angle C relative to the vertical axis : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ The specification teaches that angle C in prior art can end walls is `` between 12¢X and 20¢X to the vertical . '' Id . col.1 ll.21-55 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In contrast to the prior art , the specification describes a can end where the `` chuck wall is inclined to axis perpendicular to the exterior of the central panel at an angle between 30¢X and 60¢X '' and preferably `` between 40¢X and 45¢X . '' Id . col.2 ll.9-12 . The new geometry is illustrated in Figure 5 below : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ This change in geometry-increasing the size of angle C relative to the vertical axis to make the chuck wall less steep-reduces the use of metal in the manufacturing of the can end . Id . col.2 ll.1-12 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1377 The specification also teaches that metal can be saved by `` limiting the width of the anti peaking bead , '' preferably to a `` bead narrower than 1.5mm '' in radius . Id . col.1 ll.33-35 , col.2 ll.10-11 , col.4 l.19 . This anti peaking bead-also known as the reinforcing bead-is the U-shaped structure shown in prior art Figure 2 around the location labeled `` D. '' In connection therewith , the specification discusses a new seaming method employing a modified seaming chuck to avoid causing damage to the chuck or the reinforcing bead , damage which otherwise might result from the narrowing of the bead . An embodiment of the modified seaming chuck ( 30 ) is shown below in Figures 6 and 7 : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ In this embodiment , the can end is placed over a can body ( 12 ) . Seaming rollers ( 34 , 38 ) and modified chuck ( 30 ) are then applied . The modified chuck ( 30 ) has a frustoconical drive surface ( 32 ) which engages with the chuck wall ( 24 ) of the can end ( 22 ) . Id . col.4 ll.43-46 . During this seaming process , the `` upper portion '' of the chuck wall ( 24 ) is deformed so as to be bent upwardly around the chuck . Id . col.5 ll.7-12 . The left-hand side of Figure 6 shows the beginning of this deformation , and the right-hand side of Figure 7 shows the final deformation after seaming is complete . The upper portion of the chuck wall is bent upwardly so as to be substantially vertical after seaming . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the specification explains , this modified chuck ( 30 ) does not drive deeply into the anti peaking bead ( 25 ) . Id . col.4 ll.59-62 , col.4 l.65-col.5 l.3 . The specification teaches that a chuck with `` a narrow annular flange '' is `` more likely to fracture . '' Id . col.1 ll.65-67 , col.3 ll.46-47 . Moreover , *1378 there `` is a risk of scuffing if this annulus slips , '' which may leave `` unsightly black marks after pasteurization . '' Id . col.1 ll.65-66 , col.3 ll.49-50 . To avoid these problems , the modified chuck does not drive deeply into the reinforcing bead . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The parties agree that the specification teaches that `` improvements in metal usage can be made by increasing the slope of the chuck wall and limiting the width of the anti peaking bead . '' Id . col.1 ll.33-35 . However , the parties disagree as to whether the written description supports an invention that improves metal usage by increasing the slope of the chuck wall without a modified chuck that does not drive deeply into the reinforcing bead . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 14 is the one asserted claim of the ¡¬826 patent . All of the ¡¬826 product claims are directed to a can end before it is seamed to a can body . Claim 14 depends from claim 13 and recites a series of structural features . Both claims are set out below : _NEWLINE_ 13 . A metal can end for use in packaging beverages under pressure and adapted to be joined to a can body by a seaming process so as to form a double seam therewith using a rotatable chuck comprising first and second circumferentially extending walls , said first and second chuck walls forming a juncture therebetween , said can end comprising ; _NEWLINE_ a peripheral cover hook , said peripheral cover hook comprising a seaming panel adapted to be formed into a portion of said double seam during said seaming operation ; _NEWLINE_ a central panel ; _NEWLINE_ a wall extending inwardly and downwardly from said cover hook , a first portion of said wall extending from said cover hook to a first point on said wall , said first wall portion adapted to be deformed during said seaming operation so as to be bent upwardly around said juncture of said chuck walls at said first point on said wall , a second portion of said wall extending from said first point to a second point forming a lowermost end of said wall , a line extending between said first and second points being inclined to an axis perpendicular to said central panel at an angle of between 30¢X and 60¢X . _NEWLINE_ 14 . The end according to claim 13 , further comprising an annular reinforcing bead connected to said wall at said second point , said annular reinforcing bead connecting said wall to said central panel . _NEWLINE_ Id . col.10 ll.37-65 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claims 50 and 52 are the two asserted claims of the ¡¬875 patent . All of the ¡¬875 claims are directed to methods of seaming a can end . Claim 52 depends from claim 50 and both are reproduced below : _NEWLINE_ 50 . A method of forming a double seam between a can body and a can end intended for use in packaging a carbonated beverage , said method comprising the steps of : _NEWLINE_ a ) providing a can end having a circumferentially extending peripheral cover hook , said peripheral cover hook comprising a seaming panel to be formed into a portion of said double seam during a seaming operation , an annular reinforcing bead , and a circumferentially extending wall extending from said seaming panel to said reinforcing bead , said wall and said reinforcing bead forming a transition therebetween ; _NEWLINE_ b ) placing said cover hook of said can end into contact with a circumferentially extending flange of a can body ; _NEWLINE_ c ) providing a rotatable chuck comprising first and second circumferentially extending walls , said second chuck wall depending from said first *1379 chuck wall so as to form a juncture therebetween ; _NEWLINE_ d ) bringing said chuck into engagement with said can end ; and _NEWLINE_ e ) performing said seaming operation by placing one or more seaming rolls into contact with said peripheral cover hook of said can end while said can end rotates so as to deform said seaming panel of said cover hook and to bend a portion of said can end wall upwardly around said juncture of said chuck walls at a first location on said can end wall , a straight line extending from said first location on said can end wall to said transition between said can end wall and said reinforcing bead inclined between about 20¢X and about 60¢X with respect to said axial centerline both before and after said seaming operation . _NEWLINE_ 52 . The method according to claim 50 , wherein said line extending from said first location to said transition is inclined between about 30¢X and about 50¢X with respect to said axial centerline of said can end both before and after performing said seaming operation . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬875 patent col.15 ll.8-50 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . The District Court Proceedings _NEWLINE_ Crown filed suit against Ball in 2005 , shortly after the issuance of the ¡¬ 875 patent . When the ¡¬826 patent issued several months later , in August 2005 , Crown amended its complaint to include that patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court construed the disputed claim terms in April 2008 . On September 8 , 2009 , the district court granted Ball 's motion for summary judgment and denied Crown 's cross motion , holding that the asserted claims were invalid for violating the written description requirement . Crown Packaging Tech. , Inc. v. Ball Metal Beverage Container Corp. , 662 F.Supp.2d 939 ( S.D.Ohio 2009 ) . Specifically , the district court held that the asserted claims cover driving a chuck either inside or outside of the reinforcing bead , but the specification only supports driving a chuck outside of the can end 's reinforcing bead . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also held the asserted claims were invalid as anticipated by Japanese Patent Application No . 57-117323 by Toyo Seikan Kaisha , Ltd. ( `` Toyo '' ) .2 In so finding , the district court concluded that Ball had satisfied its burden by showing that at least one embodiment of Toyo anticipated the asserted claims . The district court held that the limitation of upward bending of a can end wall was inherently disclosed by combining the unseamed can end in Toyo 's claim 2 with the seamed can end in Toyo 's Figure 4 . The district court also found that Crown 's expert , Martin Higham , did not address the anticipating embodiment referred to by Ball 's expert , Dean Scranton . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Crown timely appealed . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . The critical questions on appeal are ( 1 ) whether the specification supports the asserted claims and ( 2 ) whether the testimony of the experts raises a genuine issue of material fact as to what Toyo teaches . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . ANALYSIS _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Written Description _NEWLINE_ Summary judgment is appropriate `` if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law .

A district court 's grant of summary judgment on written description is reviewed de novo . All Dental Prodx LLC v. Advantage Dental Prods. , 309 F.3d 774 , 778 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ball argues that the common specification of the ¡¬826 and ¡¬875 patents teaches seaming and cans adapted to be seamed such that driving occurs only outside of the reinforcing bead . As such , Ball argues that the asserted claims , which cover driving either inside or outside of the can end 's reinforcing bead , violate the written description requirement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The written description requirement is contained within 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 , which provides : _NEWLINE_ The specification shall contain a written description of the invention , and of the manner and process of making and using it , in such full , clear , concise , and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains , or with which it is most nearly connected , to make and use the same , and shall set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The test for sufficiency of a written description is `` whether the disclosure clearly 'allow [ s ] persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that [ the inventor ] invented what is claimed . ' `` Ariad Pharms. , Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co. , 598 F.3d 1336 , 1351 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) ( en banc ) ( quoting Vas-Cath Inc. v. Mahurkar , 935 F.2d 1555 , 1562-63 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ) . The disclosure must `` reasonably convey [ ] to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date . '' Id . at 1351 . Possession means `` possession as shown in the disclosure '' and `` requires an objective inquiry into the four corners of the specification from the perspective of a person of ordinary skill in the art . '' Id . Original claims are part of the specification and in many cases will satisfy the written description requirement . Id . at 1349 . However , certain claims , such as claims to a functionally defined genus , will not satisfy the written description requirement without a disclosure showing that the applicant had invented species sufficient to support the claim . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Crown 's asserted claims are not broad genus claims or function claims simply describing the desired result of saving metal . Therefore , the critical question is whether the specification , including the original claim language , demonstrates that the applicants had possession of an embodiment that improved metal usage by increasing the slope of the chuck wall without also limiting the width of the reinforcing bead . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Crown relies on our decision in Revolution Eyewear for the proposition that `` [ i ] nventors can frame their claims to address one problem or several , and the written description requirement will be satisfied as to each claim as long as the description conveys that the inventor was in possession of the invention recited in the claim . '' 563 F.3d at 1367 . In this case , Crown contends that the specification teaches two separate solutions for improving metal usage : increasing the slope of the chuck wall of the can end and limiting the width of the reinforcing bead . According *1381 to Crown , nothing in the specification requires employment of both methods in all instances . Where one does not elect to limit the width of the reinforcing bead , Crown contends that driving can occur either inside or outside of the reinforcing bead . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with Crown that the written description supports the asserted claims . Ball contends that Revolution Eyewear does not apply to a specification in which the prior art problems are related to one another . According to Ball , for Revolution Eyewear to apply , a specification must independently present separate solutions to independent problems . Ball misstates our holding in Revolution Eyewear . To the contrary , we specifically held in Revolution Eyewear that it is a `` false premise that if the problems addressed by the invention are related , then a claim addressing only one of the problems is invalid for lack of sufficient written description . '' 563 F.3d at 1367 . Ball attempts to distinguish Revolution Eyewear by arguing that the specification here mandates that the prior art problems ( metal usage and risk of damage with a narrower reinforcing bead ) must always be solved together . But the specification specifically ties the fracturing and scuffing problems to the narrower reinforcing beads and not the increased angle of the can end wall . See ¡¬826 patent col.3 ll.45-50 . Nowhere does the specification teach that metal savings can only be achieved by increasing the chuck wall angle along with narrowing the reinforcing bead . Tables 1-5 show pressure performance of can ends with various chuck wall angles but do not suggest that a wider chuck wall angle requires a narrower reinforcing bead . Id . col.5 l.29-col.8 l.3 . Even more to the point , Table 6 shows that even where the reinforcing bead 's width is held constant , increasing the chuck wall 's slope relative to vertical brings about a savings in the diameter of the starting material ( the `` cut edge '' ) . Simply put , the specification supports the asserted claims that achieve metal savings by varying the slope of the chuck wall alone . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While the patents teach two independent ways to save metal , the advantages of limiting the chuck to driving outside the reinforcing bead only come into play when one narrows the reinforcing bead . That is when `` the chuck bead becomes narrower and more likely to fracture . '' Id . col.3 ll.47-48 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Crown 's original claims clearly show that the applicants recognized and were claiming an improvement in metal usage by increasing the slope of the chuck wall over that used in the prior art without any additional limitation of narrowing the width of the reinforcing bead . Notably , Crown adds the limitation requiring that there be no `` driving contact between said chuck and said can end bead interior surface '' in dependent claims 22 and 40 of the ¡¬ 875 patent . ¡¬875 patent col.12 ll.21-26 , col.14 ll.31-36 . The added limitation would not be needed if the inventors had in mind that in all cases driving would occur outside the reinforcing bead . These claims show , as Ariad recognized many original claims do , that the applicants had in mind the invention as claimed . And while Ball is correct in noting that the embodiment drawings in the specification all show chuck drive outside the reinforcing bead , that does not compel the conclusion that the written description is so narrowly tailored as to preclude Crown from claiming an embodiment that only utilizes the angled chuck wall solution . See Lampi Corp. v. Am . Power Prods. , 228 F.3d 1365 , 1378 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( concluding that the drawings at issue were `` merely a 'practical example ' of the invention '' and did not limit the patent to identical half-shells ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1382 Ball also contends that increasing the slope of the can end 's chuck wall necessarily requires a frustoconical drive surface which engages the chuck wall rather than the reinforcing bead . Ball 's argument suggests that one of ordinary skill in the art could not seam a can end with an increased sloped chuck wall except by driving on the can end 's chuck wall while avoiding contact with the reinforcing bead . But that contention implicates enablement , not written description . Indeed , Ball 's argument here boils down to whether the specification `` describe [ s ] the manner and process of making and using the invention so as to enable a person of skill in the art to make and use the full scope of the invention without undue experimentation . '' LizardTech , Inc. v. Earth Res . Mapping , 424 F.3d 1336 , 1344-45 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( also noting that enablement and written description `` usually rise and fall together '' ) . However , Ball has never asserted an enablement challenge to the specification , nor does Ball claim to introduce an enablement challenge on appeal . Perhaps more importantly , there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Crown 's patents are not enabled . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ball 's reliance on Tronzo v. Biomet , Inc. , 156 F.3d 1154 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) , LizardTech , and ICU Med. , Inc. v. Alaris Med . Sys. , 558 F.3d 1368 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) is similarly misplaced . In each of those cases , the specification unambiguously limited the scope of the invention . In Tronzo , the patentee in a later-filed application asserted claims covering cup implants which were generic as to shape despite the fact that the specification only discussed conical shaped cups , characterized the conical shape as being `` an extremely important aspect '' of the invention , and only mentioned other shapes in specifically distinguishing the prior art as inferior . Tronzo , 156 F.3d at 1159 . Crown 's patents do warn that `` [ a ] s can ends are developed with narrower anti peaking beads the chuck head ... becomes narrower and more likely to fracture . '' ¡¬826 patent col.3 ll.45-50 . The ¡¬875 patent includes claims addressing this problem ( see ¡¬875 patent col.12 ll.21-26 , col.14 ll.31-37 ) but nowhere suggests that saving metal by increasing the slope of a can end 's chuck wall necessarily requires that there be no driving contact with the interior of the reinforcing bead . The problems the patents address are related , but they are still separate , and solving one does not necessarily require solving the other . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In LizardTech , the claims at issue were invalidated on both written description and enablement grounds because the specification disclosed only one specific method for solving one particular problem-creating `` seamless '' discrete wavelet transforms for use in electronic image data compression . 424 F.3d at 1345 . In contrast , Crown 's patents identify at least two ways of solving the problem of metal usage . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , in ICU Medical , the specification at issue was clear that having a spike within the medical valve was necessary to the use of the claimed invention . 558 F.3d at 1378-79 . Again , Crown makes no such narrow disclosure here . In fact , the specification in this case clearly shows a chuck entering the reinforcing bead in the prior art ( Figure 2 ) . It is only when one elects to narrow the reinforcing bead that the location of chuck drive becomes an issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also failed to distinguish in its written description analysis between Crown 's only asserted product claim , Claim 14 of the ¡¬875 patent , and Crown 's method claims , Claims 50 and 52 . Claim 14 covers a metal can end with certain features . The district court found the written description deficient because it failed to include a negative limitation requiring that , during the process of seaming *1383 the can end to the can body , a chuck not drive in the can end 's reinforcing bead . Claim 14 , as a product claim , however , recites structural limitations as opposed to method steps . In fact , the PTO specifically required the inventors to file a divisional application and separate the method and product claims . A `` patentee need only describe the product as claimed , and need not describe an unclaimed method of making the claimed product . '' Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel , Inc. , 314 F.3d 1313 , 1331-33 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . The district court , therefore , erred in holding that there was an inadequate written description supporting claim 14 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In sum , we hold that the district court erred in holding that the asserted claims violated the written description requirement . Therefore , we reverse and enter judgment for Crown on its cross-motion . See PowerOasis , 522 F.3d at 1307 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( noting that compliance with the written description requirement is subject to summary judgment if no reasonable fact finder could return a verdict for the non-moving party ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Anticipation _NEWLINE_ Crown also contends that the district court erred in finding that Toyo anticipates the asserted claims . The parties disagree as to whether Toyo inherently discloses the upward bending of a can end wall ( or chuck wall ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We review de novo grants of summary judgment based on ¡± 102 anticipation . Telemac Cellular Corp. v. Topp Telecom , Inc. , 247 F.3d 1316 , 1327 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . To challenge the patent , Ball must prove by clear and convincing evidence that Toyo discloses , either expressly or inherently , every limitation as asserted in the claims : `` To anticipate a claim , a single prior art reference must expressly or inherently disclose each claim limitation ... . But disclosure of each element is not quite enough-this court has long held that ' [ a ] nticipation requires the presence in a single prior art disclosure of all elements of a claimed invention arranged as in the claim . ' `` Finisar Corp. v. DirecTV Group , Inc. , 523 F.3d 1323 , 1334-35 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( quoting Connell v. Sears , Roebuck & Co. , 722 F.2d 1542 , 1548 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ) . Moreover , inherent anticipation requires more than mere probabilistic inherency , see Continental Can Co. USA v. Monsanto Co. , 948 F.2d 1264 , 1269 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) , and more than the presence of an unrecognized de minimis quantity of claimed substance in the prior art . See In re Seaborg , 51 CCPA 1109 , 328 F.2d 996 ( 1964 ) . But these cases `` do not show that inherency requires recognition '' of the inherent element . See Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms. , Inc. , 339 F.3d 1373 , 1377 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ball contends that the district court correctly determined that Toyo disclosed more than one unseamed end and that Ball need only demonstrate that a single embodiment of Toyo anticipates the asserted claims in order for it to be entitled to summary judgment on the basis of anticipation . Arthrocare Corp. v. Smith & Nephew , Inc. , 406 F.3d 1365 , 1372 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( noting that `` it was error for the district court to limit the disclosure of the prior art reference to a preferred embodiment '' ) . However , Mr. Scranton ( Ball 's expert ) and Mr. Higham ( Crown 's expert ) dispute whether any embodiment exists that anticipates the asserted claims . Ball contends that Mr. Higham addressed only Toyo 's claim 1 embodiment while Mr. Scranton focused on Toyo 's claim 2 . Mr. Higham 's report is not as narrow as Ball contends . While Mr. Higham did not mention Toyo 's claim 2 embodiment specifically , he did not need to because he offered an opinion on the category of can *1384 ends relevant to Toyo as a whole . Nowhere did Mr. Higham limit his opinion to any particular embodiments . According to Mr. Higham 's opinion , any unseamed can end taught in Toyo would require a portion of the end wall to be bent upwardly during seaming-including the can end in Toyo 's claim 2-and therefore could not have been used to arrive at the seamed end depicted in Toyo 's Figure 4 . Mr. Higham explains that it would have been impossible to bend a portion of the can end wall upwardly around a chuck juncture during seaming to a can body that had not been subjected to a necking step . According to Mr. Higham , this `` neck '' is created when the diameter at the top of the can body is reduced relative to the diameter of the main body . Toyo 's Figure 4 , however , does not show a can body with a neck . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Simply put , Mr. Scranton opined that , to arrive at the seamed can end shown in Toyo 's Figure 4 , the unseamed end of claim 2 must necessarily have been bent upwardly around an inherent chuck by more than 10 degrees . In contrast , Mr. Higham opined that one could never arrive at Figure 4 's seamed end if starting with an unseamed end that would require upward bending during seaming , because that would necessitate a necked can contrary to the one depicted in Figure 4 . At bottom , Mr. Higham 's opinion suggests that Toyo does not inherently disclose each limitation of the asserted claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Where there is a material dispute as to the credibility and weight that should be afforded to conflicting expert reports , summary judgment is usually inappropriate . Scripps Clinic & Research Found . v. Genentech , Inc. , 927 F.2d 1565 , 1578 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( `` To the extent that apparent inconsistencies among the [ expert 's ] three declarations raise questions of credibility and weight ... they were improperly resolved on summary judgment. '' ) . Ball 's various arguments regarding Mr. Higham 's change in position during the prosecution and throughout the course of this litigation are proper matters for a jury to weigh in making a credibility determination . Accordingly , we reverse the district court 's holding with respect to anticipation and remand for trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. Obviousness _NEWLINE_ Because the issue of obviousness has not been finally resolved by the district court , we decline to address Ball 's assertion of that defense . See MIT v. Abacus , 462 F.3d 1344 , 1359 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( `` To the extent that we have jurisdiction to consider the marking statute issues , we decline to address them because those questions have not been finally resolved by the district court. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we reverse the district court 's entry of summary judgment with respect to written description and instead enter judgment for Crown . We reverse and remand for trial with respect to the district court 's grant of summary judgment on anticipation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED AND REMANDED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ Costs are awarded to Crown . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DYK , Circuit Judge , concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I join Parts I , IIB , and IIC of the majority opinion . However , I respectfully dissent from Part IIA . In my view , method claims 50 and 52 of the ¡¬875 patent and product claim 14 of the ¡¬826 patent are invalid for failure to satisfy the written description requirement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I agree with the majority that the ¡¬875 and ¡¬826 patents are directed to solving *1385 two problems : ( 1 ) reducing metal usage , and ( 2 ) reducing scuffing to the can end wall . The metal usage problem is solved by `` increasing the slope of the chuck wall and limiting the width of the anti-peaking bead . '' ¡¬875 Patent col.1 ll.33-34 . The scuffing problem is solved by designing a chuck that drives only outside , and not inside , of the new , narrower anti-peaking bead ( `` bead '' ) . See id . col.4 ll.44-47 ( `` The chuck ... is designed to enter the chuck wall without scratching or scuffing a coating on the can end ; not to drive on the concave bead surface as shown [ in the prior art ] . '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 50 , from which claim 52 depends , addresses only the metal usage problem by increasing the slope of the chuck wall . It provides in relevant part : _NEWLINE_ performing said seaming operation by placing one or more seaming rolls into contact with said peripheral cover hook ... while said can end rotates so as ... to bend a portion of said can end wall upwardly around said juncture of said chuck walls at a first location on said can end wall , a straight line extending from said first location on said can end wall to said transition between said can end wall and said reinforcing bead inclined between about 20¢X and about 60¢X with respect to said axial centerline both before and after said seaming operation . _NEWLINE_ Id . col.15 ll.30-41 . Thus , claim 50 discloses an embodiment in which a can end wall having an increased slope can be combined with the wider , prior art bead , and it is not limited to driving the chuck outside the bead . The question , then , is whether this embodiment is disclosed in the specification and whether claims 50 and 52 can satisfy the written description requirement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Relying on Revolution Eyewear , the majority holds that the claims are valid . However , Revolution Eyewear , in holding that a claim may address only one of the purposes disclosed in the specification , still requires explicit disclosure of the embodiments in the claims : `` Inventors can frame their claims to address one problem or several , and the written description requirement will be satisfied as to each claim as long as the description conveys that the inventor was in possession of the invention recited in that claim . '' Revolution Eyewear , Inc. v. Aspex Eyewear , Inc. , 563 F.3d 1358 , 1367 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( emphasis added ) . Therefore , the claims , whether directed to solving a single problem or multiple problems , must still be grounded in the specification . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is no question that the specification does not teach combining the sloped can end wall together with the wider , prior art bead and driving the chuck into the bead instead of the sloped can end wall . That combination is a new and distinct invention , and our written description jurisprudence requires that it be described in the specification . The fact that the claims are broad enough to cover such an invention or imply that the claims cover such an invention is not sufficient when the invention itself is not described either in the claims or elsewhere in the specification . The failure of the specification to describe the invention requires invalidation of claims 50 and 52 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Similarly , product claim 14 , which depends from claim 13 , discloses a can end wall having an increased slope in combination with a wider , prior art bead . Because this combination is a separate invention not disclosed in the specification , claim 14 is also invalid for failure to satisfy the written description . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Under our written description precedent , failure to disclose a claimed invention is fatal to a claim 's validity . In Ariad Pharmaceuticals , Inc. v. Eli Lilly & Co. , 598 F.3d 1336 , 1351 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) , we *1386 held that `` the hallmark of written description is disclosure . '' `` [ I ] f the claimed invention does not appear in the specification , ... the claim ... fails regardless [ of ] whether one of skill in the art could make or use the claimed invention . '' Id . at 1348 . The specification must convey with `` reasonable clarity '' to those of skill in the art that the inventor was in possession of the claimed invention as of the filing date of the patent application . Vas-Cath , Inc. v. Mahurkar , 935 F.2d 1555 , 1563-64 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For these reasons , I would affirm summary judgment that product claim 14 of the ¡¬826 patent and method claims 50 and 52 of the ¡¬875 patent are invalid for failure to comply with the written description requirement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 635 F.3d 1373 , 98 U.S.P.Q.2d 1244 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Honorable Ronald M.

We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ The technology at issue in this case involves wireless transmission of caller identification ( ID ) information .

Intellect Wireless , Inc. v. HTC Corp. , 910 F.Supp.2d 1056 ( N.D.Ill.2012 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Intellect appeals . We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ `` To prove inequitable conduct , the challenger must show by clear and convincing evidence that the patent applicant ( 1 ) misrepresented or omitted information material to patentability , and ( 2 ) *1342 did so with specific intent to mislead or deceive '' the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) . In re Rosuvastatin Calcium Patent Litig. , 703 F.3d 511 , 519 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) . `` When the patentee has engaged in affirmative acts of egregious misconduct , such as the filing of an unmistakably false affidavit , the misconduct is material .

Materiality _NEWLINE_ The district court held that HTC proved the materiality prong of inequitable conduct . The court found that Mr. Henderson submitted to the PTO a declaration under 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.131 ( Rule 131 ) containing false statements . To overcome a prior art reference during prosecution , Mr. Henderson averred that `` the claimed invention was actually reduced to practice and was demonstrated at a meeting ... in July of 1993 . '' J.A . 7731 ? 9 . However , the district court found that the claimed subject matter was never actually reduced to practice . Intellect , 910 F.Supp.2d at 1071-72 ; see J.A . 2169 ; J.A . 5389 ; J.A . 5470 . The court also found `` no evidence that any of the false statements in any of the declarations were actually withdrawn , specifically called to the attention of the PTO or fully corrected . '' Intellect , 910 F.Supp.2d at 1072 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Intellect argues that the district court clearly erred in its materiality finding . Intellect contends that Mr. Henderson 's prosecuting attorney quickly corrected the false declaration by filing a revised Rule 131 declaration , which did not include facts supporting actual reduction to practice . See J.A . 7742-846 . It argues that the attorney explained to the Examiner that the applicant was relying on constructive reduction to practice . Intellect contends that , after the asserted patents issued , the Examiner confirmed that he relied on constructive , as opposed to actual , reduction to practice . Intellect lastly argues that the district court discounted evidence that the remaining reference to `` actual reduction to practice '' in the revised declaration was an inadvertent mistake . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ HTC counters that the district court did not clearly err when it found materiality because Mr. Henderson filed multiple unmistakably false declarations during prosecution . Specifically , it argues that Mr. Henderson falsely claimed actual reduction to practice in the original Rule 131 declaration in order to overcome a prior art reference . HTC points out that the revised declaration still referred to `` actual reduction to practice . '' HTC argues that Mr. Henderson made this false assertion during prosecution of other family patents , which suggests that this language was not mere drafting error . HTC contends that neither Mr. Henderson nor his attorney expressly advised the PTO about the misrepresentations during prosecution , as required to cure the misconduct . It further argues that Mr. Henderson 's post-issuance efforts to clarify the record do not cure the misconduct because they are self-serving statements made during litigation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with HTC . It is undisputed that Mr. Henderson 's original declaration was unmistakably false . Absent curing , this alone establishes materiality . There is no dispute in this case that Mr. Henderson did not actually reduce the claimed invention to practice-nor did he demonstrate a prototype in July of 1993 . Thus , the original declaration contains multiple unmistakably false statements . See J.A . 7731 ? ? 9 , 10 , 11 ( `` the claimed invention was actually reduced to practice *1343 and was demonstrated at a meeting '' ; `` the working prototype demonstration included communicating information from a calling party connected to a communications network that provided caller identifying information to a called party '' ; referring to a device that `` displayed the caller identification and associated image information transmitted via a wireless network '' ) . Intellect argues that Mr. Henderson 's revised declaration and subsequent statements to the PTO corrected these misrepresentations . We do not agree . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When an applicant files a false declaration , we require that the applicant `` expressly advise the PTO of [ the misrepresentation 's ] existence , stating specifically wherein it resides . '' Rohm & Haas Co. v. Crystal Chem . Co. , 722 F.2d 1556 , 1572 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . Further , `` if the misrepresentation is of one or more facts , the PTO [ must ] be advised what the actual facts are . '' Id . Finally , the applicant must `` take the necessary action ... openly . It does not suffice that one knowing of misrepresentations in an application or in its prosecution merely supplies the examiner with accurate facts without calling his attention to the untrue or misleading assertions sought to be overcome , leaving him to formulate his own conclusions . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court did not err in concluding that Mr. Henderson 's revised declaration failed to correct the falsehoods in the original declaration under the Rohm & Haas standard . See Intellect , 910 F.Supp.2d at 1071-73 . At best , the revised declaration obfuscated the truth . It mentioned `` diligence from the date of conception to the effective filing date , '' implying that Mr. Henderson was now relying upon constructive reduction to practice . J.A . 7745 . But the revised declaration did not cure the misconduct because it never expressly negated the false references to actual reduction to practice in the original declaration . In the original declaration , Mr. Henderson told the PTO that he actually reduced the invention to practice and demonstrated it at a meeting in July of 1993 . See J.A . 7731 ? 9 . In the revised declaration , he described a `` prototype now in the Smithsonian that was in development for a ... demonstration '' in July of 1993 , a statement that could be read to mean that a device embodying the claimed invention was actually built during that month . J.A . 7746 ? U . The revised declaration also described a `` product brochure and packing receipt , '' which further implied the existence of an actual working device . J.A . 7747 ? GG ; J.A . 7852-57 . Finally , the revised declaration expressly mentioned `` actual reduction to practice '' and `` bringing the claimed subject matter to commercialization , '' further obscuring the truth . J.A . 7747 ? 11 ; J.A . 7748 ? 12 . Most importantly , the declaration nowhere expressly stated the actual facts , which are that `` neither [ Mr. Henderson ] nor Intellect Wireless actually reduced to practice '' the inventions claimed in the asserted patents . J.A . 2169 . Nowhere did the declaration openly advise the PTO of Mr. Henderson 's misrepresentations , as our precedent clearly requires . See Rohm & Haas , 722 F.2d at 1572 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Intellect asserts that Mr. Henderson 's attorney `` specifically advised the Examiner on multiple occasions of the mistaken claim of actual reduction to practice . '' Intellect Br . 35 . But the record contradicts Intellect 's position . The prosecution history of the asserted patents is devoid of any statement by Mr. Henderson openly admitting that he did not actually reduce the claimed invention to practice . Mr. Henderson 's attorney testified that , in a phone call , he told the Examiner that the `` revised declaration had none of the actual reduction to practice elements in it '' because `` Mr. Henderson had some misgivings about the actual reduction to practice . '' *1344 J.A . 4026 . And Mr. Henderson claims that the Examiner allowed the claims based on constructive reduction to practice . See id . ; see also J.A . 5602 ( `` [ The Examiner ] told us that he had considered only constructive reduction to practice ... . '' ) ; J.A . 7982 ( indicating reliance on the revised declaration ) . Neither the PTO nor the public was apprised of the falsehoods in Mr. Henderson 's declarations and told the actual facts . Thus , the district court correctly found that `` [ a ] full disclosure or correction of the record was never made . '' Intellect , 910 F.Supp.2d at 1074 . We hold that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that HTC proved materiality by establishing that Mr. Henderson engaged in affirmative egregious misconduct when he filed a false declaration . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We note that Therasense in no way modified Rohm & Haas 's holding that the materiality prong of inequitable conduct is met when an applicant files a false affidavit and fails to cure the misconduct . Therasense expressly cited Rohm & Haas with approval and made clear that filing a false affidavit is exactly the sort of `` affirmative act [ ] of egregious misconduct '' that renders the misconduct `` material . '' 649 F.3d at 1292 . Indeed , Therasense quoted Rohm & Haas for the proposition that `` there is no room to argue that submission of false affidavits is not material . '' Id . ( quoting 722 F.2d at 1571 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . The district court was faithful to the requirements articulated in Rohm & Haas . Given the false statements and the clear failure to do what is necessary according to our precedent to cure the misconduct , the argument that materiality has not been established is entirely without merit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . Intent _NEWLINE_ The district court found that Mr. Henderson acted with specific intent to deceive the PTO . Intellect , 910 F.Supp.2d at 1073-74 . The court found that , in addition to misrepresentations during prosecution of the asserted patents , Mr. Henderson made false statements regarding actual reduction to practice during prosecution of related patents in order to overcome prior art . For example , during prosecution of another patent in the family , Mr. Henderson submitted a declaration stating that he had constructed a handheld device that `` displayed ... message information transmitted via the wireless network . '' Id . at 1062-63 ; see J.A . 21910 ? 11 . However , the court found that no such transmission took place-the device only contained preloaded images for the purpose of demonstration . Intellect , 910 F.Supp.2d at 1071 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ During prosecution of still another patent in the family , Mr. Henderson submitted a press release to the PTO stating that the Smithsonian acquired `` two prototypes ... for a pioneering picturephone technology developed in 1993 . '' J.A . 25811 . The district court found that this statement was misleading because Mr. Henderson gave the Smithsonian a device identified as `` Intellect prototype '' in 2003 , and later gave the Smithsonian imitation smartphones made of wood and plastic . Intellect , 910 F.Supp.2d at 1067-68 . To be clear , the wood and plastic imitation smartphones were not capable of performing the claimed functions . The court found that , given the pattern of false and misleading statements during prosecution of related patents , Mr. Henderson 's explanations for the misrepresentations during prosecution of the asserted patents were not credible . Id . at 1073 . The court therefore concluded that intent to deceive the PTO was the single most reasonable inference from Mr. Henderson 's false assertions . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Intellect argues that there was no specific intent to deceive . It contends that *1345 Mr. Henderson 's multiple attempts to correct the record demonstrate that intent to deceive is not the most reasonable inference . Intellect argues that Mr. Henderson 's attorney explained that he made an inadvertent mistake in the original declaration by including references to actual reduction to practice . Intellect further argues that the court ignored evidence that the Examiner relied on constructive , rather than actual , reduction to practice . It contends that these facts demonstrate that the district court 's finding that Mr. Henderson intended to defraud the PTO was not the most reasonable inference . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Intellect also contends that the court 's findings regarding a pattern of deceit are erroneous . Intellect argues that , even though a device that Mr. Henderson used in his demonstration contained only preloaded images , that feature is consistent with the specification 's teaching that the device can display a `` preselected image , such as an icon . '' ¡¬186 patent , col. 39 ll . 18-19 . It argues that the Smithsonian press release is irrelevant because it was submitted after the asserted patents were allowed , during prosecution of a later application . With regard to statements about actual reduction to practice in the revised declaration , Intellect contends that the district court should have drawn the inference that it was a `` copy-and-paste '' error . It further argues that the court 's finding that Mr. Henderson lacked credibility was clear error because HTC failed to prove that deceit was deliberate . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We see no clear error in the district court 's fact finding on intent . Submission of an affidavit containing fabricated examples of actual reduction to practice in order to overcome a prior art reference raises a strong inference of intent to deceive . See Rohm & Haas , 722 F.2d at 1571 . Further , Mr. Henderson engaged in a pattern of deceit , which makes the inference stronger . In order to obtain claims directed to wireless transmission in several related patents , Mr. Henderson told the PTO that he built a device that could receive images via wireless transmission . See , e.g. , J.A . 17001-02 ? ? 5-13 ( U.S. Patent No . 7,426,264 ) ; J.A . 21910 ? 11 ( U.S. Patent No . 7,251,318 ) ; J.A . 24136-37 ? ? 5-13 ( U.S. Patent No . 7,454,000 ) . Nevertheless , the device was , at best , a `` simulation '' -it contained only preloaded images and was not capable of wireless communication . See , e.g. , J.A . 5449-52 ; J.A . 5461-65 ; J.A . 5535 ; see also Intellect , 910 F.Supp.2d at 1071 ( `` Whatever ... data was pre-loaded in the device , the means , a wireless network or telephone , did not exist in July of 1993 to transmit caller ID information , a picture , an image or an emoticon. '' ) . Intellect 's argument that the declaration `` satisfies the specification '' fails because the patent claims are directed to wireless communication . See , e.g. , U.S. Patent No . 7,251,318 , claim 1 ( reciting a `` communications network to wirelessly transmit the caller ID and the picture from the message center to the wireless portable communication device '' ) . While the misleading Smithsonian press release was submitted after the asserted patents were allowed , it reinforces the pattern of deceit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , the district court 's finding of intent could be affirmed based on the content of the two declarations . The completely false statements in a first declaration were followed by a replacement declaration that , rather than expressly admitting the earlier falsity , dances around the truth . The second declaration , which claims to rely on constructive rather than actual reduction to practice , continues to reference a `` prototype '' ( that was never built ) , a `` product brochure '' ( even though there was no product ) , and `` commercialization '' ( that never occurred ) . J.A . 7746 ? U ; J.A . 7747 ? GG ; J.A . 7748 ? 12 . As discussed earlier , neither Mr. *1346 Henderson nor his attorney told the Examiner the truth . Thus , the district court did not clearly err in concluding that specific intent to deceive the PTO was the most reasonable inference from Mr. Henderson 's conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also did not err when it decided not to credit Mr. Henderson 's explanations for the repeated submission of false affidavits . `` [ C ] redibility determinations are an aspect of fact-finding that appellate courts should rarely reverse . '' Star Scientific , Inc. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. , 537 F.3d 1357 , 1368 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) . The pattern of deceit supports the court 's finding that Mr. Henderson 's explanations for making false statements during prosecution of the asserted patents are not credible . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ We have considered the parties ' remaining arguments and do not find them to be persuasive . We affirm the district court 's judgment that the asserted patents are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 732 F.3d 1339 , 108 U.S.P.Q.2d 1563

See Marquip , Inc. v. Fosber America , Inc. , No . 96-C-726-S ( W.D.Wis . Sept.14 , 1998 ) ( order ) . The district court also denied Marquip , Inc. 's motion for relief under Fed.R.Civ.P . 60 ( b ) . See Marquip , Inc. v. Fosber America , Inc. , 30 F.Supp.2d 1142 ( W.D.Wis . 1998 ) ( order ) . Because the district court properly concluded as a matter of law that the claims at issue can not cover the accused device under the doctrine of equivalents , this court affirms . This court also affirms the district court 's denial of the Rule 60 ( b ) motion because the district court did not abuse its discretion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ The '276 patent claims a method and device for shingling and stacking corrugated paperboard sheets without interrupting the continuous flow of sheets . Because the corrugator runs continuously , it is difficult to remove completed stacks of sheets without interrupting the flow of the corrugator . The invention solves this problem by creating a gap in the flow of sheets . The gap allows sufficient time to discharge a completed stack without interrupting the corrugator . Claims 9 and 13 , the only two claims at issue , recite a method and a device , respectively , for automatically *1365 changing the speed of the conveyor belts to create a gap : _NEWLINE_ 9 . In the method of conveying sheets in succession from a first location along a plurality of separate in-line conveyors to a stacker wherein a vertical stack of a predetermined number of sheets is to be formed , and wherein said plurality of conveyors are traveling at the same speed , the steps of : _NEWLINE_ ( a ) shingling said sheets as they pass said location to form a group of shingled sheets for stacking , _NEWLINE_ ( b ) increasing the speed of said group of shingled sheets , _NEWLINE_ ( c ) and slowing each said separate in-line conveyor individually and seccessively [ sic ] in a downstream direction in response to passage of the trailing end of said group past the end of each respective separate conveyor to thereby slow sheets traveling upstream of said group of sheets . _NEWLINE_ 13 . In a device for conveying sheets in succession from a first location along a plurality of separate in-line conveyors to a stacker wherein a vertical stack of a predetermined number of sheets is to be formed , and wherein said plurality of conveyors are traveling at the same speed , the combination comprising : _NEWLINE_ ( a ) means for shingling said sheets as they pass said location to form a group of shingled sheets for stacking , _NEWLINE_ ( b ) means for increasing the speed of said group of shingled sheets , _NEWLINE_ ( c ) and means for slowing each said separate in-line conveyor individually and successively in a downstream direction in response to passage of the trailing end of said group past the end of each respective separate conveyor to thereby slow sheets traveling upstream of said group of sheets . _NEWLINE_ '276 patent , col. 7 , ll . 22-39 ; col. 8 , ll . 31-47 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Marquip asserts that versions 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 of the Fosber device infringe claims 9 and 13 of the '276 patent . Both parties rely on a stipulated description of the process in the accused Fosber devices . Version 2 is the most basic of the Fosber devices . In Version 2 , a `` shingling nip '' continuously shingles or overlaps sheets onto a moving conveyor . The first conveyor moves the shingled sheets to a second conveyor , which moves at the same speed as the first . The Fosber device has an interrupt mechanism between the first and second conveyors . This mechanism grasps and holds some sheets to create a gap in the flow of sheets . Specifically , when the trailing end of the last sheet in a predetermined number of sheets ( the preceding group ) moves past the pinch point of the interrupt mechanism , the mechanism grabs and stops the next sheet . This action creates a gap and starts the next group of a predetermined number of sheets ( the succeeding group ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At about the same time the interrupter grasps the first sheet in the next group , two other events also occur : ( 1 ) the second conveyor and all other conveyors downstream of the interrupt mechanism speed up , carrying the preceding group toward a stacker at the end of the conveyors , and ( 2 ) the first conveyor slows down . When the preceding group leaves the third conveyor , the second conveyor slows again to the pace of the first conveyor and the interrupt mechanism releases the succeeding group . Similarly , the third conveyor slows when the preceding group passes the fourth conveyor . The fourth conveyor slows when the preceding group is on a downstacker at the end of the conveyors . The downstacker discharges the preceding group from the stacker and makes room for a new stack . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Fosber 's Version 1 differs from Version 2 only in the location of the interrupt mechanism-namely midway along the second conveyor . When the interrupt mechanism closes , the interrupt mechanism itself moves at the same speed as the first conveyor . In Version 1 , the second conveyor operates exactly the same as in Version 2 , namely speeding up to widen *1366 the gap . Version 3 is the same as Version 1 , except that two conveyors replace the first conveyor , but they always run at the same speed . Version 4 is the same as Version 2 except that , again , two conveyors replace the first conveyor and always run at the same speed . For purposes of this opinion , it suffices to discuss Version 2 as representative of all Fosber devices , which contain an interrupt mechanism and conveyors with varying speeds . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the initial trial , the district court considered two of Marquip 's patents , the '276 patent and U.S. Patent No . 4,273,325 . The district court granted summary judgment that Fosber did not infringe the two patents either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents . See Marquip , Inc. v. Fosber America , Inc. , No . 96-C-726-S ( W.D.Wis . June 10 , 1997 ) ( order ) ( Marquip I ) . When Marquip appealed Marquip I , this court affirmed the district court 's grant of summary judgment that Fosber did not literally infringe the '276 patent but vacated the summary judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . See Marquip , Inc. v. Fosber America , Inc. , 155 F.3d 567 , 1998 WL 314628 , No . 97-1441 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( Marquip II ) . As part of the ruling , this court construed the limitation `` group '' as an accumulation of a predetermined number of sheets . On remand , the district court again granted summary judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . See Marquip , Inc. v. Fosber America , Inc. , No . 96-C-726-S ( W.D.Wis . Sept.14 , 1998 ) ( order ) ( Marquip III ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The critical issue in Marquip III was whether element ( c ) of claims 9 and 13 covered the Fosber device . The district court concluded that the Fosber device performs the recited function of slowing the conveyors and obtains the result of decreasing the speed of the sheets traveling upstream . See id . at 10 . The district court determined , however , that the Fosber device performs the function `` in a fundamentally different way . '' Id . In particular , the district court held that `` [ t ] he presence of a functional interrupt mechanism [ in the Fosber device ] , not the minimal change in timing required by its presence , is that which makes defendants ' machines operate in a substantially different way '' from the claimed inventions . Id . at 13 . Marquip appeals . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In a separate appeal , Marquip appeals the district court 's refusal to set aside final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P . 60 ( b ) . See Marquip , Inc. v. Fosber America Inc. , No . 96-C-726-S ( W.D.Wis . Dec.8 , 1998 ) ( order ) ( Marquip IV ) . Marquip based its motion on newly discovered evidence about the Fosber device , allegedly withheld by Fosber during discovery . This court consolidates the two appeals and addresses both the infringement and Rule 60 ( b ) issues in this opinion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ This court reviews a district court 's grant of summary judgment without deference . See Conroy v. Reebok Int ' l , Ltd. , 14 F.3d 1570 , 1575 , 29 USPQ2d 1373 , 1377 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . Summary judgment requires the moving party to show both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law . See Fed.R.Civ.P . 56 ( c ) . In reviewing the district court 's summary judgment , this court draws all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the non-movant , Marquip . See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , Inc. , 477 U.S. 242 , 255 , 106 S.Ct . 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 ( 1986 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To infringe under the doctrine of equivalents , the accused product must contain each claim element or its equivalent . See Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem . Co. , 520 U.S. 17 , 40 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 , 137 L.Ed.2d 146 , 41 USPQ2d 1865 , 1875 ( 1997 ) . The accused product is equivalent to a claimed element if the differences between the two are `` insubstantial '' to one of ordinary skill in the art . Id . at 39-40 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 ; *1367 Hilton Davis Chem . Co. v. Warner-Jenkinson Co. , 62 F.3d 1512 , 1517 , 35 USPQ2d 1641,1644 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( en banc ) , rev 'd on other grounds , 520 U.S. 17 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 , 137 L.Ed.2d 146 ( 1997 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Based on the fundamental principle that no one deserves an exclusive right to technology already in the public domain , this court has consistently limited the doctrine of equivalents to prevent its application to ensnare prior art . See Wilson Sporting Goods v. David Geoffrey & Assoc. , 904 F.2d 677 , 683 , 14 USPQ2d 1942 , 1948 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) . In Wilson Sporting Goods , this court explained the reasons prior art limits the range of equivalents . At the outset , this court posed the question : `` If the doctrine of equivalents does not involve expanding the claims , why should the prior art be a limitation on the range of permissible equivalents ? '' Id . at 684 ( emphasis in original ) . The answer to the question , this court explained , was not that courts construe claims narrowly to preserve their validity ; application of the doctrine of equivalents is not a claim interpretation process . See id . Rather , the reason for the limitation is to prevent the patentee from obtaining under the doctrine of equivalents coverage it could not have obtained from the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) by literal claims . Because prior art limits the exclusive right available to an inventor , it also limits the range of permissible equivalents of a claim . See id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As a helpful illustration of the operation of this limitation on the doctrine of equivalents , this court visualized a hypothetical patent claim , sufficient in scope to cover literally the accused device . See id . ; Key Mfg . Group , Inc. v. Microdot , Inc. , 925 F.2d 1444 , 1449 , 17 USPQ2d 1806 , 1810 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( `` While not obligatory in every doctrine of equivalents determination , the hypothetical claim rationale ... helps define the limits imposed by prior art on the range of equivalents. '' ) . Then this court examined whether the PTO would have allowed that hypothetical claim over the prior art at the time of invention . See Wilson Sporting Goods , 904 F.2d at 684 . If the claim would have been allowed , then prior art is not a bar to infringement by equivalents . If the claim would not have been allowed , prior art bars a finding of infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , the district court found that the application of the doctrine of the equivalents to encompass Fosber 's device would ensnare technology in the prior art at the time of Marquip 's invention . Specifically , the district court found that the Vermes prior art patent , U.S. Patent No . 4,040,618 , limits the range of permissible equivalents . Vermes teaches a sheet stacker with conveyor belts and an interrupt device . Specifically , Vermes discloses : _NEWLINE_ [ T ] he frictional interrupter bar 90 is the sole means used to interrupt the flow of sheets during the stack transfer cycle . The rubber pad of stop bar 90 frictionally engages the underside of the sheet passing over the gap between the two conveyors . Movement of the sheet is thereby stopped and at substantially the same time , conveyor 13 shifts to high speed mode and conveyor 12 shifts to low speed mode . At high speed , belt 13 quickly transfers onto the stack those sheets downstream of the raised interrupter bar 90 . In the meantime , the belt of conveyor 12 moving at low speed continues to receive sheets from the corrugator and advance them at about one-half normal speed , toward the bar 90 . In this way , an excessive pile up of sheets behind the stop bar is avoided . _NEWLINE_ U.S. Patent No . 4,040,618 , col. 9 , ll . 19-35 ( emphasis added ) . In other words , when the last sheet of the preceding group passes the interrupt mechanism , the Vermes interrupt mechanism engages and , at substantially the same time , the Vermes downstream conveyor accelerates and the upstream conveyor slows . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This description of the prior art Vermes technology describes with precision the operation of the Fosber accused device as well . When the processing circuitry of the Fosber device determines *1368 that the preceding group of sheets has completely passed through the shingling nip , the bar and rubber pad of the interrupt mechanism engage to prevent the succeeding group of sheets from feeding onto the next conveyor . At substantially the same time , Fosber 's downstream conveyor accelerates and the upstream conveyor slows . Significantly , in the Fosber device , as in Vermes , the upstream conveyor slows in response to the interrupt engaging , not in response to passage of the trailing end as the asserted claims recite . See Marquip II at *4 . In terms of the helpful Wilson Sporting Goods analysis , the Vermes prior art would have precluded patentability of a hypothetical claim encompassing all elements of the Fosber accused device . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Accordingly , it would be improper to interpret element ( c ) of the claims to cover the Fosber device by equivalence because to do so would render the asserted claims unpatentable over the prior art . See Wilson Sporting Goods , 904 F.2d at 684 . Indeed , the reexamination prosecution history of the '276 patent shows as well that the Fosber device does not infringe by equivalents element ( c ) of claims 9 and 13 . During reexamination of the '276 patent , the examiner considered prior art not previously before the PTO , including Vermes . Upon review , the examiner found that `` [ c ] laims 9 and 13 define over the prior art by the limitations at claim 9 ( c ) and claim 13 ( c ) relating to the slowing in response to the trailing end of the group . '' J.A . at 429 ( emphasis added ) . In effect , `` [ t ] he essence and elegance of the '276 patent is its exclusive use of changing conveyor speeds to create the gap necessary to buy time to unload the stacker . '' Marquip III at 10 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Marquip 's arguments focusing on the differences in sheet counting between Vermes and the '276 patent is only marginally , if at all , relevant . Rather , the determinative factor in the infringement analysis turns on whether the slowing of the conveyors is in response to the passage of the trailing end , as the claims recite , or in response to the interrupt mechanism , as Vermes teaches and as the Fosber device operates . Marquip does not show any genuine disputes of material fact to satisfy its burden `` to prove that the range of equivalents which it seeks would not ensnare the prior art . '' Wilson Sporting Goods , 904 F.2d at 685 ( `` The patent owner has always borne the burden of proving infringement . '' ( internal citations omitted ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , the district court properly held as a matter of law that the Fosber device and method does not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because it uses technology-an interrupt mechanism and changing conveyor speeds-already in the prior art . See Sage Prods. , Inc. v. Devon Indus. , Inc. , 126 F.3d 1420 , 1423 , 44 USPQ2d 1103 , 1106 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( `` Although equivalence is a factual matter normally reserved for a fact-finder , the trial court should grant summary judgment in any case where no reasonable fact-finder could find equivalence. '' ) . Accordingly , this court affirms the district court 's grant of Fosber 's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ On October 13 , 1998 , within a month of the district court 's decision on remand in Marquip III but more than one year after the initial decision in Marquip I , Marquip filed a Rule 60 ( b ) motion seeking relief from the final judgment of Marquip III in light of newly discovered evidence . Marquip alleged that Fosber withheld evidence about its device pertinent to infringement . Therefore , Marquip sought relief under Rule 60 ( b ) ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 6 ) , which states in pertinent part : _NEWLINE_ [ T ] he court may relieve a party or a party 's legal representative from a final judgment , order , or proceeding for the following reasons : _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) mistake , inadvertence , surprise , or excusable neglect ; _NEWLINE_ *1369 ( 2 ) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59 ( b ) ; _NEWLINE_ ( 3 ) fraud ... , misrepresentation , or other misconduct of an adverse party ; ... or _NEWLINE_ ( 6 ) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment . _NEWLINE_ The motion shall be made within a reasonable time , and for reasons ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) not more than one year after the judgment , order , or proceeding was entered or taken . _NEWLINE_ Fed.R.Civ.P . 60 ( b ) . In Marquip IV , the district court denied the Rule 60 ( b ) motion under subsections ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) as untimely because the motion was filed more than one year after the initial ruling in Marquip I . The district court also denied relief under subsection ( 6 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To review a purely procedural question not pertaining to patent law , such as a Rule 60 ( b ) motion , this court applies the rule of the regional circuit , in this case the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit . See Amstar Corp. v. Envirotech Corp. , 823 F.2d 1538 , 1550 , 3 USPQ2d 1412 , 1421 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ( `` Because denial of a Rule 60 ( b ) motion is a procedural issue not unique to patent law , we apply the rule of the regional circuit where appeals from the district court would normally lie . `` ) ; see also Midwest Industries , Inc. v. Karavan Trailers , Inc. , 175 F.3d 1356 , 1359 , 50 USPQ2d 1672 , 1675 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( en banc , in relevant part ) . The Seventh Circuit , and therefore this court , uses an abuse of discretion standard to assess the merits of Rule 60 ( b ) questions . See Money Store , Inc. v. Harriscorp Finance , Inc. , 885 F.2d 369 , 372 ( 7th Cir . 1994 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Upon review , this court detects no abuse of the district court 's broad discretion to apply Rule 60 ( b ) . As to the denial of relief under subsections ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) , the key issue is whether the one-year limitation is measured from the entry of final judgment in the initial trial or the remanded trial . The district court concluded that `` a review of the [ Rule 60 ( b ) ] motion and the nature of the previous judgments leads to the inescapable conclusion that [ Marquip ] is actually seeking relief from the final judgment of June 11 , 1997 entered outside the jurisdictional limit . '' Marquip IV at 6 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Without cases directly on point in the Seventh Circuit , the district court considered cases of other circuits addressing the effect of a remand on the timing of a Rule 60 ( b ) motion . In this case , the parties completed discovery before entry of the 1997 judgment in Marquip I . Also , Marquip recognizes that the newly discovered facts are critical to both Marquip I and its affirmance in Marquip III . Thus , the district court committed no reversible error in determining that the initial judgment in Marquip I is the appropriate measuring date for a Rule 60 ( b ) challenge . Marquip could have made a Rule 60 ( b ) motion on the same basis against the original judgment . See Amstar Corp. , 823 F.2d at 1550 ( rejecting a Rule 60 ( b ) motion as untimely because the motion related to issues of an earlier judgment before remand ) ; see Regional Properties , Inc. v. Financial & Real Estate Consulting Co. , 752 F.2d 178 , 184 ( 5th Cir . 1985 ) ( holding that `` [ t ] he date of the original judgment is the proper date of reference for consideration of [ the Rule ] 60 ( b ) motion '' ) ; Moolenaar v. Government of Virgin Islands , 822 F.2d 1342 , 1348 ( 3rd Cir . 1987 ) ( `` Although the motion was brought only six weeks after the district court 's judgment on remand , the reason for the attack upon that judgment was available for attack upon the original judgment ... . [ Thus , the Rule 60 ( b ) ] motion was 'not made within a reasonable time . ' `` ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Therefore , Marquip can not `` resurrect its literal infringement claims and expand them to claims not pursued prior to the 1997 judgment . '' Marquip IV at 9 . In light of the policy promoting the finality of judgments , this court finds no discernible abuse of discretion by the district court in *1370 denying the Rule 60 ( b ) motion under subsections ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying relief under subsection ( 6 ) . Marquip sought relief under this `` catch-all '' subsection without a time limitation . Relief under Rule 60 ( b ) ( 6 ) , however , is available only when the basis for relief does not fall within any of the categories specifically enumerated in Rule 60 ( b ) and when the circumstances are extraordinary . See Wesco Prods . Co. v. Alloy Automotive Co. , 880 F.2d 981 , 983 ( 7th Cir . 1989 ) ( `` [ I ] f the asserted grounds for relief fall within the terms of the first three clauses of Rule 60 ( b ) , relief under the catchall provision is not available . The rationale underlying this principle is that the one year time limit applicable to the first three clauses of Rule 60 ( b ) would be meaningless if relief was also available under the catchall provision . `` ) ; Pioneer Inv . Servs . Co. v. Brunswick Assoc . Ltd. Partnership , 507 U.S. 380 , 393 , 113 S.Ct . 1489 , 123 L.Ed.2d 74 ( 1993 ) ( `` To justify relief under subsection ( 6 ) , a party must show 'extraordinary circumstances ' suggesting that the party is faultless in delay. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , Marquip satisfies neither requirement . First , the basis for Marquip 's motion could have fallen under Rule 60 ( b ) ( 2 ) as newly discovered evidence or Rule 60 ( b ) ( 3 ) as misrepresentation or misconduct by Fosber . Second , although Fosber may have `` engaged in gamesmanship by strategically limiting disclosures based on an unreasonably narrow interpretation of [ Marquip 's ] discovery requests , '' the district court found no evidence of `` false responses to discovery requests . '' Marquip IV at 11 . Based on this record , this court finds that the district court did not abuse its discretion . Fosber 's behavior does not rise to the level of `` extraordinary circumstances '' necessary to invoke subsection ( 6 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ Because the Fosber device falls within the prior art , this court affirms the district court 's grant of Fosber 's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . Additionally , this court also affirms the district court 's denial of Marquip 's motion under Rule 60 ( b ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ Each party shall bear its own costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 198 F.3d 1363 , 53 U.S.P.Q.2d 1015

Banner as Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks1 authorizing the Commissioner to issue to appellee a patent containing claims 1 , 2 , and 3 of patent application serial No . 598,935 for `` TITANIUM ALLOY . '' The Commissioner has appealed . We reverse . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Background _NEWLINE_ The inventors , Loren C. Covington and Howard R. Palmer , employees of appellee to whom they have assigned their invention and the application thereon , filed an application on March 29 , 1974 , serial No . 455,964 , to patent an alloy they developed . The application involved on this appeal is a continuation-in-part thereof , filed July 25 , 1975 , containing the three claims on appeal . The alloy is made primarily of titanium ( Ti ) and contains small amounts of nickel ( Ni ) and molybdenum ( Mo ) as alloying ingredients to give the alloy certain desirable properties , particularly corrosion resistance in hot brine solutions , while retaining workability so that articles such as tubing can be fabricated from it by rolling , welding and other techniques . The inventors apparently also found that iron content should be limited , iron being an undesired impurity rather than an alloying ingredient . They determined the permissible ranges of the components , above and below which the desired properties were not obtained . A precise definition of the invention sought to be patented is found in the claims , set forth below , claim 3 representing the preferred composition , it being understood , however , that no iron at all would be even more preferred . _NEWLINE_ 1 . A titanium base alloy consisting essentially by weight of about 0.6 % to 0.9 % nickel , 0.2 % to 0.4 % molybdenum , up to 0.2 % maximum iron , balance titanium , said alloy being characterized by good corrosion resistance in hot brine environments . _NEWLINE_ 2 . A titanium base alloy as set forth in Claim 1 having up to 0.1 % iron , balance titanium . _NEWLINE_ 3 . A titanium base alloy as set forth in Claim 1 having 0.8 % nickel , 0.3 % molybdenum , up to 0.1 % maximum iron , balance titanium . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The examiner 's final rejection , repeated in his Answer on appeal to the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) Board of Appeals ( board ) , was on the grounds that claims 1 and 2 are anticipated ( fully met ) by , and claim 3 would have been obvious from , an article by Kalabukhova and Mikheyew , Investigation of the Mechanical Properties of Ti-Mo-Ni Alloys , Russian Metallurgy ( Metally ) No . 3 , pages 130-133 ( 1970 ) ( in the court below and hereinafter called `` the Russian article '' ) under 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 102 and 103 , respectively . The board affirmed the examiner 's rejection . However , it mistakenly proceeded on the assumption that all three claims had been rejected as anticipated under ¡± 102 by the Russian article and ignored the obviousness rejection . On this appeal the PTO says it does not pursue the ¡± 103 rejection further . Appellee proceeds on the basis that only the ¡± 102 rejection is before us . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Both the examiner and the board had before them as evidence three affidavits by Rosenberg , Palmer , and Hall and a declaration by Minkler , by which they were not persuaded of patentability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Russian article is short ( 3 pages ) , highly technical , and contains 10 graphs as part of the discussion . As its title indicates , it relates to ternary Ti-Mo-Ni alloys , the subject of the application at bar . The examiner and the board both found that it would disclose to one skilled in the art an *777 alloy on which at least claims 1 and 2 read , so that those claims would not be allowable under the statute because of lack of novelty of their subject matter . Since the article does not specifically disclose such an alloy in words , a little thinking is required about what it would disclose to one knowledgeable about Ti-Ni-Mo alloys . The PTO did that thinking as follows : _NEWLINE_ Figure lc [ a graph ] shows data for the ternary titanium alloy which contains Mo and Ni in the ratio of 1:3 . Amongst the actual points on the graph is one at 1 % Mo + Ni . At this point , the amounts of Mo and Ni would be 0.25 % and 0.75 % respectively . A similar point appears on the graph shown in Figure 2 of the article . _NEWLINE_ ... . _NEWLINE_ Appellants do not deny that the data points are disclosed in the reference . In fact , the Hall affidavit indicates at least two specific points ( at 1 % and 1.25 % Mo + Ni ) which would represent a description of alloys falling within the scope of the instant claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On that basis , the board found that the claimed alloys were not new , because they were disclosed in the prior art . It having been argued that the Russian article contains no disclosure of corrosion-resistant properties of any of the alloys , the board held : _NEWLINE_ The fact that a particular property or the end use for this alloy as contemplated by appellants was not recognized in the article is of no consequence . _NEWLINE_ It therefore held the Russian article to be an anticipation , noting that although the article does not discuss corrosion resistance , it does disclose other properties such as strength and ductility . The PTO further points out that the authors of the reference must have made the alloys to obtain the data points . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Being dissatisfied with the decision of the board , Titanium Metals Corporation of America , as assignee of the Covington and Palmer application , then brought an action in the District Court for the District of Columbia against the Commissioner pursuant to 35 U.S.C . ¡± 145 , its complaint alleging that the board 's decision `` was erroneous and contrary to law , '' and making profert of a certified copy of the application and all papers in the file thereof , together with a copy of the Russian article which was the sole basis of the PTO refusal to allow the claims . It prayed that the court adjudge it entitled to a patent containing claims 1-3 and authorize the Commissioner to grant such a patent . The Commissioner filed an answer denying that the applicants were the first inventors of the alloys claimed or entitled to a patent , alleging that the claims are not patentable under the law , and making profert of the Examiner 's Answer , the Board of Appeals ' decision , and the prior art reference . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The case came on for trial on January 24 , 1980 , before the Honorable John G. Penn and was concluded in two and a half hours . The testimony of one witness was heard by the court , Dr. James C. Williams , professor at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and an expert in titanium metallurgy . His testimony was about equally divided between direct and cross examination . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the conclusion of the plaintiff 's case , the following exchange took place between the judge and the Associate Solicitor for the PTO : _NEWLINE_ THE COURT : All right . Mr. Tarring ? _NEWLINE_ MR. TARRING : Your Honor , generally the position of the Patent Office is we rely on the position of the tribunals below , the examiner and the Board of Appeals and their decisions are both present in the exhibit which I submitted earlier . I was not quite sure whether you would prefer that we have a post-trial brief in the matter . If that 's your preference we could do that or I could make an argument on the basis of the law right now . I do n't know what your preference would be . Otherwise , I 'm not going to call any witnesses . _NEWLINE_ THE COURT : You are not going to what ? _NEWLINE_ MR. TARRING : I have no intention of calling any witnesses so it 's really a matter of argument at this point , I think . _NEWLINE_ *778 THE COURT : Of course , I have received your pre-trial briefs . _NEWLINE_ After further discussion , it was settled that both parties would file further briefs after the hearing transcript had been prepared . They were filed in April and May , 1980 . On November 16 , 1984 , the District Court entered the Order appealed from followed on November 28 by a supporting memorandum opinion . January 10 , 1985 , the PTO filed its Notice of Appeal . This court has heard oral argument and received briefs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The District Court Opinion _NEWLINE_ The trial court 's memorandum opinion2 having been published , we shall merely outline its contents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After stating the nature of the action and the relief sought , Part I is a summarization of the contents of the patent specification , a statement of the issues , and of the PTO rejection which is stated both correctly as the examiner made it and incorrectly as the board assumed it to be . Part II is a statement of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ' attitude toward plaintiff 's burden on review of the PTO board decisions in ¡± 145 actions , namely , that it is a `` heavy burden , '' `` great weight '' being given to the PTO decision because of its `` expertise , '' a `` thorough conviction '' that it erred being required , as well as a lack of a `` rational basis for its conclusions . '' In Part III is a brief discussion of `` anticipation '' under ¡± 102 with citation of two cases from our predecessor Court of Customs and Patent Appeals , In re Wilder , 429 F.2d 447 , 57 C.C.P.A . 1314 , 166 UPSQ 545 ( 1970 ) , and In re LeGrice , 301 F.2d 929 , 49 C.C.P.A . 1124 , 133 USPQ 365 ( 1962 ) , with emphasis placed on their holdings that an anticipatory reference must be an `` enabling '' reference , the implication being that the Russian article perhaps does not enable one to know all the things that the plaintiff 's inventors disclosed in their application , such as the range limits of the alloying ingredients Mo and Ni and the corrosion resistance . The court then states that after considering all of the affidavit and declaration evidence which was before the PTO , it still lacked the necessary `` thorough conviction '' required to overturn the PTO decision even though , left to its own judgment of the evidence , it would be willing to do so . It then reviewed the evidence of Dr. Williams taken before it . Dr. Williams was qualified as an expert in titanium metallurgy but not in patent law . The questions he was asked , however , pertained to the interpretation of patent claims , as quoted in the court 's opinion . The court was of the view that his testimony `` fully supports the arguments made by the plaintiff in this case '' and found it `` to be very persuasive . '' The court then concluded that claims 1-3 were not anticipated and that claim 3 was wrongly rejected as directed to obvious subject matter . In the court 's view , Dr. Williams ' testimony tipped the scales in favor of issuing a patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ OPINION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . Jurisdiction _NEWLINE_ This suit was brought in the district court pursuant to 35 U.S.C . ¡± 145 . Our jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 4 ) ( C ) which provides as follows : _NEWLINE_ ¡± 1295 . Jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit _NEWLINE_ ( a ) The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction- _NEWLINE_ ... . _NEWLINE_ ( 4 ) of an appeal from a decision of- _NEWLINE_ ... . _NEWLINE_ ( C ) a district court to which a case was directed pursuant to section 145 or 146 of title 35 ; ... . _NEWLINE_ This case having been directed to the District Court for the District of Columbia by ¡± 145 , this court 's jurisdiction is exclusive of the Court of Appeals for the District of *779 Columbia and is therefore governed by the precedents of this court and its predecessor courts . See South Corporation v. United States , 690 F.2d 1368 , 215 USPQ 657 ( Fed.Cir.1982 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Strange as it may seem to any district judge not to be governed by the precedents of his own Court of Appeals , that is the situation created by Congress in the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 , ¡± 402 of Pub.L . 97-164 , Apr . 2 , 1982 , 96 Stat . 37 , effective Oct. 1 , 1982 , in the interest of promoting a uniform patent law by having only one Court of Appeals deciding questions of patent law , whether review be of decisions of the Patent and Trademark Office or of district court judgments in cases arising under the patent laws of the United States . Cf . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . We do not fault the district judge , however , for having stated the precedents of his own circuit in this ¡± 145 case because this is one of the first occasions we have had to review a judgment in such a case . Nor do we need to determine whether we should apply those precedents here . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . The rejections under review _NEWLINE_ Tracing the PTO rejections under review below , we encounter confusion . Although we are reviewing the judgment ( in the form of an order ) of the district court,3 the effect of that order is to hold that the PTO 's rejections of claims 1-3 were in error . The actual holding of the district court was : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Court concludes that Claims 1 , 2 and 3 should not have been rejected on the basis of anticipation pursuant to 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 . Moreover , the Court concludes that Claim 3 should not have been rejected as being obvious pursuant to 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . _NEWLINE_ Thus , the Court finds as a fact and concludes as a matter of law that the decision of the Board of Appeals was in error . The testimony of Dr. Williams , which remains uncontradicted , adds sufficient weight to the plaintiff 's side to tip the scales and , in the Court 's view , to result in clear and convincing evidence that the application should not have been rejected . _NEWLINE_ Thus , the court deemed all three claims to have been rejected for anticipation under ¡± 102 . The examiner never so rejected claim 3 . The board opinion , as above noted , erroneously assumed that he had , never gave any special or separate attention to claim 3 , never discussed obviousness or ¡± 103 , and concluded its opinion with the words `` The decision of the examiner is affirmed . '' The board made no new rejection , as it might have done , under 37 C.F.R . ¡± 196 ( b ) . Under these circumstances , we shall assume that the board intended to , and did , affirm only the rejection that the examiner had made , as we have stated at the beginning , and that the only rejection outstanding against claim 3 is for obviousness under ¡± 103 . _NEWLINE_ The district court assumed there were two outstanding rejections against claim 3 . We have reduced it to one . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The appellee , because it quite evidently suits its argument best , has preferred to ignore the ¡± 103 rejection of claim 3 , but we do not because it exists in the official record . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The PTO brief says the Commissioner `` is not pursuing '' the ¡± 103 rejection in this court , but it is before us whether or not pursued by the PTO . The PTO Solicitor developed a new theory in his brief , never propounded by either the examiner or the board , to support a ¡± 102 rejection of claim 3 on the Russian article,4 but that *780 was clearly beyond his province and we disregard it as amounting to a new ground of rejection . We also disregard it as contrary to many holdings of this court and its predecessors that anticipation under ¡± 102 can be found only when the reference discloses exactly what is claimed and that where there are differences between the reference disclosure and the claim , the rejection must be based on ¡± 103 which takes differences into account . D. Chisum , Patents ¡± 3.02 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have undertaken to settle the question whether we are dealing with one ground of rejection or two for the further reason that the standard of review of this court may vary in accordance with what the rejection is and whether it is considered to be a finding of fact or a conclusion of law . We have held that anticipation is a finding of fact , reviewable under the `` clearly erroneous '' standard , Shatterproof Glass Corp. v. Libbey-Owens Ford Co. , 758 F.2d 613 , 225 USPQ 634 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) , and that obviousness is a conclusion of law not subject to that restraint , but is freely reviewable . Gardner v. TEC Systems , Inc. , 725 F.2d 1338 , 1344 , 220 USPQ 777 , 782 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . That may make a difference in our review . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 . The merits _NEWLINE_ Finding , as we do , that claim 3 was never purposefully rejected under ¡± 102 , both the board and the district court being confused about that fact , we are left with the propriety of the rejection of claims 1 and 2 under ¡± 102 and the rejection of claim 3 under ¡± 103 , both rejections having been held by the district court to have been erroneous . That necessarily follows from the court 's conclusion `` that the Claims are patentable . '' We find that conclusion contrary to statutory law and will deal with the two grounds of rejection separately . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Anticipation , ¡± 102 _NEWLINE_ From consideration of the trial court 's memorandum opinion , we are unable to determine whether it erred because of miscontruction of the claims , misreading of what the reference discloses , lack of proper advice on the requirements of the patent statute respecting patentability , or the technical legal meaning of `` anticipation , '' a term which some courts have erroneously used from time to time . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We are left in no doubt that the court was impressed by the totality of the evidence that the applicants for patent had discovered or invented and disclosed knowledge which is not to be found in the reference , nor do we have any doubt about that ourselves . But those facts are beside the point . The patent law imposes certain fundamental conditions for patentability , paramount among them being the condition that what is sought to be patented , as determined by the claims , be new . The basic provision of Title 35 applicable here is ¡± 101 , providing in relevant part : `` Whoever invents or discovers any new ... composition of matter , or any new ... improvement thereof , may obtain a patent therefor , subject to the conditions and requirements of this title . '' ( Emphasis ours . ) The title of the application here involved is `` Titanium Alloy , '' a composition of matter . Surprisingly , in all of the evidence , nobody discussed the key issue of whether the alloy was new , which is the essence of the anticipation issue , including the expert Dr. Williams . Plaintiff 's counsel , bringing Dr. Williams ' testimony to its climax , after he had explained the nature of the ingredients , the alloys made therefrom , and their superior corrosion resistance in hot brine , *781 etc. , repetitively asked him such questions as `` Does the [ Russian ] article direct you as one skilled in the art to a titanium alloy having nickel present in an amount between .6 and .9 percent molybdenum in an amount between .2 and .4 percent ? '' ( emphasis ours ) followed by `` Is there anything mentioned in the article about corrosion resistance ? '' Of course , the answers were emphatically negative . But this and like testimony does not deal with the critical question : do claims 1 and 2 , to which the questions obviously relate , read on or encompass an alloy which was already known by reason of the disclosure of the Russian article ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Section 102 , the usual basis for rejection for lack of novelty or anticipation , lays down certain principles for determining the novelty required by ¡± 101 , among which are the provisions in ¡± 102 ( a ) and ( b ) that the claimed invention has not been `` described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country , '' either ( a ) before the invention by the applicant or ( b ) more than one year before the application date to which he is entitled ( strictly a `` loss of right '' provision similar to novelty ) . Either provision applies in this case , the Russian article having a date some 5 years prior to the filing date and its status as `` prior art '' not being questioned . The PTO was never specific as to what part of ¡± 102 applies , merely rejecting on ¡± 102 . The question , therefore , is whether claims 1 and 2 encompass and , if allowed , would enable plaintiff-appellee to exclude others from making , using , or selling an alloy described in the Russian article . See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 154 . Kalman v. Kimberly-Clark Corp. , 713 F.2d 760 , 218 USPQ 781 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To answer the question we need only turn to the affidavit of James A . Hall , a metallurgist employed by appellee 's TIMET Division , who undertook to analyze the Russian article disclosure by calculating the ingredient percentages shown in the graph data points , which he presented in tabular form . There are 15 items in his table . The second item shows a titanium base alloy containing 0.25 % by weight Mo and 0.75 % Ni and this is squarely within the ranges of 0.2-0.4 % Mo and 0.6-0.9 % Ni of claims 1 and 2 . As to that disclosed alloy of the prior art , there can be no question that claims 1 and 2 read on it and would be infringed by anyone making , using , or selling it . Therefore , the statute prohibits a patent containing them . This seems to be a case either of not adequately considering the novelty requirement of the statute , the true meaning of the correlative term `` anticipation , '' or the meaning of the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ By reason of the court 's quotations from cases holding that a reference is not an anticipation which does not enable one skilled in the art to practice the claimed invention , it appears that the trial court thought there was some deficiency in the Russian article on that score . Enablement in this case involves only being able to make the alloy , given the ingredients and their proportions without more . The evidence here , however , clearly answers that question in two ways . Appellee 's own patent application does not undertake to tell anyone how to make the alloy it describes and seeks to patent . It assumes that those skilled in the art would know how . Secondly , appellee 's expert , Dr. Williams , testified on cross examination that given the alloy information in the Russian article , he would know how to prepare the alloys `` by at least three techniques . '' Enablement is not a problem in this case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As we read the situation , the court was misled by the arguments and evidence to the effect that the inventors here found out and disclosed in their application many things that one can not learn from reading the Russian article and that this was sufficient in law to justify granting them a patent for their contributions-such things as what good corrosion resistance the claimed alloys have against hot brine , which possibly was not known , and the range limits of the Ni and Mo content , outside of which that resistance diminishes , which are teachings of very useful information . These things the applicants teach the art and the Russian article does not . Indeed , appellee 's counsel argued in his opening *782 statement to the trial court that the PTO 's refusal of a patent was `` directly contrary to the requirement of Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution , '' which authorizes Congress to create a patent law . But throughout the trial counsel never came to grips with the real issues : ( 1 ) what do the claims cover and ( 2 ) is what they cover new ? Under the laws Congress wrote , they must be considered . Congress has not seen fit to permit the patenting of an old alloy , known to others through a printed publication , by one who has discovered its corrosion resistance or other useful properties , or has found out to what extent one can modify the composition of the alloy without losing such properties . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is also possible that the trial court did not properly interpret the claims and took them to be directed only to the applicants ' discoveries about the properties of the alloys instead of to the alloys themselves , as they are , possibly because of the phrase at the end of claim 1 , `` characterized by good corrosion resistance in hot brine environments , '' which applies to the other two dependent claims also . No light is shed by its opinion on what the court thought the claims mean as the opinion does not construe the claims . Until it has been definitely determined what subject matter is being claimed , it is not known what it is that the PTO held to be unpatentable . Claim interpretation , which is the logical starting point of the analysis , is a question of law free from the clearly erroneous standard of review . Raytheon Co. v. Roper Corp. , 724 F.2d 951 , 956 , 220 USPQ 592 , 596 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . It is the correct and necessary construction of all three claims that they simply define titanium base alloys . Claims 1 and 2 state certain narrow limits within which the alloying ingredients , Mo and Ni , are present and necessarily cover a number of alloys . Claim 3 is specific to a single alloy . This said , it is immaterial , on the issue of their novelty , what inherent properties the alloys have or whether these applicants discovered certain inherent properties . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The trial court and appellee have relied on In re Wilder , supra , but they have both failed to note those portions of that opinion most relevant to the present case . The issue there , as here , was anticipation of certain claims . Wilder argued `` that even though there may be a technical anticipation , the discovery of the new property and the recitation of this property in the claims 'lends patentable novelty ' to the claims . '' The court answered : _NEWLINE_ However , recitation , in a claim to a composition , of a particular property said to be possessed by the recited composition , be that property newly-discovered or not , does not necessarily change the scope of the subject matter otherwise defined by that claim . [ 429 F.2d at 450 , 57 C.C.P.A . 1314 , 166 UPSQ at 548 . ] _NEWLINE_ The court in that case also said : _NEWLINE_ [ W ] e start with the proposition that claims can not be obtained to that which is not new . This was the basis of the holding in In re Thuau [ 135 F.2d 344 , 30 C.C.P.A . 979 , 57 USPQ 324 ( CCPA 1943 ) ] . It was the law then , is now and will be until Congress decrees otherwise . [ Id . ] _NEWLINE_ It is also an elementary principle of patent law that when , as by a recitation of ranges or otherwise , a claim covers several compositions , the claim is `` anticipated '' if one of them is in the prior art . In re Petering , 301 F.2d 676 , 682 , 49 C.C.P.A . 993 , 1001 , 133 USPQ 275 , 280 ( 1962 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For all of the foregoing reasons , the court below committed clear error and legal error in authorizing the issuance of a patent on claims 1 and 2 since , properly construed , they are anticipated under ¡± 102 by the Russian article which admittedly discloses an alloy on which these claims read . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B. Obviousness , ¡± 103 _NEWLINE_ Little more need be said in support of the examiner 's rejection of claim 3 , affirmed by the board , on the ground that its more specific subject matter would have been obvious at the time the invention was *783 made from the knowledge disclosed in the reference . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As admitted by appellee 's affidavit evidence from James A . Hall , the Russian article discloses two alloys having compositions very close to that of claim 3 , which is 0.3 % Mo and 0.8 % Ni , balance titanium . The two alloys in the prior art have 0.25 % Mo-0.75 % Ni and 0.31 % Mo-0.94 % Ni , respectively . The proportions are so close that prima facie one skilled in the art would have expected them to have the same properties . Appellee produced no evidence to rebut that prima facie case . The specific alloy of claim 3 must therefore be considered to have been obvious from known alloys . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Conclusion _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , the decision and order of the district court holding that claims 1 , 2 , and 3 are directed to patentable subject matter and authorizing the issuance of a patent thereon were clearly erroneous and are reversed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 778 F.2d 775 , 227 U.S.P.Q . 773 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After suit was brought and before entry of said Order , Commissioner Gerald J.

Inasmuch as this claim specifies the content of nickel and molybdenum to a tenth of a percent , the claim , given the broadest reasonable interpretation , would cover alloys the amounts of whose contents would correspond to the claim language when expressed in tenths of a percent . Following the usual convention of rounding off hundredths to tenths by increasing the tenths digit by one when the hundredths digit to be dropped is five or greater , the alloy of the Russian article , expressed in tenths of a percent , would contain 0.8 % nickel , 0.3 % molybdenum and balance titanium , corresponding to the alloy specified in tenths of a percent in claim 3 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

Des . 344,144 ( the '144 patent ) is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct in its prosecution . The district court so held.1 Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding the '144 patent unenforceable , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Elk Corporation of Dallas ( Elk ) brought a patent infringement action against defendants , GAF Building Corporation of America , Building Materials Corporation of America , Building Materials Corporation of America d/b/a GAF Materials Corporation , and GAF Materials Corporation ( collectively , GAF ) , alleging that GAF infringed Elk 's '144 patent . GAF counterclaimed by filing for a declaratory judgment that Elk 's design patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by the patent applicants and their patent attorney in the prosecution of the patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Elk and GAF are manufacturers of roofing shingles . In 1975 , GAF obtained a patent , U.S. Patent No . 3,921,358 ( the Bettoli patent ) , for two-ply , composite roofing shingles which are often referred to as `` laminated shingles . '' GAF granted licenses under the Bettoli patent to many manufacturers , including Elk , to manufacture and sell two-ply , composite roofing shingles . In the late 1980s four inventors , some of whom were Elk employees , began developing a two-ply , composite roofing shingle based on the Bettoli patent that utilized striations of shading to simulate the appearance of depth . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In anticipation of applying for a design patent on the new shingle , Casimir Weaver , one of the inventors , arranged for a patentability search on the newly developed roofing shingle . In his letter requesting the search , Mr. Weaver acknowledged the similarity of the new design to the shingles disclosed in the Bettoli patent : _NEWLINE_ The enclosed sketch describes this [ new ] product 's appearance . This shingle 's construction is similar to the one described in Bettoli 's patent No . 3,921,358 which is also enclosed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A search was made and Mr. Weaver was sent a search report . One of the patents discussed in the search report was U.S. Patent No . 2,036,329 ( the Giles patent ) . After reviewing the search report , Mr. Weaver wrote a memo to a co-inventor pointing out that the Giles patent was `` [ o ] f special interest . '' The search report and Mr. Weaver 's memo were forwarded to a patent attorney at Baker & Botts , L.L.P.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *30 During the prosecution of the '144 patent , a number of prior art patents covering different shingles or parts of shingles , including U.S. Patent . No . Des . 309,027 ( the Noone patent ) , U.S. Patent No . 3,613,328 ( the Morgan patent ) , and U.S. Patent . No . 2,253,652 ( the Ritter patent ) , were disclosed to the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) . Neither the Noone patent , the Morgan patent , nor the Ritter patent made mention of either the Bettoli patent or the Giles patent . The Bettoli and Giles patents , themselves , were never disclosed to the PTO despite the fact that it was the standard practice of the patent attorney who completed the prosecution of the '144 patent to disclose all of the prior art cited in a search report . In contrast , during the prosecution of a continuation of the '144 patent , both the Bettoli and Giles patents were disclosed to the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In its counterclaim , GAF alleged that the applicants had committed fraud on the PTO by various means , including by intentionally withholding the Bettoli and Giles patents and by proffering arguments to the examiner during the prosecution of the '144 patent that could not have been made had the Bettoli and Giles patents been disclosed . In addition , GAF alleged that the applicants had intentionally withheld their knowledge of a commercialized Bettoli-type shingle known as the GS High Sierra . The district court found , inter alia , that the Bettoli and Giles patents and information about the GS High Sierra were material , that the applicants had knowledge of the materiality of the patents and information , and that they withheld the patents and information from the PTO with an intent to deceive . See Elk Corp. v. Building Materials Corp. , No . 3:94-CV-0249-P , slip op . at 10 , 14 , 27-28 , 1997 WL 796004 ( N.D.Tex . Oct. 10 , 1997 ) . In addition , the district court found that in order to overcome an initial rejection the applicants had made arguments concerning the prior art cited by the examiner that could not have been made had they disclosed the far more material Bettoli and Giles patents . See id . at 20 . In light of all the circumstances , the district court concluded that the applicants ' conduct was so culpable that Elk 's '144 patent should not be enforced . See id . at 28 . Elk appeals the district court 's final judgment against it . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ Applicants for patents , including their patent attorneys , are required to prosecute patent applications in the PTO with candor , good faith , and honesty . See Molins PLC v. Textron , Inc. , 48 F.3d 1172 , 1178 , 33 USPQ2d 1823 , 1826 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ; see also 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 . A breach of this duty may constitute inequitable conduct . Although the district court considered multiple allegations that the applicants had breached their duty of candor , we focus on the most pertinent allegations - those that involve the withholding of the Bettoli and Giles patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Inequitable conduct due to failure to disclose material information must be proven by clear and convincing evidence of : ( 1 ) prior art that was material ; ( 2 ) knowledge chargeable to an applicant of that prior art and of its materiality ; and ( 3 ) failure of the applicant to disclose the art resulting from an intent to mislead the PTO . See Molins , 48 F.3d at 1178 , 33 USPQ2d at 1827 ; FMC Corp. v. Manitowoc Co. , 835 F.2d 1411 , 1415 , 5 USPQ2d 1112 , 1115 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) . Such proof of inequitable conduct may be rebutted by a showing that : ( a ) the prior art was not material ; ( b ) if the prior art was material , a showing that the applicant did not know of that art ; ( c ) if the applicant did know of that art , a showing that the applicant did not know of its materiality ; or ( d ) a showing that the applicant 's failure to disclose the art did not result from an intent to mislead the PTO . See id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because inequitable conduct is an equitable issue committed to the discretion of the district court , we review a determination of inequitable conduct for abuse of discretion . See Kingsdown Med . Consultants , Ltd. v. Hollister , Inc. , 863 F.2d 867 , 876 , 9 USPQ2d 1384 , 1392 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( en banc ) . We may reverse a district court 's decision on inequitable conduct only if the decision is based upon `` clearly erroneous findings of fact or on a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law , or evidences a clear error of judgment on the part of the district court . '' Id . ; Molins , 48 F.3d at 1178 , 33 USPQ2d at 1827 . The district court 's factual *31 determinations of materiality and intent are subject to the clearly erroneous standard and will not be disturbed unless this court has a `` definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On the question of whether the prior art Bettoli and Giles patents were material , Elk argues that the district court erred in finding the Bettoli and Giles patents material because they were merely cumulative of certain patents that were disclosed to the PTO during the prosecution of the '144 patent . According to Elk , the Bettoli patent was merely cumulative of the Morgan and Noone patents , and the Giles patent was merely cumulative of the Ritter and Noone patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Information is `` material '' when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable examiner would have considered the information important in deciding whether to allow the application to issue as a patent . See Molins , 48 F.3d at 1179 , 33 USPQ2d at 1827 . However , an otherwise material reference need not be disclosed if it is merely cumulative of or less material than other references already disclosed . See Halliburton Co. v. Schlumberger Technology Corp. , 925 F.2d 1435 , 1440 , 17 USPQ2d 1834 , 1839 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ; Baxter Int ' l , Inc. v. McGaw , Inc. , 149 F.3d 1321 , 1328 , 47 USPQ2d 1225 , 1229 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Differences between the Bettoli patent and the Morgan and Noone patents support the district court 's finding that the Bettoli patent was material . For instance , the Morgan patent , which predates the Bettoli patent , discloses a different type of shingle , a single-ply , strip shingle , than the two-ply , composite shingle disclosed in the Bettoli patent . In addition , the Noone patent , a design patent covering the ornamental design for only the tab portion of a single-ply strip shingle , could not be cumulative of the Bettoli patent which describes an entire two-ply composite shingle . Because the Morgan and Noone patents disclose a different shingle , the Bettoli patent is not cumulative of those patents . In addition , the Bettoli patent is not less material than the Morgan or Noone patents because the design claimed in the '144 patent is for a two-ply , composite shingle , not a single-ply , strip shingle . Thus , the district court did not clearly err in finding that the Bettoli patent was the most material prior art and that the Bettoli patent was not cumulative of the Morgan and Noone patents which were cited to the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Similarly , differences between the Giles patent and the Ritter and Noone patents support the district court 's finding that the Giles patent was material . The Giles patent discloses shingles with blended horizontal shadings across each simulated shingle , whereas the Ritter patent discloses a discrete , continuous dark line across the tops of shingles . The Noone patent is also different from the Giles patent because it teaches discrete vertical zones of shading . Thus , because neither the Noone patent nor the Ritter patent discloses the same shading as the Giles patent , the Giles patent can not be cumulative of those patents . In addition , the Giles patent is not less material than the Ritter or Noone patents because the design claimed in the '144 patent for laminated shingles with three horizontal striations that appear to blend into each other across a simulated shingle is more similar to the blended shading of shingles in the Giles patent than the shadings in the Ritter or Noone patents . Thus , the district court did not clearly err in finding that the Giles patent was material and was not cumulative of the Ritter and Noone patents which were cited to the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Besides the prior art disclosed to the PTO , the district court also considered other circumstances relating to the materiality of the Bettoli and Giles patents and the applicants ' knowledge of those patents . With respect to the Bettoli patent , there was evidence that the applicants ' new shingle design was an improved Bettoli-type laminated roofing shingle ; that Mr. Weaver 's letter , requesting a search report , revealed that the applicants knew that the new shingle was very similar to the shingle disclosed in the Bettoli patent ; and that the testimony of the prosecuting attorney indicated that there was a strong likelihood the prosecuting attorney also knew of the materiality of the Bettoli patent . These factors further support the district court 's findings of the high level of materiality of the Bettoli patent and the applicants ' knowledge of that materiality . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *32 With regard to the Giles patent , additional support for the district court 's findings of materiality and knowledge are found in the search report and in Mr. Weaver 's memo to a co-inventor . The search report , which was reviewed by both Mr. Weaver and the prosecuting attorney , listed and discussed the Giles patent . In addition , Mr. Weaver 's memo contained his admission that the Giles patent was important . Based upon the foregoing , the district court 's findings of materiality and knowledge of materiality of the Bettoli and Giles patents were not clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With regard to the intent of the applicants to deceive the PTO , our precedent has recognized that intent need not , and rarely can , be proven by direct evidence . See Merck & Co. v. Danbury Pharmacal , Inc. , 873 F.2d 1418 , 1422 , 10 USPQ2d 1682 , 1686 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . Rather , this element of inequitable conduct must generally be inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the applicants ' overall conduct . See Paragon Podiatry Laboratory , Inc. v. KLM Laboratories , Inc. , 984 F.2d 1182 , 1190 , 25 USPQ2d 1561 , 1567 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) ; Merck , 873 F.2d at 1422 , 10 USPQ2d at 1686 . Moreover , we have recognized that the more material the omission , the less the degree of intent that must be shown to reach a conclusion of inequitable conduct . See Critikon , Inc. v. Becton Dickinson Vascular Access , Inc. , 120 F.3d 1253 , 1256 , 43 USPQ2d 1666 , 1668 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ; Akzo N.V. v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 808 F.2d 1471 , 1481-82 , 1 USPQ2d 1241 , 1247 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) . In light of all the circumstances of the case , as described above , we can not say that the district court 's finding of intent to mislead was clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , given the factual findings on which the district court 's judgment stands , we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the behavior of the applicants and their prosecuting attorney constituted inequitable conduct . Accordingly , the district court 's judgment that Elk 's '144 patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct is _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 168 F.3d 28 , 49 U.S.P.Q.2d 1853 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Elk Corp. v.

This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( 1988 ) to entertain Opticon 's appeal . Because no reversible error was committed , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ The patents relate to devices that employ lasers to read bar code symbols , and methods of their use . The application that issued as the '297 patent was filed on February 29 , 1980 . In the first official action , the examiner required restriction to one of seven species identified as Groups I-VII . The applicants elected Group I claims directed to a light-weight laser scanning head , which matured into the '297 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '297 patent specification refers to two types of previously known laser scanning devices . The first type , often mounted in supermarket and other checkout counters , requires a user to bring the symbol-bearing object to the stationary scanner . Its usefulness is limited to decoding symbols on objects that can be brought to the device . The second type uses a wand or pen that emits a scanning laser beam . The user places the pen in physical contact with the object , then manually drags the pen across the symbol . This second type requires user training because successful decoding depends on pen angle , pressure , and speed of passage as the pen is dragged across the bar code . Multiple passes of the pen are often required to achieve a single reading . Moreover , the tips of pen scanners tend to scar the bar codes and are not useful on wax coated containers , such as milk cartons , on soft products , such as bagged potato chips , or on reflective aluminum cans . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In contrast , the invention claimed in the '297 patent is a portable , light-weight laser scanning head that operates without physical contact with the bar code . See Figure 1 . In gun-like fashion , the user sights the bar code , unobstructed by the device , then depresses a trigger to initiate decoding . Each time the trigger is depressed , the hand-held device sweeps a scanning laser beam laterally across the bar code by use of mirrors . The examiner considered this `` aim and shoot '' feature to be a novel distinguishing characteristic of the claimed invention over the prior art . All of the asserted '297 patent claims depend on claim 1 , reprinted in the Appendix , which in pertinent part claims the `` aim and shoot '' feature as : _NEWLINE_ ( c ) miniature optic means ... to permit the user to conveniently register the laser light beam on the symbol by sighting the symbol along a direct line of sight which does not pass through the housing ; _NEWLINE_ ( d ) miniature scanning means mounted in the light path and in the interior space of the housing for cyclically sweeping the laser light beam across the bar code symbol for reflection therefrom ; _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * * * * _NEWLINE_ ( h ) handle means for normally supporting the light-weight laser scanning head in a non-contacting relationship with the symbol during reading thereof ; and _NEWLINE_ *1573 ( i ) manually actuatable trigger means on the housing for initiating reading of the symbol each time the trigger means is manually actuated by the user . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ -- -- - _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Before the '297 patent issued , the applicants filed a divisional application directed to the originally non-elected Group VI claims , described in the restriction as a `` method '' of scanning , sensing and decoding bar code symbols . Thereafter , the applicants filed a continuation of the divisional application , which eventually issued as the '186 patent . The '186 patent contains apparatus claims 1-10 and method claims 11-15 , with the method claims closely corresponding to the original Group VI claims . The broadest asserted apparatus and method claims , reprinted in the Appendix , both require a `` trigger '' and `` repetitively '' scan `` the directed laser beam across each symbol for reflection therefrom . '' Thus , the '186 patent claims a system that repetitively scans and senses a bar code symbol each time a user depresses the trigger . Each symbol is decoded from repetitive rather than single scans , thereby increasing the likelihood of achieving accurate decoding even for poorly printed symbols . In addition , claim 1 and claim 11 include limiting language for `` determining a successful decoding of each symbol , '' and for `` non-manually terminating the reading of each symbol upon the determination of the successful decoding thereof . '' See Appendix . Thus , the invented system alerts the user and automatically stops scanning when the symbol is decoded , permitting rapid and sequential decoding of multiple objects . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The same applicants claimed an advance over the invention of the '297 patent in an application filed on January 25 , 1982 , which later issued as the '470 patent . The '470 patent specification explains that , because the scanning laser beam of the invention *1574 claimed in the '297 patent passes through the inside of the device , `` a great deal of interior 'dead ' space within the head '' is required in order to accommodate the scanning beam . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In contrast , the '470 patent discloses a scanning head with a raised rear window that emits the laser beam over the outside top of the device rather than inside its housing . Claim 1 of the '470 patent , reprinted in the Appendix , includes : _NEWLINE_ ( g ) window means mounted on the housing , and having a light-transmissive window at the rear region in close adjacent confronting relationship with the scanning means thereat , said window being configured and positioned in the light path of said at least one swept beam to permit the latter to pass through the window and unobstructedly travel exteriorly of and past the front and intermediate body regions of the housing . _NEWLINE_ whereby the field of view of the swept beam is substantially independent of the predetermined width of the housing due to its exterior transmission outside of the front and intermediate body regions of the housing . _NEWLINE_ Thus , since the device no longer must accommodate the sweep width of the scanning beam , the invention allows a narrowing of the body of the device , with a corresponding reduction in overall size and weight . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . INFRINGEMENT _NEWLINE_ Opticon 's first contention on appeal is that Symbol presented insufficient evidence during its case-in-chief to establish a prima facie showing of infringement . Symbol , as the party asserting infringement , bore the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence . Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States , 717 F.2d 1351 , 1361 , 219 USPQ 473 , 480 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To prove infringement , Symbol offered the expert testimony of Mr. Edward Barkan ( Barkan ) , named as a co-inventor in each of the three patent applications . The court admitted into evidence charts and drawings used by Barkan to demonstrate infringement of the asserted claims , each of which contains `` means plus function '' limitations as permitted under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 ? 6 ( 1988 ) . The charts show each asserted claim broken down by limitation , with one or more numbers placed next to each limitation . Corresponding numbers identify various structural parts of the accused devices depicted in the drawings . Using the exhibits as a guide , Barkan stated that in his opinion each numbered claim limitation reproduced on the charts was met by the corresponding numbered structure of the device shown on the drawings . Furthermore , Barkan testified that his `` understanding of the patent claims [ was ] based upon the claims , as well as the specifications , as well as statements made during the prosecution history . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Determination of patent infringement is a two-step process : `` the meaning of the claims must be learned from a study of all relevant patent documents ; and the claims must be applied to the accused structures . '' Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Berco , S.P.A. , 714 F.2d 1110 , 1114 , 219 USPQ 185 , 187 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . Opticon contends that , under Pennwalt Corp. v. Durand-Wayland , Inc. , 833 F.2d 931 , 934 , 4 USPQ2d 1737 , 1739 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) , cert . denied , 485 U.S. 961 , 108 S.Ct . 1226 , 99 L.Ed.2d 426 ( 1988 ) , a party asserting infringement of claims with `` means plus function '' limitations must demonstrate to the fact-finder how each structure in the accused device , asserted to meet a functional claim limitation , is the same as or equivalent to a corresponding structure disclosed in the specification . Opticon cites the following passage from Pennwalt for support : _NEWLINE_ Where the issue is raised , it is part of the ultimate burden of proof of the patent owner to establish , with respect to a claim limitation in means-plus-function form , that the structure in the accused device which performs that function is the same as or an equivalent of the structure disclosed in the specification . _NEWLINE_ Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the circumstances of this case , however , Fed.R.Evid . 705 provides the answer to whether Symbol made a prima facie *1575 showing of infringement.2 At trial , Symbol suggested that the court receive the exhibits representing Barkan 's expert testimony without foundation , thus relieving the court and Barkan of the need to `` go through lengthy testimony explaining with each infringing device how he found that each element was infringed . '' Counsel for Opticon responded `` I really have no objection except ... that we have wanted to voir dire . '' After voir dire , Opticon failed to cross-examine Barkan on the issue that it now asserts fatally flaws the sufficiency of his testimony . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ By its express terms , ¡± 112 ? 6 permits an element in a claim to be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function . However , the scope of such a claim is not limitless , but is confined to structures expressly disclosed in the specification and corresponding equivalents . Thus , the statutory provision prevents an overly broad claim construction by requiring reference to the specification , and at the same time precludes an overly narrow construction that would restrict coverage solely to those means expressly disclosed in the specification . Johnston v. IVAC Corp. , 885 F.2d 1574 , 1580 , 12 USPQ2d 1382 , 1386-87 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) ( statutory provision acts as restriction on claim scope ) ; Data Line Corp. v. Micro Technologies , Inc. , 813 F.2d 1196 , 1201 , 1 USPQ2d 2052 , 2055 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ( statutory provision precludes a construction limited to structures expressly disclosed in specification ) ; D.M.I. , Inc. v. Deere & Co. , 755 F.2d 1570 , 1574 , 225 USPQ 236 , 238 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( statutory provision requires that `` limitation shall be construed to cover structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof '' ( emphasis in original ) ) . In short , applying a claim drafted under ¡± 112 ? 6 to an accused structure is not a simple task . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Opticon argues that Barkan must have misunderstood this task , because he testified on the ultimate issue of infringement without discussing in detail equivalency between the structures of the accused devices and the structures disclosed in the patent specifications . However , testimony on the ultimate issue of infringement is permissible in patent cases . Snellman v. Ricoh Co. , 862 F.2d 283 , 287 , 8 USPQ2d 1996 , 2000 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) , cert . denied , 491 U.S. 910 , 109 S.Ct . 3199 , 105 L.Ed.2d 707 ( 1989 ) ( `` [ a ] lthough claim interpretation is a question of law , expert testimony is admissible ... to give an opinion on the ultimate question of infringement '' ( citations omitted ) ) ; Fed.R.Evid . 704 . The scope of literally infringing `` equivalents '' under ¡± 112 ? 6 is a factual determination . King Instrument Corp. v. Otari Corp. , 767 F.2d 853 , 862 , 226 USPQ 402 , 408 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) , cert . denied , 475 U.S. 1016 , 106 S.Ct . 1197 , 89 L.Ed.2d 312 ( 1986 ) . The responsibility for challenging the factual underpinnings of the testimony fell squarely on Opticon during cross-examination . See Smith v. Ford Motor Co. , 626 F.2d 784 , 793 ( 10th Cir.1980 ) , cert . denied , 450 U.S. 918 , 101 S.Ct . 1363 , 67 L.Ed.2d 344 ( 1981 ) ( `` 'the full burden of exploration of the facts and assumptions underlying the testimony of an expert witness [ is ] squarely on the shoulders of opposing counsel 's cross-examination ' `` ( citation omitted ) ) ; see also Bryan v. FMC Corp. , John Bean Div. , 566 F.2d 541 , 545 ( 5th Cir.1978 ) ( `` rule 705 shifts to the cross-examiner the burden of eliciting the bases of an expert witness ' opinion '' ) ; United States v. Santarpio , 560 F.2d 448 , 454-55 ( 1st Cir.1977 ) , cert . denied sub nom. , Schepici v. United States , 434 U.S. 984 , 98 S.Ct . 609 , 54 L.Ed.2d 478 ( 1977 ) ( under Rule 705 , court was entitled to credit expert 's conclusion even though expert did not describe and explain the relevance of factors upon which his opinion rested ; defendant neither cross-examined on basis for opinion nor attempted to show its inadequacy ) ; C. Van Der Lely , N.V. v. F. Ili Maschio S.n.c. , 221 USPQ 34 , 41 , 1984 WL 179 ( S.D.Ohio 1983 ) , aff 'd , *1576 748 F.2d 1568 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( under Rule 705 , `` [ c ] ross-examination [ is ] the proper procedure for the defendant to challenge the accuracy of [ the expert 's ] opinion '' ) . Opticon failed to seize the opportunity , provided by the Rule , to demonstrate that Barkan 's opinion testimony was factually incorrect . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Rule 705 functions to abbreviate trials by permitting opinion testimony without factual foundation . We see no reason why Rule 705 is not fully applicable to patent trials and opinion testimony on infringement of claims under ¡± 112 ? 6 . We have not directly addressed this issue , but have previously applied Rule 705 in a patent case on the issue of damages , stating that an expert need not `` reveal the facts or data underlying his opinion ... because [ the defendant ] did not cross-examine on this issue and the master did not require otherwise . '' Studiengesellschaft Kohle v. Dart Indus. , 862 F.2d 1564 , 1567 , 9 USPQ2d 1273 , 1277 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . Moreover , the Federal Rules of Evidence are expressly applicable to all proceedings in the courts of the United States , which must include civil suits arising under Title 35 . Fed.R.Evid . 101 . Finally , the specific purpose behind Rule 705 is to avoid `` complex and time consuming '' testimony by permitting an expert to `` 'state his opinion and reasons without first specifying the data upon which it is based . ' `` Fed.R.Evid . 705 advisory committee 's note quoting Rule 4515 , N.Y. CPLR ( McKinney 1963 ) . Patent cases , so often typified by lengthy testimony on complex technical issues , are particularly served by this purpose . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In short , Symbol was permitted to rest its prima facie case on Barkan 's expert testimony , including charts , that the patents were infringed , and the District Court was free to accept or reject that evidence . Of course , by resting its case on summary testimony , Symbol was left exposed to a profound risk that Opticon , during its defense or cross-examination of Barkan , would demonstrate that the accused devices were non-infringing under a different and proper construction of the claims . Opticon willingly permitted Symbol to bear this risk , but chose not to expose Barkan 's testimony to the glaring light of cross-examination on this issue . Having lost below , Opticon can not here recoup for its failed litigation strategy.3 In view of the legal effect of the expedited procedure , we must reject Opticon 's contention that Symbol failed to present a prima facie case of infringement . Since Opticon offers no argument that its products do not infringe on the facts , we need not review infringement itself . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . VALIDITY _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A. Obviousness _NEWLINE_ Opticon challenges the District Court 's conclusion that the inventions of the '297 and '186 patents were not proved invalid for obviousness under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( 1988 ) .4 We must answer whether `` the prior art made obvious the invention as a whole for which patentability is claimed . '' Hartness Int ' l Inc. v. Simplimatic Eng ' g Co. , 819 F.2d 1100 , 1108 , 2 USPQ2d 1826 , 1832 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) . We do not `` pick and choose among the individual elements of assorted prior art references to recreate the claimed invention , '' but rather , we look for `` some teaching or suggestion in the references to support their use in the particular claimed combination . '' Smithkline Diagnostics , Inc. v. Helena Laboratories Corp. , 859 F.2d 878 , 887 , 8 USPQ2d 1468 , 1475 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1577 The District Court found that the prior art consisted of U.S. Patent No . 4,251,798 ( the '798 patent ) , which describes the Laserchek , and references which describe the Laserscan , the Verifier 315 , the Monitor 101 , and the Carton Counter . We review here the teachings of that art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '798 patent is prior art under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( e ) ( 1988 ) . The '798 patent claims a portable laser scanning head that detects and decodes laser beams reflected from bar codes . The reference discloses a device that can read in a non-contact position : _NEWLINE_ This 'depth of field ' feature permits a user to scan bar code symbols imprinted both on a flat surface and on a curved surface merely by moving the head towards a position anywhere within 2¡² of the symbol . _NEWLINE_ '798 patent , col. 5 , line 66-col. 6 , line 6 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ During prosecution of the '297 patent , the '798 patent was the basis for discussions about the permissible scope of the '297 patent claims . Indeed , the examiner originally rejected the claimed invention as obvious in light of the disclosure in the '798 patent . Following an interview with the examiner , the applicants amended the claims to include the handle , trigger and sighting means that appear in claim 1 and are quoted above . The examiner allowed the claims in view of the amendment . The District Court agreed with the examiner 's conclusion that the addition of the handle , trigger and sighting means ( described by the District Court as the `` aim and shoot '' feature ) to the self-scanning means distinguished the invention claimed in the '297 patent from the disclosure in the '798 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Laserchek device , a Symbol product , is described in the '798 patent . Following a demonstration of the device at trial , the District Court found that the Laserchek was a bar code verification device , had no trigger , normally blocked the user 's view of the bar code during use , and could not be used in the `` aim and shoot '' fashion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Laserscan was merely a modified version of the Laserchek . The Laserscan consisted of the Laserchek scanning head attached to a console in turn attached to a computer . The District Court found that the Laserscan was not capable of functioning in `` aim and shoot '' mode because the device had no trigger and obscured the bar code during use . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Verifier 315 was a bar code reader designed to be used with its feet resting on a surface and its front reading `` snout '' positioned above the bar code by a small , fixed distance . The District Court found that the device blocked the user 's view of the bar code during use and had no trigger . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Monitor 101 was developed in the mid-1970 's to verify the accuracy of bar codes as they are printed . During printing , the bar codes pass underneath the device , which is fixed above the printing press . The District Court found that the Monitor 101 was neither hand held nor capable of operating in `` aim and shoot '' fashion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Carton Counter counted cartons and was not a bar code reader . However , the device had a trigger , not to initiate decoding of a bar code , but to reset the counter to zero . A brochure describing the Carton Counter was before the examiner and found not to be pertinent . The District Court , finding that the carton counter `` is not self-scanning ; rather , it must be dragged over the carton edges , '' concluded that the device `` lacks any disclosure , recognition , or teaching of an aim and shoot device . '' 17 USPQ2d at 1746 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The District Court thus concluded that the invention would not have been obvious in light of the prior art because the considered references did not disclose or suggest the `` aim and shoot '' feature claimed in parts ( c ) , ( d ) , ( h ) and ( i ) of claim 1 of the '297 patent . We agree . Here the very difference between the claims and the considered art is the `` aim and shoot '' feature found critical to the patentability of the invention . Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 693-94 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 , 148 USPQ 459 , 467 ( 1966 ) ( ¡± 103 requires consideration , inter alia , of differences between prior art and claimed invention as a whole ) . Thus , a person of ordinary skill in the art , having all of the *1578 teachings of the considered references before him , would have found no `` teaching or suggestion in the references '' of the invention claimed in the '297 patent . Smithkline Diagnostics , 859 F.2d at 887 , 8 USPQ2d at 1475 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ However , in reaching its conclusion , the District Court excluded sketches and tentative specifications relating to a device known as the X-Scanner , on the theory that `` 'prior art ' in an obviousness determination [ ] must ... be enabling , that is , disclose the disseminated subject matter to the public , in a manner such that one skilled in the art could make and operate such a device . '' 17 USPQ2d at 1740 . While a reference must enable someone to practice the invention in order to anticipate under ¡± 102 ( b ) , a non-enabling reference may qualify as prior art for the purpose of determining obviousness under ¡± 103 . Reading & Bates Constr . Co. v. Baker Energy Resources Corp. , 748 F.2d 645 , 652 , 223 USPQ 1168 , 1173 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( reference that lacks enabling disclosure is not anticipating , but `` itself may qualify as a prior art reference under ¡± 103 , but only for what is disclosed in it '' ( emphasis in original ) ) ; see Beckman Instruments , Inc. v. LKB Produkter AB , 892 F.2d 1547 , 1551 , 13 USPQ2d 1301 , 1304 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) ( `` [ e ] ven if a reference discloses an inoperative device , it is prior art for all that it teaches '' ) . Undisputed evidence demonstrated that the sketches and tentative specifications , together known as the X-Scanner reference , were publicly available more than one year before the effective filing date . The District Court 's finding to the contrary is clearly erroneous . While the District Court clearly erred in excluding the X-Scanner sketches and tentative specifications from the prior art for the purpose of evaluating obviousness under ¡± 103 , that error did not preclude the District Court from alternatively reaching its factual conclusions regarding those materials . The District Court specifically stated , in pertinent part , that `` the ' X-Scanner ' had to be dragged across the symbol rather than being aimed and shot . '' 17 USPQ2d at 1747 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The X-Scanner reference discloses a 2 lb . laser scanning head for reading bar code symbols at a maximum working range of 4¡² from the bar code . Thus , like the '798 patent , the reference discloses a device capable of reading in a non-contact position . The disclosed device has a trigger , and may be used in either `` portable mode '' or `` permanent mount mode . '' When operated in permanent mount mode , the device scans continuously from a fixed position above the bar code , much like the Verifier 315 already considered . The reference explains that the device , when operated in portable mode , has a `` 0-2 seconds scan duration '' which is activated by a `` trigger . '' In both modes , the laser beam puts out an `` X '' pattern and the `` [ s ] ymbol must move across [ the scanning ] field , or vice versa . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In support of its conclusion that the X-Scanner had to be dragged across the symbol rather than aimed and shot , the District Court cited the expert testimony of Symbol 's expert witness , Mr. Swartz . Swartz testified that the X-Scanner 's `` mode of use '' was sufficiently different from the invention of the '297 patent that it was `` not a device that is used in a shoot mode , [ ] because it is , it creates an X-pattern as shown . '' Therefore , to obtain a reading , `` [ y ] ou can not do it stationary , you must have relative motion [ between the symbol and device ] . '' Swartz also stated `` [ y ] ou would have to move [ the scan head ] , you could not use it in aim and shoot mode . '' Opticon 's evidence to the contrary failed to persuade the District Court , and Opticon has failed to persuade us that the District Court committed reversible error in crediting Symbol 's evidence on this point . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The obviousness inquiry conducted by the District Court correctly included review of the evidence offered on the objective indicia of nonobviousness , Stratoflex , Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp. , 713 F.2d 1530 , 1538 , 218 USPQ 871 , 879 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) , which included the failure of others to develop the claimed invention and its commercial success . Nonobviousness is suggested by the failure of others to `` find a solution to the problem which the patent [ s ] in question purport [ ] to solve . Such evidence *1579 shows indirectly the presence of a significant defect [ in the prior art ] , while serving as a simulated laboratory test of the obviousness of the solution to a skilled artisan . '' Note , Subtests of `` Nonobviousness '' : A Nontechnical Approach to Patent Validity , 112 U.Pa.L.Rev . 1169 , 1173 ( 1964 ) . On this issue , the District Court found that Opticon 's own expert witness , Mr. Collins , was `` closely involved with the bar code industry since its inception and [ ] never conceived or developed an aim and shoot scanning device . '' 17 USPQ2d at 1747 . The court further found that , despite years of effort , Opticon 's technical witness , Mr. Knowles , was `` never able to develop a scanner with the aim and shoot feature of the patents in suit . '' Id . Furthermore , as found by the District Court , Symbol 's `` aim and shoot '' scanners have enjoyed tremendous commercial success , with about 200,000 devices sold for over $ 150,000,000 as of the time of trial . These findings are not challenged by Opticon . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In short , under the evidence that was put forward by Symbol and properly accepted by the court , the omitted reference adds nothing to the scope of the already considered prior art except a trigger in a bar code reader . This addition is minor , because the Carton Counter already discloses a trigger , although in a device for counting cartons . When the X-Scanner reference is considered with all the other references , the prior art as a whole still lacks a disclosure or suggestion of the `` aim and shoot '' feature , in which a laser beam sweeps laterally across the bar code while the hand-held device is held stationary and the target can be viewed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We thus conclude that , even when the X-Scanner reference is included in the prior art , Opticon has not met its burden of proving that the inventions of the '297 and '186 patents would have been obvious under ¡± 103 . The District Court 's error in alternatively excluding the X-Scanner reference from the prior art was therefore harmless . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Double Patenting _NEWLINE_ Opticon challenges the District Court 's conclusion that the '186 patent was not invalid for obviousness-type double patenting over the '297 patent . After the examiner required restriction during prosecution of the '297 patent , the applicants filed a divisional application containing method claims drawn to the invention of the originally non-elected Group VI claims . A continuation of the divisional containing both the old method and new apparatus claims eventually issued as the '186 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With regard to double patenting , we recently explained that 35 U.S.C . ¡± 121 ( 1988 ) 5 will not apply to remove the parent as a reference where the principle of consonance is violated : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Consonance requires that the line of demarcation between the `` independent and distinct inventions '' that prompted the restriction requirement be maintained . Though the claims may be amended , they must not be so amended as to bring them back over the line imposed in the restriction requirement . Where that line is crossed the prohibition of the third sentence of Section 121 does not apply . _NEWLINE_ Gerber Garment Technology , Inc. v. Lectra Systems , Inc. , 916 F.2d 683 , 688 , 16 USPQ2d 1436 , 1440 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) . _NEWLINE_ The corollary to this Court 's statement in Gerber Garment is that new or amended claims in a divisional application are entitled to the benefit of ¡± 121 if the claims do not cross the line of demarcation drawn around the invention elected in the restriction requirement . If that line is crossed , the issue is whether the invention claimed in the '186 patent would have been obvious in light of the invention claimed in the '297 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1580 Opticon contends , as it did before the trial court , that the appearance of `` a whole new group of apparatus claims along with the method claims '' in the '186 patent proves that the claims `` asserted against Opticon are drawn to the elected species of the '297 patent and not the species upon which the divisional was filed . '' We read Opticon 's bare assertions in its opening brief , without record citation , to allege that because the Group VI invention was described as a `` method '' in the restriction requirement , the added apparatus claims fail to comply with the requirement . The District Court had before it the declaration of Mr. Berger , which fully supports a conclusion that both the method and apparatus claims are directed to the Group VI invention . Berger stated that the Group VI invention is a system of scanner plus decoder , with a means for stopping the scanner after the symbol is successfully decoded . Therefore , whether method or apparatus , all the '186 patent claims are drawn to that system . Berger further asserted that in the electronic arts , the Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) has not restricted between claims to an apparatus and to a method of using the apparatus . Cf . Studiengesellschaft Kohle v. Northern Petrochemical Co. , 784 F.2d 351 , 354 , 228 USPQ 837 , 840 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) , cert . dismissed , 478 U.S. 1028 , 106 S.Ct . 3343 , 92 L.Ed.2d 763 ( 1986 ) ( chemical composition claims defined invention different from process claims ) . In short , Berger explained that the word `` method '' in the description of Group VI during restriction did not mean that the claims were limited to a method , but was merely a short-hand description of the invented system . For support , Berger stated that the examiner collectively characterized the method and apparatus claims of another non-elected group , Group IV , as a `` method . '' Finally , Berger noted that the examiner 's statement that `` the Group I invention does not require the particular apparatus of Group ... VI , '' ( emphasis added ) can not be reconciled with Opticon 's argument that the invention of Group VI could only be expressed as a method . In light of this testimony , we can not agree that a breach of the restriction requirement occurred . The safeguard of ¡± 121 therefore applies in this case , and the '297 patent is not available as a reference against the '186 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , even if there had been a breach of the restriction requirement , we would reject Opticon 's argument on the ultimate obviousness-type double patenting inquiry : whether the claims of the '186 patent are patentably distinct from the claims of the '297 patent . See In re Borah , 354 F.2d 1009 , 1017 , 148 USPQ 213 , 220 ( CCPA 1966 ) ( crux of obviousness-type double patenting inquiry lies in comparison of claims ) ; see also Gerber Garment , 916 F.2d at 686 , 16 USPQ2d at 1438 ( judicially created doctrine of obviousness-type double patenting applies when two applications or patents , not drawn to precisely the same invention , are `` drawn to inventions so very much alike as to render one obvious in view of the other and to effectively extend the life of the patent that would have the earlier of the two issue dates '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Double patenting is an affirmative defense . Studiengesellschaft Kohle v. Northern Petrochemical Co. , 784 F.2d at 352 , 228 USPQ at 838 . Opticon was therefore required to prove double patenting by clear and convincing evidence , a heavy and unshifting burden . RCA Corp. v. Applied Digital Data Sys. , Inc. , 730 F.2d 1440 , 1444 , 221 USPQ 385 , 387 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( invalidity requires clear and convincing proof , and burden remains at all times with patent challenger ) ; Carman Indus. , Inc. v. Wahl , 724 F.2d 932 , 940 , 220 USPQ 481 , 487 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ( `` [ t ] here is a heavy burden of proof on one seeking to show double patenting '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Opticon 's conclusory allegation that the District Court 's decision on double patenting was in error , without citation to the record , the patents or the testimony of the witnesses , does not support reversal . See In re Mulder , 716 F.2d 1542 , 1550 , 219 USPQ 189 , 197 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) ( to obtain reversal , appellant must clearly explain why decision below is wrong ) . As a court of review , it is not our function to search the voluminous trial record , prosecution histories , and patents to fashion a substantive *1581 basis for Opticon 's argument . See Preemption Devices , Inc. v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg . Co. , 732 F.2d 903 , 905 , 221 USPQ 841 , 842 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( as appellate court , it is not our function to search the record in order to reach a conclusion favoring appellant ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Nevertheless , even a brief review of the '297 patent reveals that all of the asserted claims are directed to a laser self-scanning head with a `` trigger , '' a `` handle , '' and means for `` sighting the symbol along a direct line of sight . '' In contrast , the asserted claims of the '186 patent recite additional features . Although the claims of the '186 patent cover a laser scanning system that includes a portable laser scanning head , the system also includes means for repetitively self scanning a bar code symbol until it is decoded . Furthermore , when successful decoding has been achieved , the system alerts the user and automatically stops scanning . The repetitive scan feature adds the advantage of increasing the accuracy of decoding . Claim 8 includes a further feature of terminating the repetitive scan if no successful decode is achieved within a set time period . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Opticon contends in its reply brief that the automatic termination feature is merely an obvious addition to the invention claimed in the '297 patent , because its expert testified that this feature `` is a software program , essentially a software program , or firmware program , if you go back far enough in time . '' The mere reference to `` a software program '' does not demonstrate that the program would have been obvious or that its addition to the invention of the '297 patent would have been obvious . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , the policy behind the double patenting doctrine , the prevention of unlawful extension of the patent grant , does not favor Opticon 's position . Although the '297 patent will expire before the '186 patent , the '186 patent will not `` extend '' the property right conveyed in the '297 patent . See Gerber Garment , 916 F.2d at 686 , 16 USPQ2d at 1438 ( obviousness-type double patenting occurs when a second patent would `` effectively extend the life of the patent that would have the earlier of the two issue dates '' ) . Since the '186 patent is not infringed by practice of the invention claimed in the '297 patent , the world will be free to use the invention of the '297 patent once it expires . See In re Kaplan , 789 F.2d 1574 , 1578 , 229 USPQ 678 , 681-82 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) ( no double patenting found where no extension of patent right is possible because when the first to issue patent expires , `` the world will be free to use '' the first patented invention so long as the second patented invention is not used in it ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , Opticon contends that the judgment of the District Court should be reversed for failure to state findings of fact under Fed.R.Civ.P . 52 ( a ) . On appeal , Opticon raises the issue of consonance . As this Court explained in Gerber Garment , `` [ t ] he presence or absence of consonance will necessarily depend upon analysis of the involved claims , '' 916 F.2d at 688 , 16 USPQ2d at 1441 , which are construed as a matter of law . Cf . Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil , 774 F.2d 1132 , 1138 n. 3 , 227 USPQ 543 , 547 n. 3 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( `` Under this court 's precedent substantial identity between claims , a matter of claim interpretation , is a question of law. '' ) . In connection with construing claims , we are free to examine the prosecution history on appeal even where the trial court erroneously fails to consider it . See Lemelson v. United States , 752 F.2d 1538 , 1550 , 224 USPQ 526 , 532-33 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . This is particularly so where , as here , there are no underlying findings of fact required for such construction . Because we have concluded that the claims of the '186 patent are within the subject matter of Group VI as a matter of law , the absence of Rule 52 ( a ) findings of fact on this issue is not reversible error . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We thus conclude that Opticon has failed to demonstrate that the District Court erred in finding that no claim in the '186 patent was proved invalid for double patenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . ENFORCEABILITY _NEWLINE_ Opticon challenges the District Court 's conclusion that neither the *1582 '297 patent nor the '186 patent are unenforceable because of inequitable conduct during prosecution . Opticon reiterates its argument , considered and rejected below , that Symbol fraudulently withheld information from the examiner concerning the Verifier 315 and the Laserscan during prosecution of the '297 and '186 patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Opticon asserts that the District Court erroneously failed to consider references that Symbol `` should have known '' were material , citing FMC Corp. v. Manitowoc Co. , 835 F.2d 1411 , 1415 , 5 USPQ2d 1112 , 1116 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) . However , we have repeatedly rejected the simple negligence standard that Opticon urges us to adopt . See , e.g. , Jaskiewicz v. Mossinghoff , 822 F.2d 1053 , 1058 , 3 USPQ2d 1294 , 1299 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ( `` [ m ] ere negligence is not sufficient to infer fraud or dishonesty '' ) . Moreover , even a finding of gross negligence : _NEWLINE_ does not of itself justify an inference of intent to deceive ; the involved conduct , viewed in light of all the evidence , including evidence indicative of good faith , must indicate sufficient culpability to require a finding of intent to deceive . _NEWLINE_ Kingsdown Medical Consultants v. Hollister Inc. , 863 F.2d 867 , 876 , 9 USPQ2d 1384 , 1392 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) , cert . denied , 490 U.S. 1067 , 109 S.Ct . 2068 , 104 L.Ed.2d 633 ( 1989 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Opticon asserts that a flyer submitted by Symbol during reexamination depicted an operational Verifier 315 , and that Symbol deceived the PTO by indicating that the flyer depicted only an empty shell or housing . The record is replete with evidence supporting a conclusion that , at the very least , Symbol possessed a good faith belief that the photograph in the flyer indeed depicted only an empty shell of an inoperable device , a belief to which the District Court , in the final analysis , itself concurred . Opticon further argues that Symbol improperly withheld from the examiner information relating to the Laserscan device during prosecution of its patents , but as noted supra , that device was a modified version of the Laserchek device disclosed in the '798 patent . We conclude that the reference was merely cumulative to the teachings of the '798 patent , imparting no obligation to disclose . See J.P. Stevens & Co. v. Lex Tex , Ltd. , 747 F.2d 1553 , 223 USPQ 1089 , 1092 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) , cert . denied , 474 U.S. 822 , 106 S.Ct . 73 , 88 L.Ed.2d 60 ( 1985 ) ( `` [ a ] reference that would have been merely cumulative is not material '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We find no abuse of discretion in the District Court 's conclusion that the '297 and '186 patents were not proved unenforceable for inequitable conduct during prosecution . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ V. CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ Among other issues , Opticon alleges that the sparseness of the District Court 's Rule 52 findings , particularly on infringement and double patenting , preclude effective appellate review . Our opinion amply demonstrates the absence of merit in that allegation . Having duly considered and rejected each of Opticon 's other arguments , we affirm the judgment of the District Court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ APPENDIX _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '297 Patent _NEWLINE_ 1 .

We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Background _NEWLINE_ Tec Air , Inc. ( `` Tec Air '' ) owns U.S. Patent Nos . 4,047,692 and 4,107,257 ( `` the Swin patents '' ) , both of which have effective filing dates of September 24 , 1975 . The Swin patents describe a method of and a device for making properly balanced , injected-molded fans . One way to balance a plastic fan is to use balance `` pads , '' `` lugs , '' or `` plugs , '' which are deposits of plastic located in appropriate places on the fan . To create these lugs , a hollow column is formed in a steel fan mold , which fills with molten plastic during the injection-molding process . When Tec Air entered the fan molding business in 1972 , like other manufacturers , it used several methods of creating these columns , such as grinding or drilling holes in mold inserts and refilling them if needed . A mold insert forms a portion of the overall fan . Tec Air also inserted replaceable brass rods into hollowed-out sections of the mold insert , which are drilled more easily because brass is a softer metal than steel ( the `` brass plug method '' ) . In June 1974 , Tec Air 's employee , Richard Swin , Sr. , conceived the method disclosed in the Swin patents-inserting adjustable screws into hollowed-out sections of the mold insert that is used to form the fan hub . These screws are accessible from the front or cavity-side of the mold . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Throughout the development of the claimed invention , Tec Air continued to market its fans and fan molds . For example , in June 1974 , Tec Air offered to sell Keeprite Products ( `` Keeprite '' ) injected- *1357 molded fans and the corresponding mold . Keeprite placed an order in July 1974 and Tec Air created drawings for the Keeprite fan . One drawing , dated August 16 , 1974 , shows `` balance plugs '' on the fan , but does not specify the method of creating them . Before September 24 , 1974 , Tec Air asked its mold maker , Jack Dearhammer at Mid City Tool & Die , to quote it a price for making a mold insert for the Keeprite fan . The sketch used for this price quotation did not show balance plugs , but Dearhammer ultimately made the mold insert capable of producing balance plugs by inserting adjustable screws into hollowed-out sections of the mold . In another attempt to solicit business , Tec Air sent sample fans to Howard Industries on August 14 , 1974 . These fans were model number 4B-60-21 . On August 13 , 1974 , Dearhammer returned to Tec Air the mold insert used to make the 4B-60-21 fan , after he had modified it to include the patented invention 's adjustable screws . Prior to sending the mold to Dearhammer , however , Tec Air accumulated thousands of the 4B-60-21 fans in its inventory , which were made by prior art balancing techniques . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 1991 , Tec Air sued Denso for infringement because it manufactured radiator and condenser assemblies that included a fan that was balanced according to the claimed method . Tec Air won the infringement phase of the trifurcated trial , which Denso does not appeal . A jury then heard the invalidity phase of the suit , in which Denso argued that the patents are invalid because Tec Air offered the invention for sale more than one year before the effective filing date and because the invention of the claims would have been obvious . The jury returned special interrogatories indicating that Tec Air neither sold nor offered the invention for sale before the critical date and that the patented invention would not have been obvious . The same jury subsequently awarded damages of $ 25.2 million , which corresponds to a royalty of 6.5 % of the infringing sales of Denso 's entire radiator and condenser assemblies , but is nevertheless less than the royalty requested by Tec Air . Denso moved for judgment as a matter of law , or alternatively , for a new trial on the validity and damages issues . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law because , although the evidence showed that Tec Air possessed mold inserts having adjustable screws before the critical date , there was evidence that Tec Air did not use these inserts to create commercial products . In addition , the court determined not only that Denso failed to establish a prima facie case of obviousness for lack of a suggestion to combine the cited references , but also that Tec Air produced sufficient objective evidence of nonobviousness . The court also held that the jury properly used the entire market value rule in measuring damages because each Denso assembly was a single functioning unit , which included the infringing fan . The court then denied Denso 's motion for a new trial because the evidence was sufficient to support the invalidity verdict and the damage award was neither excessive nor the product of improper considerations . This appeal followed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Discussion _NEWLINE_ `` We review a trial court 's decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict by reapplying its own standard of review . Therefore , for [ Denso ] to prevail on appeal it must prove that the jury 's factual findings were not supported by substantial evidence or that the facts were not sufficient to support the conclusions necessarily drawn by the jury on the way to its verdict . '' Applied Med . Resources Corp. v. United States Surgical Corp. , 147 F.3d 1374 , 1376 , 47 USPQ2d 1289 , 1290 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( citations omitted ) . In evaluating whether Denso met this standard , `` we must consider the evidence of record in the light most favorable to [ Tec Air ] , drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor , without disturbing the jury 's credibility *1358 determinations or substituting our resolutions of conflicting evidence for those of the jury . '' Id . at 1376-77 , 47 USPQ2d at 1291 . If no reasonable person could have reached a verdict for Tec Air in light of the record before the jury , Denso will prevail . See id . at 1376 , 47 USPQ2d at 1291 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On-Sale Bar _NEWLINE_ `` The ultimate determination that a product was placed on sale under [ 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( b ) ( 1994 ) ] is a question of law , based on underlying facts . '' Ferag AG v. Quipp Inc. , 45 F.3d 1562 , 1566 , 33 USPQ2d 1512 , 1514-15 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) . To prove that the Swin patents are invalid for violating the on-sale bar , Denso `` must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that there was a definite sale or offer to sell more than one year before the application for the subject patent , and that the subject matter of the sale or offer to sell fully anticipated the claimed invention or would have rendered the claimed invention obvious by its addition to the prior art . '' Id . ( internal quotations omitted ) ; see also Pfaff v. Wells Elecs. , Inc. , 525 U.S. 55 , 119 S.Ct . 304 , 311 , 142 L.Ed.2d 261 ( 1998 ) ( `` First , the product must be the subject of a commercial offer for sale . `` ) ; Scaltech Inc. v. Retec/Tetra , L.L.C. , 178 F.3d 1378 , 1383 , 51 USPQ2d 1055 , 1058 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( `` [ T ] he first determination in the ¡± 102 ( b ) analysis must be whether the subject of the barring activity met each of the limitations of the claim , and thus was an embodiment of the claimed invention. '' ) . If this subject matter anticipates the claimed invention or would have rendered it obvious , the invention itself must also have been `` ready for patenting '' at the time of the offer or sale-e.g. , the invention must have been reduced to practice or embodied in `` drawings or other descriptions ... that [ are ] sufficiently specific to enable a person skilled in the art to practice the invention . '' Pfaff , 119 S.Ct . at 312 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Denso claims that Tec Air offered the invention for sale on June 26 , 1974 to Keeprite and on August 14 , 1974 to Howard Industries , both prior to the critical date of September 24 , 1974 . According to Tec Air , although it ultimately shipped fans made according to the invention to these customers , it did not specify the balancing technique in its offers and it did not intend to use the patented one when it made the offers . Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Tec Air , we hold that the jury reasonably could have found that Tec Air 's offers to Keeprite and Howard Industries did not raise the on-sale bar because the subject matter of these offers does not fully anticipate the claimed invention and Denso does not argue that it would have rendered the invention obvious . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Denso argues that no reasonable jury could have found that the reference to `` balance plugs '' on the August 16 , 1974 drawing for the Keeprite fan meant anything other than balance plugs made according to the Swin patents because the mold was ultimately made with adjustable screws . The drawing itself sheds no light on the method of making the fan . To buttress its claim , therefore , Denso cites Dearhammer 's testimony that he thought the notation referred to adjustable screws and that Tec Air employees called the adjustable screws `` balance plugs . '' Tec Air 's employee Richard Swin , Jr. testified , however , that the plastic lugs formed on the fan blade are called `` balance plugs , '' regardless of the method used to create them . He also testified that Tec Air intended to use the brass plug method to balance the Keeprite fan when it made the August 1974 drawing and did not tell Dearhammer that adjustable screws would be used until October 29 , 1974 , when it sent him specifications for the first time . Dearhammer admitted that the sketch he used to quote a price for the Keeprite mold did not show adjustable screws . In light of this evidence , the jury reasonably could have found that Tec Air did not offer *1359 the patented invention for sale to Keeprite before the critical date . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Denso stresses that the August 1974 drawing shows that the invention was ready for patenting , thus satisfying the second prong of Pfaff . See 119 S.Ct . at 312 . However , because the offer for sale did not involve subject matter that either anticipates the invention or would have rendered it obvious , Pfaff 's second prong is irrelevant . Pfaff did not remove the requirement that the subject matter of the commercial offer for sale `` be something within the scope of the claim . '' Scaltech , 178 F.3d at 1383 , 51 USPQ2d at 1058 . Accordingly , Denso 's reliance on Pfaff does not have the talismanic effect it desires . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Denso also argues that no reasonable jury could have found that the samples sent to Howard Industries with the August 14 , 1974 offer letter were not made pursuant to the Swin patents because Tec Air received the modified mold the day before . It also claims that the sent fans must have had balance lugs made according to the patents because Howard Industries sent a letter in January 1975 asking Tec Air to move the `` balancing lugs '' on the 4B-60-21 fan . Tec Air argues that the jury reasonably could have found that the samples were made before August 13 , 1974 because it had thousands of 4B-60-21 fans in inventory before it sent the mold to Mid City . Swin , Jr. testified that he selected the 4B-60-21 fan mold insert to be modified in part because Tec Air had a sufficient inventory of 4B-60-21 fans that it could ship while he tested the modified mold . Because balance lugs can be formed by several methods , the January 1975 letter does not indisputably show that Tec Air made the sent fans with the modified mold . Swin , Jr. testified , furthermore , that he did not make any fans from the modified mold until September 1974 . Denso 's argument relies on an inference that Tec Air immediately ran samples from the modified mold , despite Swin , Jr. 's testimony to the contrary . Although Swin , Jr. was an interested witness , the jury could have reasonably believed him in light of the large number of 4B-60-21 fans available in Tec Air 's inventory . Therefore , the court did not err in denying Denso 's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of validity under section 102 ( b ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Obviousness _NEWLINE_ `` Obviousness under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 [ ( 1994 ) ] is a legal conclusion based on factual evidence , '' which we review `` for correctness or error as a matter of law . '' In re Fine , 837 F.2d 1071 , 1073 , 5 USPQ2d 1596 , 1598 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( internal quotations omitted ) . These factual underpinnings include what a prior art reference teaches , whether a reference provides a motivation to combine its teachings with others , see In re Beattie , 974 F.2d 1309 , 1311 , 24 USPQ2d 1040 , 1041-42 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) , whether the invention experienced commercial success , and whether it satisfied a long-felt , but unmet need , see C.R . Bard , Inc. v. M3 Sys. , Inc. , 157 F.3d 1340 , 1351 , 48 USPQ2d 1225 , 1231 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In reviewing `` a jury special verdict on patent claim obviousness where the underlying facts have been disputed [ , ] ... [ w ] e first presume that the jury resolved the underlying factual disputes in favor of the verdict winner and leave those presumed findings undisturbed if they are supported by substantial evidence . Then we examine the legal conclusion de novo to see whether it is correct in light of the presumed jury fact findings . '' Jurgens v. McKasy , 927 F.2d 1552 , 1557 , 18 USPQ2d 1031 , 1035 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( citations omitted ) . The same rule also applies to special interrogatories . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To establish a prima facie case of obviousness , Denso must show `` some objective teaching in the prior art or that knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art would lead that individual to combine the relevant teachings of the references . '' *1360 Fine , 837 F.2d at 1074 , 5 USPQ2d at 1598 . There is no suggestion to combine , however , if a reference teaches away from its combination with another source . See id . at 1075 , 5 USPQ2d at 1599 . `` A reference may be said to teach away when a person of ordinary skill , upon reading the reference , would be discouraged from following the path set out in the reference , or would be led in a direction divergent from the path that was taken by the applicant ... [ or ] if it suggests that the line of development flowing from the reference 's disclosure is unlikely to be productive of the result sought by the applicant . '' In re Gurley , 27 F.3d 551 , 553 , 31 USPQ2d 1130 , 1131 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . If when combined , the references `` would produce a seemingly inoperative device , '' then they teach away from their combination . In re Sponnoble , 56 C.C.P.A . 823 , 405 F.2d 578 , 587 , 160 USPQ 237 , 244 ( 1969 ) ; see also In re Gordon , 733 F.2d 900 , 902 , 221 USPQ 1125 , 1127 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ( finding no suggestion to modify a prior art device where the modification would render the device inoperable for its intended purpose ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Denso argues that the court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law because the invention of the claims would have been obvious over U.S. Patent No . 3,136,001 ( `` the Gelbard patent '' ) in combination with the brass plug method . Although Tec Air disclosed the Gelbard patent to the Patent and Trademark Office during prosecution of the Swin patents , the details of the brass plug method were not before the examiner . The Gelbard patent teaches using adjustable screws to create balance lugs on the blade tips of a molded fan . Unlike the screws of the Swin patents , these screws are accessible from the rear of the mold . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because , in the brass plug method , the operator drills the brass plugs from the cavity-side of the mold , combining this method with the teachings of the Gelbard patent results in cavity-side accessible screws . The Gelbard patent teaches , however , that each of its adjustable threaded members has `` a non-threaded or smooth tip extending into a recess , '' which comes into contact with the molten plastic . Col. 1 , ll . 64-67 . This teaching is consistent with the conventional wisdom as late as 1974 , which counseled against arranging screw heads to face the cavity-side of the mold because molten plastic would ( 1 ) enter the screw slot , which would be difficult to remove , and ( 2 ) likely seep behind the screw head and jam the screw , according to Tec Air 's expert , Dr. Williamson . Because the brass plugs-Gelbard patent combination would be inoperable for its intended purpose-no screw driver would be able to turn the smooth-headed screws from the cavity-side of the mold-the jury reasonably could have found that the Gelbard patent taught away from its combination with the brass plug method . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Alternatively , even assuming that Denso established a prima facie case of obviousness , Tec Air presented sufficient objective evidence of nonobviousness to rebut it . `` [ O ] bjective evidence of non-obviousness may be used to rebut a prima facie case of obviousness based on prior art references . '' WMS Gaming Inc. v. International Game Tech. , 184 F.3d 1339 , 1359 , 51 USPQ2d 1385 , 1400 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . This type of evidence `` may include commercial success [ and ] long-felt but unsolved need . '' Id . `` Whether the evidence presented suffices to rebut the prima facie case is part of the ultimate conclusion of obviousness and is therefore a question of law . '' In re Rouffet , 149 F.3d 1350 , 1355 , 47 USPQ2d 1453 , 1456 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ According to the trial court , Tec Air presented evidence that millions of fans were sold by both Tec Air and Denso and that the patented method eliminated the `` tedious , haphazard , and expensive process of drilling the surface of the mold cavity . '' Based on Tec Air 's sales evidence , the jury reasonably could have found that the invention enjoyed commercial success . Denso argues that this evidence *1361 is insufficient because Tec Air failed to provide market share data . Although sales figures coupled with market data provide stronger evidence of commercial success , sales figures alone are also evidence of commercial success . See Cable Elec . Prods. , Inc. v. Genmark , Inc. , 770 F.2d 1015 , 1027 , 226 USPQ 881 , 888 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( `` [ I ] nformation [ about market share ] might bolster the existence in fact of any commercial success ... demonstrated by [ mere sales data ] ... . '' ) , overruled on other grounds by Midwest Indus. , Inc. v. Karavan Trailers , Inc. , 175 F.3d 1356 , 1358-61 , 50 USPQ2d 1672 , 1674-76 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( en banc ) ; see also In re Huang , 100 F.3d 135 , 140 , 40 USPQ2d 1685 , 1689 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` This court has noted in the past that evidence related solely to the number of units sold provides a very weak showing of commercial success , if any . `` ) ; see , e.g. , Gambro Lundia AB v. Baxter Healthcare Corp. , 110 F.3d 1573 , 1579 , 42 USPQ2d 1378 , 1384 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( `` [ T ] he record contains significant evidence of the commercial success of [ the ] invention . The record shows that [ a competitor ] sold over 14,800 dialysis machines allegedly incorporating the [ claimed ] invention since 1987 . `` ) ; J.T . Eaton & Co. v. Atlantic Paste & Glue Co. , 106 F.3d 1563 , 1566 , 1572 , 41 USPQ2d 1641 , 1643 , 1648 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( affirming a finding that `` sales evidence ... shows [ strong commercial ] success , '' where the `` sales evidence '' consisted solely of the patentee 's `` $ 17 million of sales from 1979 through 1984 , and its $ 4 million of annual sales from 1985 through 1989 '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Denso also argues that Tec Air failed to show a nexus between the sales and the patented invention . `` A prima facie case of nexus is generally made out when the patentee shows both that there is commercial success , and that the thing ( product or method ) that is commercially successful is the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent . '' Demaco Corp. v. F. Von Langsdorff Licensing Ltd. , 851 F.2d 1387 , 1392 , 7 USPQ2d 1222 , 1226 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . The evidence shows that Tec Air sold approximately two million fans per month , all of which were made according to the patented method . See Akzo N.V. v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 808 F.2d 1471 , 1481 , 1 USPQ2d 1241 , 1246 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) ( finding commercial success where a product made by a patented method was commercially successful ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ According to the trial court , Tec Air also offered testimony that `` there was a long-felt but unmet need to create a more efficient method to achieve fan balance '' prior to the Swin patents . Swin , Sr. testified that Tec Air used several unsatisfactory balancing techniques before adopting the patented one . Dr. Williamson testified that the industry experienced problems with the prior art machining methods . Moreover , after Denso ceased infringing the Swin patents , it had to resort to less effective methods of balancing the fans . Based on this evidence , the jury reasonably could have found there was a long-felt but unmet need in the prior art for an improved balancing method , which the Swin patents satisfied . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In light of this objective evidence of nonobviousness and the lack of evidence of a suggestion to combine the references , the court properly denied Denso 's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the obviousness issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Damages _NEWLINE_ In addition to arguing that the court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the damages issue , Denso argues that the court should have granted a new trial on this issue . We review the trial court 's denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion . See DMI , Inc. v. Deere & Co. , 802 F.2d 421 , 427 , 231 USPQ 276 , 280 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) . `` That question turns on whether an error occurred in the conduct of the trial that was so grievous as to have rendered the trial unfair . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1362 The jury awarded damages based on the entire market value rule , `` which permits recovery of damages based on the value of the entire apparatus containing several features , where the patent related feature is the basis for customer demand . '' State Indus. , Inc. v. Mor-Flo Indus. , Inc. , 883 F.2d 1573 , 1580 , 12 USPQ2d 1026 , 1031 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) . The entire market value rule is appropriate where both the patented and unpatented components together are `` analogous to components of a single assembly , '' `` parts of a complete machine , '' or `` constitute a functional unit , '' but not where the unpatented components `` have essentially no functional relationship to the patented invention and ... may have been sold with an infringing device only as a matter of convenience or business advantage . '' Rite-Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co. , 56 F.3d 1538 , 1550 , 35 USPQ2d 1065 , 1073 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( en banc ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Denso argues that the jury could not have reasonably found that ( 1 ) the patented and unpatented components comprised a single functional unit and ( 2 ) the basis for the customer demand was the method of balancing the fan inside the assembly . Denso 's damage expert testified that the motors used with the radiator and condenser assemblies required fans . Denso did not sell these assemblies without fans . Denso 's internal documents stress , moreover , that the performance and price of the entire system were paramount to its customers . This evidence amply supports the finding that the assemblies were a single functional unit . In addition , the evidence shows that customers wanted fans that were balanced to a certain specification and once Denso abandoned the patented method , it could not meet the 2.0 gm-cm balance specification . Denso argues that its customers did not care how the fans in the assemblies were balanced . However , after Denso changed its specification , one customer complained and required Denso to rebalance the fans . From this evidence , the jury could have reasonably concluded that the demand for the entire assembly depended on the patented invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , the jury properly applied the entire market value rule and Denso failed to demonstrate that the trial court legally erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law or abused its discretion in declining to grant a new trial on the damages issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Conclusion _NEWLINE_ Accordingly , the judgment of United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 192 F.3d 1353 , 52 U.S.P.Q.2d 1294

( `` Perfect Web '' ) appeals a summary judgment order holding that the asserted claims of its U.S. Patent No . 6,631,400 ( `` ¡¬400 patent '' ) are invalid . Perfect Web Techs. , Inc. v. InfoUSA , Inc. , No . 07-CV-80286 ( S.D.Fla . Oct. 24 , 2008 ) ( `` Opinion `` ) . Because we agree with the district court that the asserted claims would have been obvious , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1326 BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬400 patent claims methods of managing bulk e-mail distribution to groups of targeted consumers . The ¡¬400 patent 's application was filed on April 13 , 2000 , at a time when , according to the specification , the Internet was at an `` early and fervent stage of development . '' ¡¬400 patent col.1 ll.25-27 . The patent recognizes that `` electronic mail ( email ) is an often used component of the Internet . '' Id . col.1 ll.27-28 . In describing `` opt-in bulk e-mailing services , '' the patent explains that distributors access lists of customers who express subject matter preferences for commercial e-mail . Id . col.1 l.56 . The patented invention involves comparing the number of successfully delivered e-mail messages in a delivery against a predetermined desired quantity , and if the delivery does not reach the desired quantity , repeating the process of selecting and e-mailing a group of customers until the desired number of delivered messages has been achieved . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Perfect Web asserted claims 1 , 2 , 5 , 11 , 12 , and 15 against InfoUSA , Inc . Independent claim 1 represents the asserted claims : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A method for managing bulk e-mail distribution comprising the steps : _NEWLINE_ ( A ) matching a target recipient profile with a group of target recipients ; _NEWLINE_ ( B ) transmitting a set of bulk e-mails to said target recipients in said matched group ; _NEWLINE_ ( C ) calculating a quantity of e-mails in said set of bulk e-mails which have been successfully received by said target recipients ; and , _NEWLINE_ ( D ) if said calculated quantity does not exceed a prescribed minimum quantity of successfully received e-mails , repeating steps ( A ) - ( C ) until said calculated quantity exceeds said prescribed minimum quantity . _NEWLINE_ Dependent claim 2 adds the step of choosing a subset of the targeted group for e-mail distribution . Claim 5 also depends from claim 1 and specifies that the list of targeted recipients is an `` opt-in list . '' Claim 11 is an independent apparatus claim to a `` machine readable storage '' with a `` computer program '' that performs the method of claim 1 . Claims 12 and 15 depend from claim 11 and mirror claims 2 and 5 , respectively . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the district court , the parties filed a joint claim chart and separate memoranda of law addressing claim construction . InfoUSA moved for summary judgment of invalidity . After conducting a Markman hearing , but without issuing a formal claim construction order , the district court convened a summary judgment hearing . The court then granted InfoUSA 's motion , assuming for summary judgment purposes that Perfect Web 's claim constructions were correct . Opinion at 1 n. 1 . It first concluded that claim 1 would have been obvious under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 because steps ( A ) - ( C ) of the claimed methods appear in the prior art and step ( D ) `` would be obvious to virtually anyone . '' Id . at 7 . Moreover , the court found that claim 1 was anticipated under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 ( b ) by a company called the EmailChannel , which allegedly performed the claimed method in public before the patent 's critical date . Id . at 15 . Additionally , the court held that claim 1 did not constitute patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 101 because it was `` merely a series of algorithms . '' Id . at 18 . Finally , the court concluded that all of the dependent claims were also invalid as obvious , anticipated , and/or directed to ineligible subject matter . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Perfect Web appealed , and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2006 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1327 DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ `` We review a district court 's grant of summary judgment de novo , reapplying the standard applicable at the district court . '' Young v. Lumenis , Inc. , 492 F.3d 1336 , 1345 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . Summary judgment is proper if there is `` no genuine issue as to any material fact '' and `` the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law . '' Fed.R.Civ.P . 56 ( c ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Obviousness _NEWLINE_ `` Obviousness is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact . '' In re Kubin , 561 F.3d 1351 , 1355 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . The underlying factual inquiries are : ( 1 ) the scope and content of the prior art , ( 2 ) the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue , ( 3 ) the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art , and ( 4 ) secondary considerations of nonobviousness . KSR Int ' l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 406 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) ( citing Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court began its obviousness analysis by stating that the relevant art in the ¡¬400 patent is `` the art of e-mail marketing , '' and that the person of ordinary skill in that art possessed `` at least a high school diploma , one year of experience in the industry , and proficiency with computers and e-mail programs . '' Opinion at 6 . It then found that the prior art and ¡¬400 patent specification showed that steps ( A ) - ( C ) of the claim 1 method were previously known . According to the court , `` [ t ] he question then becomes whether e-mail marketers of ordinary skill would have repeated the first three steps to deliver a prescribed quantity of e-mail to targeted recipients , '' as called for in step ( D ) . Id . at 7 . Citing the Supreme Court 's teaching in KSR that `` [ a ] person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary creativity , not an automaton , '' the court found step ( D ) obvious : `` the final step is merely the logical result of common sense application of the maxim 'try , try again . ' `` Id . at 11 . The district court rejected Perfect Web 's alleged secondary considerations of nonobviousness because Perfect Web failed to establish the necessary nexus between InfoUSA 's gross revenue and the invention to show commercial success and introduced insufficient evidence of a long-felt need for the invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , the parties have narrowed the obviousness controversy to a select few issues . Perfect Web does not contest the district court 's analysis of the first three Graham factors , including the definition of ordinary skill in the pertinent art . Perfect Web 's Br . 46 . Perfect Web also `` assumes for purposes of this appeal that at least one prior art reference discloses the first three steps '' of claim 1 . Id . Furthermore , Perfect Web makes no obviousness arguments specific to the other asserted claims ( 2 , 5 , 11 , 12 , and 15 ) , urging only that `` those claims are valid for the reasons set forth regarding claim 1 . '' Id . at 58 ; see also SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp. , 439 F.3d 1312 , 1319 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( noting that `` arguments not raised in the opening brief are waived '' ) . Meanwhile , InfoUSA concedes that step ( D ) does not appear in the prior art . Opinion at 7 . As to secondary considerations , Perfect Web now asserts only long-felt need , not commercial success . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Perfect Web argues that there are factual disputes on two issues : whether `` common sense '' would have taught step ( D ) , and the presence of a long-felt need . It argues that common sense or knowledge `` must be rooted in evidence and factual findings , '' because they play `` the same role as the inquiry into whether the prior art contains any teaching , suggestion or motivation ( 'TSM ' ) that would have led a person *1328 of ordinary skill to produce the claimed invention . '' Perfect Web 's Br . 48-49 . Perfect Web contends that the district court improperly viewed the invention through a hindsight-tinted lens , misconstrued step ( D ) to mean `` try , try again , '' and discounted expert testimony that the patent was not a common-sense advance . Perfect Web also claims that the field of e-mail marketing had an unmet need for the invention because the industry previously relied on `` oversending , '' which involved sending an excess of messages to ensure delivery to the desired quantity of recipients , in the process wasting resources and annoying consumers without guaranteeing delivery . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response , InfoUSA reiterates its position that step ( D ) was a common-sense addition to steps ( A ) - ( C ) , citing its experts ' opinions . It also argues that repetition of the selection and transmission steps would have been obvious to try because there were , at most , two or three predictable solutions at the time for ensuring e-mail delivery . Finally , InfoUSA claims that Perfect Web 's assertion of long-felt need lacks evidentiary support or sufficient weight to overcome an otherwise strong case of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . `` Common Sense '' _NEWLINE_ In rejecting rigid application of the `` teaching , suggestion , or motivation '' test for obviousness , the Supreme Court observed that common sense can be a source of reasons to combine or modify prior art references to achieve the patented invention . In KSR , the Court offered guidance that has now been cited repeatedly : _NEWLINE_ When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified , predictable solutions , a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp . If this leads to the anticipated success , it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense . In that instance the fact that a combination was obvious to try might show that it was obvious under ¡± 103 . _NEWLINE_ 550 U.S. at 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ( emphasis added ) . While the Court warned against `` the distortion caused by hindsight bias and ... ex post reasoning , '' it also noted : `` Common sense teaches ... that familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their primary purposes , and in many cases a person of ordinary skill will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle . '' Id . at 420-21 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Common sense has long been recognized to inform the analysis of obviousness if explained with sufficient reasoning . Our predecessor court stated in In re Bozek , an appeal from the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences , that it was proper for a patent examiner to rely on `` common knowledge and common sense of the person of ordinary skill in the art without any specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference . '' 57 C.C.P.A . 713 , 416 F.2d 1385 , 1390 ( 1969 ) ( quotation marks omitted ) . We later clarified that an examiner may not invoke `` good common sense '' to reject a patent application without some factual foundation , where `` basic knowledge and common sense was not based on any evidence in the record . '' In re Zurko , 258 F.3d 1379 , 1383 , 1385 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . We explained that when the PTO rejects a patent for obviousness , it `` must not only assure that the requisite findings are made , based on evidence of record , but must also explain the reasoning by which the findings are deemed to support the agency 's conclusion . '' In re Lee , 277 F.3d 1338 , 1344 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . Lee recognized that , under Bozek , even though common knowledge and common sense do not substitute *1329 for facts , `` they may be applied to analysis of the evidence . '' Id . at 1345 . At the time , we required the PTO to identify record evidence of a teaching , suggestion , or motivation to combine references because `` [ o ] mission of a relevant factor required by precedent is both legal error and arbitrary agency action . '' Id . at 1344 . However , this did not preclude examiners from employing common sense . More recently , we explained that that use of common sense does not require a `` specific hint or suggestion in a particular reference , '' only a reasoned explanation that avoids conclusory generalizations . DyStar Textilfarben GmbH v. C.H . Patrick Co. , 464 F.3d 1356 , 1366 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ; see also In re Kahn , 441 F.3d 977 , 987 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( requiring `` some rationale , articulation , or reasoned basis to explain why the conclusion of obviousness is correct '' ) . And since KSR , this court has recognized that obviousness is not subject to a `` rigid formula , '' and that `` common sense of those skilled in the art demonstrates why some combinations would have been obvious where others would not . '' Leapfrog Enters . v. Fisher-Price , Inc. , 485 F.3d 1157 , 1161 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In counseling that courts `` need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim , '' the Supreme Court clarified that courts may look to a wider diversity of sources to bridge the gap between the prior art and a conclusion of obviousness . KSR , 550 U.S. at 418 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . We previously noted that `` [ t ] he reason , suggestion , or motivation to combine may be found explicitly or implicitly : 1 ) in the prior art references themselves ; 2 ) in the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art that certain references , or disclosures in those references , are of special interest or importance in the field ; or 3 ) from the nature of the problem to be solved ... . '' Ruiz v. A.B . Chance Co. , 234 F.3d 654 , 665 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . KSR expanded the sources of information for a properly flexible obviousness inquiry to include market forces ; design incentives ; the `` interrelated teachings of multiple patents '' ; `` any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent '' ; and the background knowledge , creativity , and common sense of the person of ordinary skill . 550 U.S. at 418-21 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When considering these sources , the Supreme Court remarked that `` [ r ] igid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense , however , are neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it . '' Id . at 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . Thus , the Supreme Court instructed that factfinders may use common sense in addition to record evidence . As an example of this flexibility , KSR noted that courts should avoid `` overemphasis on the importance of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents . '' Id . at 419 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . Nor are expert opinions always a prerequisite , for `` [ i ] n many patent cases expert testimony will not be necessary because the technology will be easily understandable without the need for expert explanatory testimony . '' Centricut , LLC v. Esab Group , Inc. , 390 F.3d 1361 , 1369 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( quotation omitted ) ; see also Sundance , Inc. v. DeMonte Fabricating Ltd. , 550 F.3d 1356 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( affirming obviousness where `` [ t ] he technology is simple and neither party claims that expert testimony is required '' ) . We therefore hold that while an analysis of obviousness always depends on evidence that supports the required Graham factual findings , it also may include recourse to logic , judgment , and common sense available to the person of ordinary skill that do not necessarily require explication in any reference or expert opinion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1330 Although the obviousness analysis should `` take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ , '' the Supreme Court emphasized that this evidentiary flexibility does not relax the requirement that , `` [ t ] o facilitate review , this analysis should be made explicit . '' Id . at 418 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ( citing Kahn , 441 F.3d at 988 ( `` [ R ] ejections on obviousness grounds can not be sustained by mere conclusory statements ; instead , there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness. '' ) ) . `` [ T ] he analysis that 'should be made explicit ' refers not to the teachings in the prior art of a motivation to combine , but to the court 's analysis . '' Ball Aerosol & Specialty Container , Inc. v. Ltd. Brands , Inc. , 555 F.3d 984 , 993 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . We reiterate that , on summary judgment , to invoke `` common sense '' or any other basis for extrapolating from prior art to a conclusion of obviousness , a district court must articulate its reasoning with sufficient clarity for review . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , we find that the predicate evidence on which the district court based its `` common sense '' reasoning appears in the record , namely the facts that step ( D ) merely involves repeating earlier steps , and that a marketer could repeat those steps , if desired . The district court also adequately explained its invocation of common sense . In claim 1 , steps ( A ) - ( C ) involve targeting a group of recipients , sending e-mail to those recipients , and calculating the number of successfully delivered e-mails . Perfect Web concedes that prior art references disclose these three steps . Step ( D ) , the only remaining step , recites `` repeating steps ( A ) - ( C ) until said calculated quantity exceeds said prescribed minimum quantity . '' Thus , this last step , and the claim as a whole , simply recites repetition of a known procedure until success is achieved . Recognizing this , the district court explained : `` If 100 e-mail deliveries were ordered , and the first transmission delivered only 95 , common sense dictates that one should try again . One could do little else . '' Opinion at 7-8 . If the relevant technology were complex , the court might require expert opinions . E.g. , Procter & Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharms . USA , Inc. , 566 F.3d 989 , 996-98 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( crediting expert testimony of unexpected results ) . Here , however , the parties agreed that ordinary skill in the relevant art required only a high school education and limited marketing and computer experience . No expert opinion is required to appreciate the potential value to persons of such skill in this art of repeating steps ( A ) - ( C ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While not necessary in this case , the submitted expert evidence fully supports the district court 's conclusion that claim 1 would have been obvious as a matter of common sense . InfoUSA offered two expert opinions that repetition would have been known to a person of ordinary skill . Reggie Brady , an `` e-mail marketing '' authority , stated : `` If a marketer insisted on an absolute delivered quantity and the initial transmission fell short , there would have been no other recourse but to repeat the matching , transmitting and calculating steps . '' J.A . 2748 ? 44 . John Lawlor , who worked in the `` advertising/marketing business , '' claimed that `` it would have been obvious to the email services company to repeat the matching , transmitting and calculating steps until the mailer 's order had been filled . '' Id . 2732 ? 31 . Even though Perfect Web challenged Lawlor 's credibility regarding his dual role as a fact witness for anticipation purposes , it did not rebut Lawlor 's obviousness testimony nor provide contradictory evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1331 Perfect Web claims that it refuted InfoUSA 's experts with the declaration of its own expert , Dr. Sandeep Krishnamurthy , a professor of marketing and e-commerce . Krishnamurthy opined that `` mere common sense and a general knowledge in the art-by one of ordinary skill-would not render the asserted claims of the ¡¬400 Patent obvious . '' J.A . 1957 . This statement , however , is not directly on point because it was made at the conclusion of a three-paragraph obviousness analysis of a combination of three prior art patents that are no longer at issue . Moreover , the district court correctly observed that in a deposition , Krishnamurthy agreed that if an initial delivery of e-mail fell short of a desired number , the only options were to stop or to find more e-mail addresses . J.A . 2358-59 at 226:13-24 , 229:8-17 . Krishnamurthy did testify that there were `` many parts '' to finding more e-mail addresses , id. , but this relates only to step ( A ) , which the prior art teaches . In sum , Krishnamurthy 's declaration and deposition testimony reveal that his opinion relied on irrelevant prior art , did not address the references that Perfect Web admits disclose steps ( A ) - ( C ) , and said nothing about the nonobviousness of repeating steps ( A ) - ( C ) . His opinion is therefore insufficient to prevent summary judgment . The testimony of the experts does nothing to question the correctness of the district court 's conclusion that performing the recited prior art method of steps ( A ) - ( C ) more than once as called for in step ( D ) was one of the `` inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill would employ . '' KSR , 550 U.S. at 418 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Obvious to Try _NEWLINE_ The record also shows that step ( D ) would have been obvious to try . The problem that the patent addresses is sending too few or too many e-mail messages to meet a fixed marketing quota . Krishnamurthy , Brady , and Lawlor collectively identified at most a few potential solutions for this problem at the time : ( 1 ) oversending , or e-mailing an excess of addresses to ensure the quota is met ; ( 2 ) if some addresses failed or `` bounced '' back messages , re-sending to those same addresses in the hope that a second transmission somehow succeeds ; and ( 3 ) identifying a new group of addresses and sending messages to them , which is step ( D ) in the ¡¬400 patent . Even without experimentation , simple logic suggests that sending messages to new addresses is more likely to produce successful deliveries than re-sending messages to addresses that have already failed . Perfect Web presented no evidence that the patented method offered any unexpected results or was not reasonably expected to succeed ; indeed , the predictable and actual result of performing step ( D ) is that more e-mail messages reach more recipients . There was thus a `` finite number of identified , predictable solutions '' to suggest that the ¡¬400 patent 's methods would have been obvious to try . Id . at 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . As the Supreme Court explained , if trying such a limited number of solutions `` leads to the anticipated success , it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense . '' Id . ( emphasis added ) . Meanwhile , no evidence indicates that a person of ordinary skill would have needed to `` vary all parameters or try each of numerous possible choices , '' or `` explore a new technology or general approach ... where the prior art gave only general guidance as to the particular form of the claimed invention or how to achieve it , '' which would counsel against an invention being obvious to try . Kubin , 561 F.3d at 1359 ( quoting In re O'Farrell , 853 F.2d 894 , 903 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1332 As noted , supra , the parties agreed that a person of ordinary skill possessed `` at least a high school diploma , one year of experience in the industry , and proficiency with computers and e-mail programs . '' Opinion at 6 . Perfect Web argues that such a person was `` unsophisticated '' and had `` no knowledge of computer programming or system design . '' Perfect Web 's Br . 57 . However , Perfect Web does not explain how programming experience was necessary to appreciate the value of repeating known methods . Moreover , this position is merely attorney argument lacking evidentiary support . See Gemtron Corp. v. Saint-Gobain Corp. , 572 F.3d 1371 , 1380 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( noting that `` unsworn attorney argument ... is not evidence '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. Claim Construction _NEWLINE_ Perfect Web also claims that the district court should have construed the claims before deciding validity . We have said that `` a court may not invalidate the claims of a patent without construing the disputed limitations of the claims and applying them to the allegedly invalidating acts . '' Dana Corp. v. Am . Axle & Mfg. , 279 F.3d 1372 , 1376 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . However , a district court need not `` construe undisputed claim terms prior to issuing a summary judgment of invalidity . '' Unitherm Food Sys . v. Swift-Eckrich , Inc. , 375 F.3d 1341 , 1350 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( emphasis added ) , rev 'd on other grounds , 546 U.S. 394 , 126 S.Ct . 980 , 163 L.Ed.2d 974 ( 2006 ) . Here , Perfect Web conceded that steps ( A ) - ( C ) exist in the prior art . In step ( D ) , the parties disputed only two terms : `` said calculated quantity '' and `` prescribed minimum quantity . '' See Joint Cl . Chart 3 ; Pl . 's Reply Mem . on Cl . Constr . Neither claim term was relevant to the obviousness of repeating steps ( A ) - ( C ) . The district court did not adopt InfoUSA 's constructions of these terms in its summary judgment opinion , and Perfect Web offers no reason why they would change the obviousness outcome . Because the district court referred to step ( D ) as `` try , try again , '' Perfect Web claims that the court adopted an improper `` claim construction '' that oversimplified the claims . But we see no error here ; step ( D ) plainly calls for `` repeating steps ( A ) - ( C ) , '' and Perfect Web identifies no construction that would change our analysis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D. Long-Felt Need _NEWLINE_ Evidence that an invention satisfied a long-felt and unmet need that existed on the patent 's filing date is a secondary consideration of nonobviousness . See Procter & Gamble , 566 F.3d at 998 . Perfect Web claims that the ¡¬400 patent solved a long-felt need for an efficient bulk e-mail system . Krishnamurthy identified `` two unique problems '' with systems available before April 2000 that employed oversending . First , marketers needed to transmit excess e-mail messages for which they received no payment . Second , more customers opted out of such systems because they received too many unwanted messages . J.A . 1958 . One of InfoUSA 's experts , Brady , agreed that oversending could result in `` losing money '' and `` burning up '' a list of available addresses . Id . at 1909 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Even assuming , as we must for summary judgment , that Perfect Web is factually correct about the drawbacks of oversending , Perfect Web fails to show that these drawbacks constituted a long-felt , unmet need alleviated by the patent . Perfect Web provided no evidence to explain how long this need was felt , or when the problem first arose . See Tex . Instruments v. U.S. Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 988 F.2d 1165 , 1178 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) ( `` [ L ] ong-felt need is analyzed as of the date of an articulated identified problem and evidence *1333 of efforts to solve that problem. '' ) . Nor does the evidence show that the ¡¬400 patent met any such `` need . '' Krishnamurthy made the bare assertion that the patent provided `` improved efficiency , '' J.A . 1959 , but cited no supporting data to show , for example , that the invention actually reduced marketing costs , time , or the number of consumers who opt out . `` Moreover , as we have often held , evidence of secondary considerations does not always overcome a strong prima facie showing of obviousness . '' Asyst Techs. , Inc. v. Emtrak , Inc. , 544 F.3d 1310 , 1316 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( affirming judgment as a matter of law of obviousness ) . In the end , Perfect Web 's unsupported contentions are legally insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because we agree with the district court 's holding of obviousness as to all asserted claims , we need not and do not reach its alternative reasons for holding the ¡¬400 patent invalid-namely , that the claims were anticipated and directed to unpatentable subject matter . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we conclude that claims 1 , 2 , 5 , 11 , 12 , and 15 of the ¡¬400 patent are invalid for obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 587 F.3d 1324 , 92 U.S.P.Q.2d 1849

Defendants Baxter Pharmaceutical Products , Inc. and Baxter Healthcare Corp. ( collectively `` Baxter '' ) cross-appeal the district court 's determination that the asserted claims are valid and its refusal to find unenforceability due to inequitable conduct . *1365 This is our second hearing of this case ; following our first , we reversed the district court 's claim construction and remanded for trial . Abbott Labs . v. Baxter Pharm . Prods. , Inc. , 334 F.3d 1274 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . The district court conducted a bench trial , then further construed the claims at issue and found them valid and enforceable but not infringed . Abbott Labs v. Baxter Pharm . Prods. , Inc. , No . 01-CV-1867 , 2005 WL 2347221 ( N.D.Ill . Sept. 26 , 2005 ) . This appeal timely followed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because we hold the asserted claims of the ¡¬176 patent to be anticipated by the disclosure in U.S. Patent No . 5,684,211 ( `` the ¡¬211 patent '' ) , we reverse the district court 's validity judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . The technology _NEWLINE_ Sevoflurane is a fast-acting , highly effective inhalation anesthetic . However , pure sevoflurane has a serious problem , unknown at the time of its invention and original shipment : it degrades in the presence of Lewis acids . Lewis acids are essentially defined as any species with an empty electron orbit leading to electron affinity and are common enough that avoiding exposure of sevoflurane to Lewis acids is quite difficult . Among the products of the degradation reaction is hydrofluoric acid , which is highly dangerous if inhaled . ¡¬176 patent col.1 ll.52-57 . The original containers in which Abbott shipped its product had Lewis acids exposed on their interiors . The hydrofluoric acid thus produced etched the containers ' glass surfaces , exposing even more Lewis acids , resulting in a vicious-cycle cascading reaction that seriously compromised Abbott 's product while on the shelf and forced a recall . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After investigating the cause of the degradation , Abbott discovered the source of the problem . It also found a solution : water mixed in with sevoflurane will bind to and deactivate Lewis acids , protecting the sevoflurane from the degradation reaction . A deliberate addition of water to sevoflurane ran counter to the conventional wisdom at the time : previously , Abbott had sought to minimize its product 's water content . Abbott filed a patent application on the degradation-preventing combination of water or other `` Lewis acid inhibitors '' with sevoflurane , which issued as the ¡¬176 patent at issue here . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Prior proceedings _NEWLINE_ Baxter sought to ship its own sevoflurane product . On January 26 , 2001 , it filed an amended Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) with the Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) covering its own sevoflurane product . Baxter filed with the FDA a certification of noninfringement and invalidity of the ¡¬ 176 patent pursuant to 21 U.S.C . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) ( commonly known as a `` paragraph IV certification '' ) , which created the cause of action giving rise to this suit under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There are multiple product and method claims at issue . Claim 1 of the ¡¬ 176 patent is representative : _NEWLINE_ An anesthetic composition comprising : a quantity of sevoflurane ; and a Lewis acid inhibitor in an amount effective to prevent degradation by a Lewis acid of said quantity of sevoflurane , said Lewis acid inhibitor selected from the group consisting of water , butylated hydroxytoluene , methylparaben , propylparaben , propofol , and thymol . _NEWLINE_ '176 patent col. 11 ll.21-29 . The other claims at issue speak to using water specifically , methods of combining sevoflurane and Lewis acid inhibitors to produce the *1366 above-mentioned composition , or both . Id . at cols.11-12 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This case came before us for the first time when we reviewed the district court 's construction of the phrase `` amount effective to prevent degradation '' to require at least 131 parts per million ( `` ppm '' ) of water and its consequent summary judgment of noninfringement . Abbott , 334 F.3d at 1277 . We disagreed with that construction , noting that `` an effective amount of any given Lewis acid inhibitor will vary according to the conditions to which sevoflurane is subjected , '' making construction referencing particular ranges of water content inappropriate . Id . at 1278 . We vacated the district court 's summary judgment and remanded . Id . at 1283 . On remand , the district court conducted a bench trial . It determined that the term `` to prevent degradation '' had been left unconstrued , Abbott , No . 01-CV-1867 , slip op . at 7 , and concluded that `` sevoflurane is degraded if it contains degradants in amounts greater than 300 ppm . '' Id . at 16 . It found Abbott 's literal infringement evidence to be unpersuasive , id . at 27 , and Abbott 's doctrine of equivalents argument to be barred by prosecution history estoppel , id . at 31 . It addressed Baxter 's claim that the patent was unenforceable due to inequitable conduct , but declined to so hold . Id . at 48 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Baxter made two distinct invalidity arguments . It first argued that since some lots of the pre-recall sevoflurane sold by Abbott had not degraded , there had been a prior sale which would bar the patent . The district court found insufficient evidence that those lots had actually been exposed to Lewis acids , making a finding that they had contained water `` in an amount effective to prevent degradation '' unsupportable . Id . at 44 . Baxter 's second argument was that the ¡¬211 patent disclosed a composition of water-saturated sevoflurane that met all the limitations of the asserted claims . Id . at 37-39 . The district court noted some of our holdings finding anticipation even where , as here , there was no knowledge at the time of the relevant properties of the prior art . Id . at 40-41 ( citing Atlas Powder Co. v. IRECO , Inc. , 190 F.3d 1342 , 1348-49 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ; SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp. , 403 F.3d 1331 , 1343-44 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ; Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharms. , Inc. , 339 F.3d 1373 , 1378-80 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ) . However , it concluded that the ¡¬211 patent did not anticipate . Id . at 43 . That decision was based on its reading of our decision in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Labs. , Inc. , in which we noted that `` [ n ] ewly discovered results of known processes directed to the same purpose are not patentable because such results are inherent . '' Id . at 42 ( quoting 246 F.3d 1368 , 1376 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( emphasis added by district court ) ) . It concluded that since the ¡¬211 patent disclosed an `` intermediate step '' in the manufacture of sevoflurane , `` the patent 's purpose was not to produce sevoflurane in its final useable form , '' in distinction to the purpose of the ¡¬176 patent , which `` involves a final step in production . '' Id . at 42 . The district court reasoned that since the patents ' purposes were different , the Bristol-Myers Squibb distinction foreclosed a finding of anticipation . Id . at 42-43 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All of these rulings by the district court are before us via either Abbott 's appeal or Baxter 's cross-appeal . Abbott challenges the claim construction , arguing that the intrinsic evidence of the ¡¬176 patent permits more than 4,000 ppm of impurities before the sevoflurane may be considered `` degraded . '' Abbott also challenges the district court 's findings on literal and doctrine of equivalents infringement . Baxter challenges enforceability and validity , the latter in light of both the ¡¬211 patent and *1367 the alleged prior sale . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Standard of review _NEWLINE_ Patent claims are presumed to be valid , 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 , and the party seeking to show invalidity must prove facts supporting invalidity by clear and convincing evidence . N. Am . Vaccine , Inc. v. Am . Cyanamid Co. , 7 F.3d 1571 , 1579 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) . Since this case comes to us from a trial without jury , we review the district court 's findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo . Panduit Corp. v. Dennison Mfg . Co. , 810 F.2d 1561 , 1565 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . The ¡¬211 patent _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬211 patent was applied for in 1995 and awarded to Kawai et al . in November 1997 . Appellant Central Glass Co. is the assignee . The parties do not dispute that the ¡¬211 patent predates the ¡¬176 patent for the purposes of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 , and the facts about what the ¡¬211 patent teaches are in relevant part undisputed . It discloses a technique for purifying sevoflurane for `` use [ ] as a pharmaceutical and particularly as an inhalation anesthetic , '' ¡¬211 patent abstract , which involves the addition of water . If the steps of its Illustration 1 , Table 2 are practiced , the result will be sevoflurane that is saturated with water , unable to absorb any more moisture . Saturation implies that the sevoflurane contains an amount of water sufficient to prevent it from degrading due to Lewis acids . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the time , however , knowledge of the beneficial nature of a water-sevoflurane mix was wholly lacking in the art . The district court describes the matter succinctly : _NEWLINE_ [ P ] rior to [ the ¡¬176 patent ] invention no one had any idea that Lewis acids had the potential to degrade sevoflurane . Further , no one was aware of the stabilizing effect water would have to prevent Lewis acid degradation . In fact , water was considered an impurity and was removed from sevoflurane to the extent possible during the manufacturing process that included the teachings of the ¡¬211 patent . _NEWLINE_ Abbott , No . 01-CV-1867 , slip op . at 39 , 2005 WL 2347221 . Thus , the ¡¬ 211 patent discloses a particular composition and claims a process for making that composition , but does not teach the advantageous feature of that composition whose discovery led to the patent in suit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. Unknown properties and anticipation _NEWLINE_ Our cases have consistently held that a reference may anticipate even when the relevant properties of the thing disclosed were not appreciated at the time . The classic case on this point is Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner , 778 F.2d 775 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . In Titanium Metals , the applicants sought patent protection on an alloy with previously unknown corrosion resistance and workability properties . Id . at 776 . The prior art reference was an article by two Russian scientists that disclosed in a few data points on its graphs an alloy falling within the scope of the claims of the patent in suit . Id . at 776-77 . There was no sign that the Russian authors or anyone else had understood the later-discovered features of the alloy thus described . Id . at 780-81 . Despite the fact that `` the applicants for patent had discovered or invented and disclosed knowledge which is not to be found in the reference , '' we held that the Russian article anticipated the asserted patent claims . Id . at 782 . The Titanium Metals rule has been repeatedly confirmed and applied by this court . See , e.g. , *1368 In re Crish , 393 F.3d 1253 , 1258-59 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( citing cases ; holding asserted claims covering a gene 's nucleotide sequence anticipated where the gene , though not its particular sequence , was already known to the art ) ; In re Cruciferous Sprout Litig. , 301 F.3d 1343 , 1349-50 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( inventor 's recognition of substances that render broccoli and cauliflower particularly healthy does not permit patent on identifying broccoli seeds or preparing broccoli as a food product ) ; Atlas Powder , 190 F.3d at 1347-1350 ( holding asserted claims covering air mixed into an explosive composition anticipated by prior art that necessarily also contained air as claimed , even though benefits of the air were not recognized ) . Indeed , the rule did not originate with Titanium Metals . See Ansonia Brass & Copper Co. v. Elec . Supply Co. , 144 U.S. 11 , 18 , 12 S.Ct . 601 , 36 L.Ed . 327 ( 1892 ) ( `` [ T ] he application of an old process or machine to a similar or analogous subject , with no change in the manner of application and no result substantially distinct in its nature , will not sustain a patent even if the new form of result had not before been contemplated . `` ) ; In re Pearson , 494 F.2d 1399 , 1403 ( C.C.P.A.1974 ) ( inventor 's recognition that prior-art compound inhibited defects in peanut plants did not suffice to grant patent protection on that compound ) ; In re Benner , 36 C.C.P.A . 1081 , 174 F.2d 938 , 942 ( 1949 ) ( `` [ N ] o provision has been made in the patent statutes for granting a patent upon an old product based solely upon discovery of a new use for such product. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The general principle that a newly-discovered property of the prior art can not support a patent on that same art is not avoided if the patentee explicitly claims that property . `` [ A ] prior art reference may anticipate without disclosing a feature of the claimed invention if that missing characteristic is necessarily present , or inherent , in the single anticipating reference . '' Schering , 339 F.3d at 1377 ( citing Continental Can Co. v. Monsanto Co. , 948 F.2d 1264 , 1268 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ) . `` [ I ] nherent anticipation does not require that a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time would have recognized the inherent disclosure . '' Id . ( citing Cruciferous Sprout , 301 F.3d at 1351 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Abbott 's objection here is merely that at the time of the ¡¬211 patent , nobody knew that the water-saturated sevoflurane that patent disclosed had the property of resisting the Lewis acid degradation reaction . Just as in Titanium Metals , that lack of knowledge is wholly irrelevant to the question of whether the ¡¬176 patent claims something `` new '' over the disclosure of the ¡¬211 patent ; the claimed property of resistance to degradation is found inherently in the disclosure . Since the ¡¬211 patent discloses sevoflurane saturated with water-i.e. , unable to absorb any additional water to further protect it from the degradation reaction-it anticipates the claims of the ¡¬176 patent . This is true under any definition of the term `` prevent degradation '' that the claims might reasonably bear , so we need not construe that phrase with numerical exactitude in order to reach our decision . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court nonetheless found the patent valid due to the purpose-based distinction we drew in Bristol-Myers Squibb . Abbott , No . 01-CV-1867 , slip op . at 42-43 ( citing 246 F.3d at 1376 ) . As a threshold matter , we note that that distinction is applicable only to process claims . Bristol-Myers Squibb states that `` new uses of known processes may be patentable , '' citing in support the definition of `` process '' found at 35 U.S.C . ¡± 100 ( b ) . 246 F.3d at 1376 . The case does not speak to composition claims ; the district court therefore committed legal error by applying it to sustain the validity of those claims of the ¡¬176 patent that cover a mixture of sevoflurane *1369 and water . As to the ¡¬176 patent 's process claims , we agree that Bristol-Myers Squibb needs to be considered , but we disagree with the concept that the processes described in the ¡¬176 patent are not `` directed to the same purpose , '' id. , under the meaning of Bristol-Myers Squibb . Both the ¡¬211 and the ¡¬176 patents disclose methods which help to ensure that sevoflurane will be of high purity at the time it is administered to patients . The ¡¬211 patent discloses a method of achieving that end by adding water and then distilling the solution , which results in removing impurities from the sevoflurane , while the ¡¬176 patent accomplishes the same objective by merely adding water , which results in safeguarding the sevoflurane against impurities generated by the presence of Lewis acids . All of the steps of the ¡¬176 patent are thus disclosed in the ¡¬211 patent in furtherance of the same purpose : the delivery of safe , effective sevoflurane anesthetic . All that is contributed by the method claims of the ¡¬176 patent is the recognition of a new property of the prior art process . We hold today , as we did in Bristol-Myers Squibb , that `` the claimed process here is not directed to a new use ; it is the same use . '' Id . ; see also Catalina Mktg . Int ' l , Inc. v. Coolsavings.com , Inc. , 289 F.3d 801 , 809-10 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( explaining that an inventor may not obtain a patent on a process having the same steps as a prior art process , in which the new process merely identifies a new , advantageous property of the prior art process ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We also do not find it material that the district court found the anticipating method in the ¡¬211 patent to be `` an intermediate step '' in the manufacture of sevoflurane . Abbott , No . 01-CV-1867 , slip op . at 42 . The product of that method was an anesthetic sevoflurane composition with sufficient water to prevent Lewis acid degradation-exactly what is claimed by the ¡¬176 patent . Commercial finality is not claimed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the reasons given above , we reverse the district court 's judgment that the asserted claims of the ¡¬176 patent are valid . Since all asserted claims are invalid , we do not reach questions of infringement or inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ No costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 471 F.3d 1363 , 80 U.S.P.Q.2d 1860

See Riverwood Int ' l Corp. v. Mead Corp. , No . 1:94-CV-0090-CAM ( N.D.Ga . Jan. 13 , 1999 ) ( `` Order '' ) . Because the district court erroneously concluded as a matter of law that the *1366 claims were not invalid for obviousness , we reverse . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Background _NEWLINE_ This appeal arises out of a patent infringement dispute over cartoners . Cartoners are machines designed to automatically group articles , such as beverage cans or bottles , and load them into paperboard cartons . Cartoners are usually used in industrial applications such as beverage bottling facilities . Riverwood owns the rights to the '806 patent , embodied in practice by its TwinStack model . Claim 1 and dependent claim 13 of the '806 patent are the only claims at issue . These two claims cover a cartoner with three incoming streams of articles and a barrel cam loader . This type of cartoner is known in the art as a three-conveyer cartoner . The loader , which is usually a barrel cam or an angulated guide in the prior art , forces the articles into the cartons . A barrel cam pushes the articles in a manner similar to a horizontal escalator , whereas an angulated guide works passively , merely providing a static wall or rail to divert the path of the otherwise propelled articles . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After Mead developed and marketed its DuoStack model , a three-conveyer cartoner with a barrel cam loader , Riverwood brought suit for infringement of the '806 patent . The district court appointed a special master pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 to hear evidence and arguments from the parties . The special master made findings of fact and concluded inter alia that claims 1 and 13 of the '806 patent were invalid for obviousness . See Riverwood Int ' l Corp. v. Mead Corp. , No . 1:94-CV-0090-CAM ( N.D.Ga . Mar . 11 , 1998 ) ( `` Report '' ) . The district court accepted the findings of fact in whole and without modification , but contrary to the special master , concluded that the claims would not have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art . See Order at 3 . Mead appeals this aspect of the district court 's judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Discussion _NEWLINE_ On appeal from a non-jury trial , the ultimate determination of whether the claims at issue would have been obvious under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 is a legal conclusion that we review de novo . See Robotic Vision Sys. , Inc. v. View Eng ' g , Inc. 189 F.3d 1370 , 1376 , 51 USPQ2d 1948 , 1953 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . An obviousness determination is based on underlying factual inquiries including : ( 1 ) the scope and content of the prior art ; ( 2 ) the differences between the prior art and the claims ; ( 3 ) the level of ordinary skill in the art ; and ( 4 ) objective evidence of nonobviousness . See Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 13-14 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 , 148 USPQ 459 , 465 ( 1966 ) ; Robotic Vision , 189 F.3d at 1376 , 51 USPQ2d at 1953 . In addition , when obviousness is based on particular prior art references , there must be a showing of a suggestion or motivation to combine the teachings of those references , though it need not be expressly stated . See B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Aircraft Braking Sys . Corp. , 72 F.3d 1577 , 1582-83 , 37 USPQ2d 1314 , 1318 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ; In re Fine , 837 F.2d 1071 , 1074 , 5 USPQ2d 1596 , 1598-99 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . In this case , the district court has accepted all of the special master 's findings of fact , and the appellant does not challenge any of them . Our task is to examine the findings related to the factors articulated in Graham and determine whether the district court erred by deciding that the claims were not obvious as a matter of law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) Scope and Content of the Prior Art and ( 2 ) Difference Between the Prior Art and the Claims _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 of the '806 patent contains four limitations : an infeed conveyer , an article selecting conveyor , a carton conveyor , and an article group transfer means . Claim 13 incorporates all the subject matter of claim 1 and adds a `` cam track/cam follower assembly '' to the fourth element . According to the special master , Riverwood stipulated that a patent in the prior *1367 art , U.S. Patent No . 3,778,959 to Langen ( `` the Langen patent '' ) , discloses the first three limitations of claim 1 . See Report at 10 . The special master found that the fourth limitation of claim 1 defines what is commonly known in the art as a `` barrel cam loader '' and that barrel cam loaders in cartoners were known in the prior art . See id . The special master also found that a `` cam track/cam follower assembly '' is a common structure used in barrel cam loaders , and concluded that `` claim 13 [ would have been ] obvious for the same reasons as claim 1 . '' Id . at 27 . In addition , the special master found that Langen `` first disclosed in that patent angulated fixed guide rails stating that angulated fixed guides are an improvement over 'escalators ' ( barrel cam loaders ) , not that escalators are not an obvious alternative ... . '' Id . at 11 . Upon examining the remainder of the prior art , the special master found that the prior art recognized the obviousness of substituting one type of loader for another in a cartoner . See id . at 11 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 3 ) Level of Skill in the Art _NEWLINE_ The special master found that one of ordinary skill in the art `` would be knowledgeable of problems and solutions to the design of cartoners '' and that `` ... the numerous prior patents in evidence show that there were numerous solutions developed to solve the problems and the solutions occurred relatively frequently in a relatively sophisticated and developed technology . '' Id . at 10 ; see Pro-Mold and Tool Co. v. Great Lakes Plastics , Inc. , 75 F.3d 1568 , 1573 , 37 USPQ2d 1626 , 1630 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . Thus , these findings support the conclusion that it would have been obvious to someone of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to replace the angulated fixed guide rail loader in the Langen patent with a barrel cam loader and that a suggestion or motivation to make that substitution existed in the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 4 ) Objective Factors _NEWLINE_ According to the special master , Riverwood presented some evidence of commercial success . He found , however , that much of that success was attributable to factors outside the scope of claims 1 and 13 of the '806 patent . See id . at 15 ; In re GPAC , 57 F.3d 1573 , 1580 , 35 USPQ2d 1116 , 1121 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( `` For objective evidence to be accorded substantial weight , its proponent must establish a nexus between the evidence and the merits of the claimed invention. '' ) . Finally , the special master found that there is no evidence that the Mead DuoStack was a copy of the TwinStack cartoner , that there was no long-felt need for an improvement in cartoners that was solved by the subject matter of the claims of the '806 patent , and that there was no significant evidence of the failure of others . See Report at 16 . Based on these findings , he determined that the objective factors did not carry sufficient weight to override a conclusion of obviousness based on the primary considerations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In view of all these findings , we are led to the ineluctable conclusion that claims 1 and 13 of the '806 patent are invalid . The district court 's conclusion of nonobviousness is not supportable by the facts found . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Conclusion _NEWLINE_ Accordingly , the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia is reversed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 212 F.3d 1365 , 54 U.S.P.Q.2d 1763

The district court found claims 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 of Iron Grip 's patent , U.S. Patent No . 6,436,015 ( `` the '015 patent '' ) , to be invalid as obvious . We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1319 BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Iron Grip is a manufacturer of weight plates used with fitness equipment such as barbells and is the assignee of the '015 patent . Claim 1 of the '015 patent claims : _NEWLINE_ A weight plate for physical fitness including : a plate body formed with a central throughbore and ... further formed with solely a triad of spaced apart elongated handle openings disposed generally equiangularly ... , said openings having respective outboard edges cooperating with said plate to define a triad of integral handle elements for grasping by a single hand to effect transport of said weight plate . _NEWLINE_ Id . col. 4 , ll . 24-35 ( emphasis added ) . The other claims in the '015 patent at issue here depend from claim 1 and are not different for present purposes . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Typically , a barbell consists of a rigid bar and removable weight plates attached on both ends . Traditional weight plates had a single hole in the center for attachment to the barbell . A key problem with traditional single-hole weight plates was that they were difficult to grasp and transport . Iron Grip 's '015 patent addresses this defect of traditional weight plates by disclosing a weight plate with three elongated openings near the periphery of the plate that function effectively as handles . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ During the prosecution of the '015 patent , Iron Grip disclosed prior art showing , inter alia , weight plates with one elongated grip , U.S. Patent No . 4,199,140 ( `` the '140 patent '' ) , and two elongated grips , U.S. Patent No . 5,137,502 ( `` the '502 patent '' ) . The examiner further considered other prior art including barbell weight plates with four openings . U.S. Patent No . 4,618,142 . After multiple rejections on grounds of obviousness , the '015 patent eventually issued on Aug. 20 , 2002 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ USA Sports , Inc. ( `` USA Sports '' ) is a competing manufacturer of weight plates . It also manufactures a three-grip plate . In May of 2002 , Iron Grip sued USA Sports in the district court for infringement of an unrelated patent , and subsequently amended its complaint to state an action for infringement of claims 1-3 and 6-8 of the '015 patent . USA Sports defended on the basis that the asserted claims in the '015 patent were invalid as obvious in light of the prior art . Both sides moved for summary judgment . The district court initially granted summary judgment in favor of Iron Grip , finding that USA Sport 's weight plate infringed the '015 patent ; and denied USA Sport 's summary judgment motion as to the invalidity of the '015 patent , holding that a finding of invalidity for obviousness required a `` suggestion , motivation , or teaching in the prior art to combine the elements [ from separate references ] . '' ( J.A . at 1897 . ) Upon motion for reconsideration , however , the district court held that the contested claims in the '015 patent were obvious . The district court found that its prior understanding of the law was `` unduly restrictive . '' ( J.A . at 2921 . ) Instead , it held that `` the cases ... permit the court to look at the overall picture of what 's really going on ... . The obviousness test ... calls upon the court to just simply exercise common sense ... . '' ( Id . ) Applying this new test , the district court held that `` it would have been obvious to a layman to combine the prior art , '' and invalidated claims 1-3 and 6-8 of the '015 patent . ( J.A . at 3 . ) Iron Grip appeals . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) .1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1320 DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ We review the district court 's grant of summary judgment without deference . Karsten Mfg . Corp. v. Cleveland Golf Co. , 242 F.3d 1376 , 1379 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . We therefore affirm the district court only if there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the invalidity of the claims . In making this determination , a patent is presumed to be valid . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 ( 2000 ) ; Cardinal Chem . Co. v. Morton Int ' l , 508 U.S. 83 , 93 n. 15 , 113 S.Ct . 1967 , 124 L.Ed.2d 1 ( 1993 ) . USA Sports bears the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence . Am . Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , Inc. , 725 F.2d 1350 , 1360 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In determining obviousness , we employ the four-part test set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) . This test requires us to examine ( 1 ) the scope and content of the prior art ; ( 2 ) the level of ordinary skill in the art ; ( 3 ) the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art ; and ( 4 ) the objective evidence of nonobviousness . Id . at 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 ; see also 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( 2000 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We note that neither side disputes that weight plates showing one , two and four elongated openings were within the prior art . We also note that neither side disputes that the proper level of ordinary skill in the art is that of a layman . Therefore , the only points of contention in the obviousness inquiry are the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art , and the objective evidence of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ We turn first to a comparison between the prior art and the claimed invention . In this inquiry , we are mindful of the repeated warnings of the Supreme Court and this court as to the danger of hindsight bias . See , e.g. , Graham , 383 U.S. at 36 , 86 S.Ct . 684 ( consideration of secondary factors `` serve [ s ] to guard against slipping into use of hindsight and to resist the temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue '' ( internal quotations and citations omitted ) ) ; In re Kotzab , 217 F.3d 1365 , 1369 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( `` [ T ] he very ease with which the invention can be understood may prompt one to fall victim to the insidious effect of a hindsight syndrome wherein that which only the invention taught is used against its teacher . '' ( internal quotations omitted ) ) . We note in this respect that the district court 's use of an `` overall picture '' and `` common sense '' test of obviousness falls squarely into the hindsight trap . See In re Lee , 277 F.3d 1338 , 1345 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Where an invention is contended to be obvious based upon a combination of elements across different references , our cases require that there be a suggestion , motivation or teaching to those skilled in the art for such a combination . In re Fine , 837 F.2d 1071 , 1074 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . This requirement prevents the use of `` the inventor 's disclosure as a blueprint for piecing together the prior art to defeat patentability-the essence of hindsight . '' Ecolochem , Inc. v. So . Cal . Edison Co. , 227 F.3d 1361 , 1371-72 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( quoting In re Dembiczak , 175 F.3d 994 , 999 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , however , obviousness does not arise from any combination of elements from the prior art . Rather , the issue of the '015 patent 's obviousness arises because the prior art showed one , two and four elongated handles on weight plates . A single elongated handle on a weight plate was disclosed by the '140 patent . Two elongated handles on a weight plate was disclosed by the '502 patent . Four elongated handles on a *1321 weight plate was disclosed by U.S. Design Patent No . 406 , 183 ( `` the '183 patent '' ) . Reproductions of the two and four grip weight plates in the prior art , and Iron Grip 's three-grip weight plate , appear below : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ The key feature of the '015 patent , the fact that there are three elongated handles , falls within a range disclosed by the prior art . Where the `` prior art ... discloses a range encompassing a somewhat narrower claimed range , '' the narrower range may be obvious . In re Peterson , 315 F.3d 1325 , 1330 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . `` [ W ] hen the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is the range or value of a particular variable , '' then a patent should not issue if `` the difference in range or value is minor . '' Haynes Int ' l v. Jessop Steel Co. , 8 F.3d 1573 , 1577 n. 3 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) ; see also Titanium Metals Corp. of Am . v. Banner , 778 F.2d 775 , 783 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( invention found obvious because it was close to prior art range ) . Thus simply because an invention falls within a range disclosed by the prior art does not necessarily make it per se obvious . Both the genus and species may be patentable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1322 Nonetheless , where there is a range disclosed in the prior art , and the claimed invention falls within that range , there is a presumption of obviousness . But the presumption will be rebutted if it can be shown : ( 1 ) That the prior art taught away from the claimed invention , In re Geisler , 116 F.3d 1465 , 1471 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ; or ( 2 ) that there are new and unexpected results relative to the prior art , In re Woodruff , 919 F.2d 1575 , 1578 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is , to be sure , one distinguishing feature of these range cases . Each involved a range disclosed within a single patent , while here the range is disclosed in multiple prior art patents . But , under the circumstances of this case , that is a distinction without a difference . The prior art suggested that a larger number of elongated grips in exercise weights was beneficial,2 thus plainly suggesting that one skilled in the art look to the range appearing in the prior art . The prior art disclosed weight plates with one , two and four elongated handles . Iron Grip is claiming a weight plate with three elongated handles , within the range of the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is also manifest that neither of the recognized exceptions applies here . First , Iron Grip offers no evidence that the prior art taught away from the invention besides the broad conclusory statement that `` the prior art ... taught towards fewer grips . '' ( Reply Br . of Appellant at 14 . ) The prior art does not support this conclusion . There is no evidence of `` sufficient teaching away . '' In re Malagari , 499 F.2d 1297 , 1303 ( C.C.P.A.1974 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , there has been no showing that the three grips led to unexpected results . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Where `` the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is some range or other variable within the claims ... , the [ patentee ] must show that the particular range is critical , generally by showing that the claimed range achieves unexpected results . '' Woodruff , 919 F.2d at 1578 . In the case of In re Huang , 100 F.3d 135 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) , we sustained a finding of obviousness in a situation somewhat similar to that involved here . In Huang , the claimed invention was a shock-absorbing grip with a polyurethane layer and a textile layer . The difference between the Huang grip and the prior art was that the Huang grip increased the thickness of the polyurethane layer relative to the textile layer , and had greater shock-absorbing qualities . There was nothing new or unexpected about this result because the prior art taught `` that shock absorption derives in part from the compressible nature of the polyurethane layer . Given that the polyurethane layer absorbs shock , one of ordinary skill would logically infer that increasing the amount of the shock absorbing material ( the polyurethane ) would lead to an increase in the amount of shock absorption . '' Id . at 139 . The invention was obvious because _NEWLINE_ Huang 's contribution to the art could only lie in the specific thickness ratios recited in the claims . This court and its predecessors have long held ... that even though [ a ] modification results in great improvement and utility over the prior art , it may still not be patentable if the modification was within the capabilities of one skilled in the art , unless the claimed ranges `` produce a new and unexpected result which is different in kind and not merely in degree from the results of the prior art . '' _NEWLINE_ *1323 Id . ( quoting In re Aller , 42 C.C.P.A . 824 , 220 F.2d 454 , 456 ( 1955 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is no indication of any new and unexpected results from the use of a three-grip plate in the '015 patent or the prosecution history . The only benefit Iron Grip discloses in the patent regarding a three-grip plate is that `` [ t ] his construction allows a user to quickly find a handle element quickly [ sic ] and effortlessly . '' '015 patent , col. 4 , ll . 3-4 . There is no explanation why , as compared to the two or four grip plates in the prior art , a three-grip plate has advantages in this regard . A review of the prosecution history is likewise uninformative . In addition to the benefit of allowing a user to find a handle quickly and effortlessly , the examiner cites the ability of the user to grasp the handles of the plate with two hands at an appropriate angle as a reason for allowing the claim . ( J.A . at 1237 ) . There is again no explanation of why such an effect could not likewise be achieved using a plate with two or four handles as existed in the prior art . We conclude that the patent and its prosecution history do not disclose any new and unexpected results from having three elongated grips on a weight plate . Nor has Iron Grip shown new and unexpected results based on evidence outside the patent and its prosecution history . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , Iron Grip argues that Huang is inapposite because it was an appeal from the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( `` Board '' ) , and submits that it stands for the proposition of deference to the examiner and the Board . There is no merit to Iron Grip 's contention . It is well-settled that `` [ o ] bviousness is a legal question based on underlying factual determinations , '' and in appeals from the Board `` [ w ] e review the ultimate legal determination of obviousness without deference . '' In re Zurko , 258 F.3d 1379 , 1383-84 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ; see In re McCarthy , 763 F.2d 411 , 412 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . Here there is no factual issue . On the legal issue of obviousness ( as opposed to the underlying factual issues ) the grant of a patent does not create a presumption of validity beyond the requirement that the party seeking to invalidate a patent must prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence . SSIH Equip . S.A. v. USITC , 718 F.2d 365 , 375 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because the claimed invention falls within a range disclosed in the prior art , and the patentee has not shown that the prior art taught away from the invention or new and unexpected results from a three elongated grip weight plate as compared to those in the prior art , we conclude that the claims are obvious absent substantial evidence of pertinent secondary factors supporting patentability.3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ We now consider whether the patentee has demonstrated secondary evidence of nonobviousness . We have previously held that in `` determining the question of obviousness , inquiry should always be made into whatever objective evidence of nonobviousness there may be . '' Vandenberg v. Dairy Equip . Co. , 740 F.2d 1560 , 1567 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) ; see also Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs . Inc. , 391 F.3d 1365 , 1373 n.9 , 2004 WL 2827673 , No . 04-1344 , slip op . at 12 n. 9 ( Fed.Cir . Dec. 10 , 2004 ) . The district court 's opinion here did not consider the patentee 's claimed evidence . `` Our precedents ... establish that failure to cite secondary *1324 considerations , alone , is not reversible error . '' Ruiz v. A.B . Chance Co. , 234 F.3d 654 , 668 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . `` Where the evidence of record is unchallenged as to secondary considerations ignored by the decision maker , this court may , as a matter of law , consider this objective evidence in reviewing the ultimate conclusion of obviousness/nonobviousness entered by the trial court '' without the need for a remand . Ashland Oil , Inc. v. Delta Resins & Refractories , Inc. , 776 F.2d 281 , 307 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . Because in considering this record evidence , we conclude that it does not show the existence of relevant secondary factors to support patentability , we affirm the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court has previously identified , inter alia , commercial success , satisfaction of a long-felt need , and copying to be relevant factors in this inquiry . See Demaco Corp. v. F. Von Langsdorff Licensing Ltd. , 851 F.2d 1387 , 1392 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( commercial success ) ; Uniroyal , Inc. v. Rudkin-Wiley Corp. , 837 F.2d 1044 , 1054 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( long-felt need ) ; Pro-Mold & Tool Co. v. Great Lakes Plastics , Inc. , 75 F.3d 1568 , 1574 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( copying ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Iron Grip has not made a showing of commercial success . Our cases make clear that a `` nexus must be established between the merits of the claimed invention and evidence of commercial success before that evidence may become relevant to the issue of obviousness . '' Solder Removal Co. v. USITC , 65 C.C.P.A . 120 , 582 F.2d 628 , 637 ( 1978 ) . Ordinarily , this nexus may be inferred when `` the patentee shows both that there is commercial success , and that the thing ( product or method ) that is commercially successful is the invention disclosed and claimed in the patent . '' Demaco , 851 F.2d at 1392 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The only evidence of marketplace success that Iron Grip proffers is that six retail competitors offered three-grip plates , and three of those competitors have entered into license agreements with respect to the '015 patent . ( Br . of Appellant at 51 ) . Iron Grip does not explain the terms of the licenses nor the circumstances under which they were granted , except to concede that two were taken in settlement of litigation . ( J.A . at 2121-22 ) . Our cases specifically require affirmative evidence of nexus where the evidence of commercial success presented is a license , because it is often `` cheaper to take licenses than to defend infringement suits . '' EWP Corp. v. Reliance Universal Inc. , 755 F.2d 898 , 908 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . Thus we held in In re GPAC Inc. , 57 F.3d 1573 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) , that licenses `` may constitute evidence of nonobviousness ; however , only little weight can be attributed to such evidence if the patentee does not demonstrate a nexus between the merits of the invention and the licenses of record . '' Id . at 1580 ( internal quotations and citations omitted ) . Without a showing of nexus , `` the mere existence of ... licenses is insufficient to overcome the conclusion of obviousness '' when there is a strong prima facie case of obviousness . SIBIA Neurosciences , Inc. v. Cadus Pharm . Corp. , 225 F.3d 1349 , 1358 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . There is no such evidence of a nexus here ; hence the existence of licenses is of little significance.4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Iron Grip places significant emphasis on the fact that , before it filed for the '015 patent , there was no three-grip plate being offered in the retail market . It argues that the absence of such a three- *1325 grip plate in light of the prior art speaks to the nonobviousness of its invention . However , Iron Grip has presented no evidence of a long-felt need for three-grip weight plates or the failure of others . Absent a showing of long-felt need or the failure of others , the mere passage of time without the claimed invention is not evidence of nonobviousness . See In re Wright , 569 F.2d 1124 , 1127 ( C.C.P.A.1977 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Iron Grip also argues that USA Sports has copied its invention and this is objective evidence of nonobviousness . Our cases do establish that copying by a competitor may be a relevant consideration in the secondary factor analysis . Vandenberg , 740 F.2d at 1567 . Not every competing product that arguably falls within the scope of a patent is evidence of copying . Otherwise every infringement suit would automatically confirm the nonobviousness of the patent . Rather , copying requires the replication of a specific product . This may be demonstrated either through internal documents , see Akamai Techs. , Inc. v. Cable & Wireless Internet Servs. , Inc. , 344 F.3d 1186 , 1196-97 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ; direct evidence such as disassembling a patented prototype , photographing its features , and using the photograph as a blueprint to build a virtually identical replica , see Advanced Display Sys. , Inc. v. Kent State Univ. , 212 F.3d 1272 , 1285 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ; or access to , and substantial similarity to , the patented product ( as opposed to the patent ) , Cable Elec . Prods. , Inc. v. Genmark , Inc. , 770 F.2d 1015 , 1027 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) , overruled on other grounds by , Midwest Indus. , Inc. v. Karavan Trailers , Inc. , 175 F.3d 1356 , 1359 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( en banc ) . The evidence of copying offered by Iron Grip is that USA Sports abandoned a one-grip plate and produced a three-grip plate after the '015 patent issued , despite receiving assurance from Iron Grip that a one-grip plate would not infringe Iron Grip 's patent . ( Br . of Appellant at 52-53 . ) This does not establish that USA Sports engaged in copying . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Since Iron Grip has not presented evidence of commercial success , satisfaction of a long-felt need , or copying , we conclude that there is no objective evidence to rebut the strong showing of obviousness based on the prior art.5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For these reasons , the district court 's grant of summary judgment as to the invalidity of claims 1-3 and 6-8 of the '015 patent is _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ No costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 392 F.3d 1317 , 73 U.S.P.Q.2d 1225 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , USA Sports has not contested the finding of infringement except on the ground of invalidity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For example , U.S. Patent 4,673,179 describes a gymnastics weight with multiple handles as `` very utilitarian '' because it `` enables a large number of grasping portions , and is very easily manipulated by the user . '' Id . col. 4 , ll . 52-54 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is no claim here that expert testimony is required , the technology being simple . See Centricut LLC v. Esab Group , Inc. , 390 F.3d 1361 , 1324-25 , slip op . at 13-14 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) . Indeed , both parties agree that the level of skill in the art is that of a layperson . ( Br . of Appellant at 43 ; Br . of Appellee at 50 . ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Whatever little significance the licenses may have is clearly outweighed by the strong evidence of obviousness found in the prior art . Ruiz , 234 F.3d at 668 ; Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Philip Morris Inc. , 229 F.3d 1120 , 1131 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Iron Grip does not argue that dependant claims 2-3 and 6-8 were improperly held to be obvious if the obviousness determination as to claim 1 is sustained . We interpret the district court 's judgment as reaching only the asserted claims ( i.e . claims 1-3 and 6-8 ) . Given our disposition it is unnecessary for us to consider the other alleged prior art submitted by USA Sports . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

( collectively , the `` Defendants '' ) appeal from the final judgments of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada in favor of Plaintiffs-Appellees Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals , Inc. and Bayer Schering Pharma AG ( collectively , `` Bayer '' ) . In particular , the Defendants challenge the district court 's entry of summary judgment that asserted claims 13 and 15 of Bayer 's U.S. Patent RE37,564 ( the `` ¡¬564 patent '' ) are not invalid for obviousness in view of numerous cited prior art references . Bayer Schering Pharma AG v. Watson Pharm. , Inc. , Nos . 2:07-cv-01472 , 2:08-cv-00995 , 2012 WL 1079551 ( D.Nev . Mar . 30 , 2012 ) ( `` Watson Summary *1371 Judgment Order `` ) ; Bayer Schering Pharma AG v. Lupin Ltd. , No . 2:10-cv-01166 , 2012 WL 1080296 ( D.Nev . Mar . 30 , 2012 ) ( `` Lupin Summary Judgment Order `` ) . For the reasons that follow , we reverse . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ This case concerns pharmaceutical formulations and dosing regimens for combined oral contraceptive ( `` COC '' ) products . First introduced in 1960 , COCs , better known as birth control pills , deliver synthetic hormones that regulate the natural ovarian cycle and prevent pregnancy . Specifically , COCs comprise a progestin and an estrogen that together inhibit folliculogenesis-a stepwise , hormone-directed process in which an ovarian follicle containing an immature oocyte ( i.e. , an egg cell ) grows and develops for approximately the first two weeks of an ovarian cycle , culminating in the release of a fertile oocyte at ovulation . The synthetic progestin and estrogen provided in a COC suppress production of the natural hormones that drive folliculogenesis , thus inhibiting ovulation and reducing the incidence of pregnancy in COC users . The contraceptive effects depend on the continued presence of the inhibitory synthetic hormones ; folliculogenesis will commence if the synthetic progestin and estrogen are withdrawn but can be abrogated if the hormones are reintroduced before ovulation occurs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To maintain synthetic hormone concentrations sufficient for sustained follicular suppression , COCs are typically taken once daily , and since their introduction , most COCs have been provided in 28-day , 28-pill packs that align with the approximate length of a natural ovarian cycle . Early COCs relied on a 21/7 dosing regimen in which each monthly pill pack would include twenty-one active pills containing synthetic progestin and estrogen followed by seven placebo pills containing no hormones . The seven-day placebo period , also known as the pill-free interval , was originally included because it ( i ) triggered a `` withdrawal bleed '' that mimicked natural menstrual bleeding and was presumed to improve acceptance among COC users , and ( ii ) provided a regular break from synthetic hormone exposure that was thought to mitigate potential side effects . The 21/7 regimen persists in most COCs on the market today . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In addition to maintaining a pill-free interval , another strategy to reduce side effects has been to reduce the hormone dose provided in each pill . For example , the first COCs provided relatively high daily doses of synthetic estrogen , up to approximately 150 £gg per active pill . Deleterious side effects of COC use , including thromboembolism , nausea , and bloating , have been most strongly associated with synthetic estrogen exposure , so the estrogen dose in particular has been progressively reduced over time . The first COC containing the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol ( `` EE '' ) at only 20 £gg per pill was approved for sale in the United States in 1976 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the early 1990s , Bayer began developing a low-dose COC containing 20 £gg EE and the synthetic progestin drospirenone ( `` DRSP '' ) to be administered with a reduced pill-free interval . Lowering EE dosage to 20 £gg per pill limits undesirable side effects , but it also results in weaker ovarian suppression compared to higher-dose COCs . As such , some ovarian activity and follicular maturation can persist in users of low-dose COCs , and any intake errors ( i.e. , missed pills ) , especially those that effectively lengthen the unregulated pill-free interval , could result in `` escape '' ovulation and unintended pregnancy . ¡¬ 564 patent col. 2 l. 38-col. 3 l. 6 . To address the risk of escape ovulation for users of low-dose COCs , Bayer implemented 23/5 and 24/4 dosing regimens , reducing the pill-free interval to five or four days , respectively , *1372 and increasing the number of active pills per cycle accordingly . Bayer demonstrated that shortening the pill-free interval to four or five days improved the contraceptive efficacy of low-dose COC formulations . Accordingly , Bayer filed its first patent application directed to such low-dose , extended-regimen COCs on December 22 , 1993 , and that application eventually led to the ¡¬564 patent.1 The ¡¬564 patent includes 15 claims reciting various COC preparations ; claims 13 and 15 read as follows : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 13 . A combination product for oral contraception , comprising _NEWLINE_ ( a ) 23 or 24 daily dosage units , each containing 0.020 mg of ethinylestradiol , and 2.5 to 3.0 mg of drospirenone , and _NEWLINE_ ( b ) 5 or 4 , respectively , active ingredient-free placebo pills or other indications to show that the daily administration of the 23 or 24 dosage units , respectively , is to be followed by 5 or 4 , respectively , pill-free or placebo pill days , _NEWLINE_ wherein each of the dosage units containing drospirenone contains the same amount of drospirenone . _NEWLINE_ ... . _NEWLINE_ 15 . A combination preparation of claim 13 , which comprises 24 dosage units and 4 placebo pills or other indications to show that no dosage unit or placebo pill is administered during the last 4 days of the menstrual cycle . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬564 patent col. 6 l. 57-col. 8 l. 4 . Bayer markets a COC product that embodies claims 13 and 15 under the brand name YAZ ( r ) . That product includes four placebo pills and twenty-four active pills each containing 20 £gg EE and 3 mg DRSP . Bayer received final approval to market YAZ ( r ) in the United States on March 16 , 2006 . _NEWLINE_ The Defendants filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications ( `` ANDAs '' ) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) seeking approval to market generic versions of YAZ ( r ) . Those ANDA filings included Paragraph IV certifications asserting that the ¡¬564 patent is invalid . See 21 U.S.C . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( IV ) ( 2006 ) . Bayer responded by bringing patent infringement actions alleging that the Defendants ' ANDA filings infringed claims 13 and 15 of the ¡¬564 patent under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) .2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Before the district court , the Defendants conceded that their ANDAs infringed the ¡¬564 patent under ¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) .

The Defendants responded and counterclaimed , however , that the asserted claims of the ¡¬564 patent were invalid for obviousness in view of numerous prior art references . Each side moved for summary judgment on the obviousness issue , and the district court granted Bayer 's motions , holding that the asserted claims of the ¡¬564 patent were not invalid *1373 in view of the cited prior art .

We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) .3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ Summary judgment is appropriate `` if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law .

Obviousness is a question of law premised on underlying issues of fact . KSR Int ' l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 427 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The sole issue before us is whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Bayer and holding that asserted claims 13 and 15 of the ¡¬564 patent are not invalid for obviousness in light of the presented prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Defendants rely on six prior art references : Australian Patent Application 55094/90 , published November 22 , 1990 ( `` AU¡¬094 '' ) ; European Patent Application Publication 0 253 607 , published April 29 , 1992 ( `` EP¡¬607 '' ) ; B.G . Molloy et al. , `` Missed Pill '' conception : fact or fiction ? , 290 Brit . Med . J . 1474 ( 1985 ) ( `` Molloy '' ) ; John Guillebaud , The forgotten pill-and the paramount importance of the pill-free week , 12 Brit . J. Fam . Plan . 35 ( 1987 ) ( `` Guillebaud '' ) ; B-M. Landgren & E. Diczfalusy , Hormonal Consequences of Missing the Pill During the First Two Days of *1374 Three Consecutive Artificial Cycles , 29 Contraception 437 ( 1984 ) ( `` Landgren '' ) ; and N.D. Goldstuck et al. , Use and misuse of oral contraceptives by adolescents attending a free-standing clinic , 3 Advances in Contraception 335 ( 1987 ) ( `` Goldstuck '' ) . According to the Defendants , the combination of AU¡¬094 with any of EP¡¬607 , Molloy , Guillebaud , Landgren , or Goldstuck would have rendered the asserted claims of the ¡¬564 patent obvious at the time of invention . In particular , the Defendants argue that AU¡¬094 discloses a COC combining 20-40 £gg EE and 1-10 mg DRSP per active pill-dosage ranges that encompass those recited in claims 13 and 15 of the ¡¬ 564 patent . The Defendants further contend that EP¡¬607 , Molloy , Guillebaud , Landgren , and Goldstuck each disclose 23/5 and/or 24/4 dosing regimens and that those references provided motivation to combine such regimens with the low-dose COCs disclosed in AU¡¬094 by identifying the problem of missed-pill conceptions and suggesting a shortened pill-free interval as a solution . Finally , the Defendants contend that the district court erred by misapplying and misinterpreting the cited references and by crediting legally insufficient evidence as secondary indicia of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response , Bayer argues that AU¡¬094 and EP¡¬607 were directed to narrow subpopulations of patients primarily in need of hormone-replacement therapy , so those references would not have been combined by a person of ordinary skill seeking to develop a COC in 1993 . Furthermore , according to Bayer , the prior art as a whole taught away from the claimed COC preparations at that time in view of the entrenched use of traditional 21/7 dosing and the perceived risks from increasing total synthetic hormone administration by shortening the pill-free interval . Finally , Bayer defends the district court 's reliance on its evidence of unexpected results , expert skepticism , industry praise , and copying as secondary indicia of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with the Defendants that the district court erred in holding the claims not invalid . A claim is invalid for obviousness `` if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) ( 2006 ) . In this case , the cited prior art references set forth every limitation required by the asserted claims and provide express motivation to combine those teachings to derive the claimed COC products . Accordingly , the asserted claims are invalid under ¡± 103 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is no dispute that claims 13 and 15 of the ¡¬564 patent require a COC product defined by the following limitations : ( 1 ) 20 £gg EE per active pill , ( 2 ) 2.5-3.0 mg DRSP per active pill , and ( 3 ) a 23/5 or 24/4 dosing regimen . ¡¬564 patent col. 6 l. 57-col. 8 l. 4 . Nor is it disputed that the cited prior art references disclose each of those limitations . For example , EP¡¬607 discloses a combination dosage form that can provide hormonal replacement therapy and contraceptive protection , using a `` preferred administration cycle [ of ] 24 days of the combination dosage form and 4 days of no dosage form . '' EP¡¬607 col. 1 ll . 3-18 ; see also id . col. 3 ll . 46-57 ( describing 24/4 and 23/5 dosage regimens as `` preferred '' ) . In addition , the disclosed active dosage form includes an estrogen and a progestin ; EP¡¬607 lists EE ( 8-30 £gg per dose ) among three estrogen choices and describes several suitable progestins , but DRSP is not disclosed . Id . col. 2 l. 35-col. 3 l. 25 . AU¡¬094 , however , discloses DRSP as an additional progestin suitable for use `` alone or in combination with estrogens in contraceptive preparations . '' AU¡¬094 at 1 . Furthermore , AU¡¬094 indicates that EE is a *1375 preferred estrogen complement to DRSP for COC use and suggests using daily doses of 20-40 £gg EE with 1-10 mg DRSP . Id . at 4-5 . AU¡¬094 even refers expressly to EP¡¬ 607 , stating that the disclosed EE/DRSP preparations can be used `` analogously '' to the EP¡¬607 combinations and expressly incorporating the disclosure of EP¡¬607 by reference . Id . at 5-6 . In sum , EP¡¬607 and AU¡¬094 disclose all three limitations required by the asserted claims . AU¡¬094 discloses COC preparations that encompass the claimed doses of EE and DRSP , and EP¡¬607 discloses similar COCs , also comprising the claimed dose of EE , administered via the claimed 24/4 and 23/5 regimens . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With every limitation of the asserted claims thus disclosed in the cited references , the question , as the district court recognized , becomes whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine those teachings to derive the claimed subject matter with a reasonable expectation of success . See , e.g. , Unigene Labs. , Inc. v. Apotex , Inc. , 655 F.3d 1352 , 1360 ( Fed.Cir.2011 ) ( `` Obviousness requires more than a mere showing that the prior art includes separate references covering each separate limitation in a claim under examination . Rather , obviousness requires the additional showing that a person of ordinary skill at the time of the invention would have selected and combined those prior art elements ... . '' ) ( citing KSR , 550 U.S. at 418 , 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ) ; see also Watson Summary Judgment Order , 2012 WL 1079551 , at *18 ( `` What was not known based on the prior art was the desirability of using the claimed drospirenone and EE doses together with the claimed monthly regimen. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The prior art before us provides that motivation . In addition to AU¡¬094 's express reference to EP¡¬607 , several of the cited references highlight evidence that the unregulated ovarian activity that occurs during a seven-day pill-free interval can achieve significant follicular development , and those references also express concern that inadvertently extending the traditional pill-free interval via one or more missed pills could lead to escape ovulation and unintended pregnancy . See , e.g. , Molloy at 1475 ( `` The demonstration of ovarian folliculogenesis ... on the seventh pill free day , means that during the early days of the subsequent pill cycle , some women harbour significantly developed follicles , ready to [ ovulate ] if oestrogen suppression were to fail because of a missed pill . `` ) ; Guillebaud at 35 ( stating `` that it is precisely because of this seven day break that most pregnancies occur , and that the pill omissions of greatest concern are those that lead to a lengthening of the pill-free interval '' ) ( quotation omitted ) ; Landgren at 444 ( `` These data seem to suggest that ovulation is more likely to occur when the pill is omitted during the first days of the artificial cycle . Hence , the prolongation of the pill-free week by two or more days is likely to increase the risk of 'escape ' ovulation. '' ) . In addition , Bayer 's expert acknowledged that one of skill in the art at the time of the invention would have expected an even greater risk of such `` missed pill '' ovulation for users of low-dose COCs ( i.e. , those containing 20 £gg EE per active pill ) . J.A.2032-35 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The evidence thus demonstrates that missed-pill ovulation was a recognized concern with traditional 21/7 COCs , particularly for those on the market by 1993 that-like the claimed COC preparations-relied on low-dose EE . As the Supreme Court has stated , `` any need or problem known in the field of endeavor at the time of invention and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed . '' KSR , 550 U.S. at 420 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 . Furthermore , the references in this case go beyond *1376 just illuminating a known problem ; they also expressly propose the claimed solution : `` To reduce the risk of missed pill conception a 28 day pack containing 23 pills and 5 blanks could be substituted for the current 21 day pack . This would still permit a withdrawal bleed without the risk of significant follicular development . '' Molloy at 1475 ; see also Goldstuck at 338 ( `` The suggestion [ for 24/4 dosing ] is of considerable merit . This would both maintain a 28-day regimen and help reduce the pill-free interval in those women who inadvertently miss a pill . `` ) ; Guillebaud at 43 ( `` [ I ] t is preferable to shorten the pill-free interval , usually to four days , in women where there is a suspicion of an increased risk of breakthrough ovulation. '' ) . Accordingly , the prior art 's direct recommendations to use 24/4 and 23/5 dosing regimens to minimize the risks of escape ovulation would have motivated one of ordinary skill in the art to implement such a shortened pill-free interval for use with known low-dose COCs , as recited in the asserted claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bayer 's arguments do not support a contrary conclusion . Bayer contends that EP¡¬607 and AU¡¬094 `` are primarily directed to older women who have reached premenopause and are in need of hormone replacement therapy , '' and that therefore a `` skilled person setting out to design an oral contraceptive using EE and DRSP would not have used the 24/4 regimen intended to achieve effective [ hormone-replacement therapy ] . '' Appellees ' Br . 39-40 . But those references plainly disclose preparations with hormone replacement and contraceptive applications , and the product claims at issue do not distinguish between target patient populations , whether by age or otherwise . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In addition , Bayer argues that the prior art taught away from the claimed COC preparations , focusing on statements in Guillebaud as indicating that the `` conventional wisdom '' in the field favored 21/7 dosing for most patients and as suggesting that a reduced pill-free interval should be used together with higher-dose COCs for patients perceived to be at risk of escape ovulation.4 Those statements , however , do not overcome the express teachings of multiple references , including Guillebaud , that a shorter pill-free interval would improve COC efficacy . Furthermore , Guillebaud may have suggested condensing the pill-free interval while concurrently increasing the hormone dose for at-risk patients , but those two measures are never described as mutually dependent , and each could be expected to reduce missed-pill ovulation risks with or without the other . `` [ A ] finding that the prior art as a whole suggests the desirability of a particular combination need not be supported by a finding that the prior art suggests that the combination claimed ... is the preferred , or most desirable , combination . '' In re Fulton , 391 F.3d 1195 , 1200 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) . Just because one of several references indicated a preference for using 24/4 or 23/5 dosing regimens in tandem with higher-dose COCs does not mean the same missed-pill rationale could not also motivate applying the shorter pill-free interval to similarly improve other COC preparations . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1377 Finally , Bayer 's evidence of secondary indicia of nonobviousness , including alleged unexpected results , expert skepticism , industry praise , and copying by others , is legally insufficient . To demonstrate unexpected results , Bayer relies on data showing that 23/5 administration results in reduced follicular activity compared to 21/7 dosing of the same COC formulation . But those data merely confirm that administering additional active pills results in additional follicular suppression , which would have been a matter of `` common sense , '' as even Bayer 's expert agreed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As evidence of expert skepticism , Bayer cites an FDA request for clinical safety data and data demonstrating efficacy benefits sufficient to justify the added synthetic hormone exposure required for the proposed 24/4 dosing regimen . That request in no way indicates that FDA experts would have been surprised to receive such data . See Dow Jones & Co. v. Ablaise Ltd. , 606 F.3d 1338 , 1352 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) ( rejecting proffered evidence of expert skepticism that `` d [ id ] not directly address whether there was actual skepticism concerning the invention '' ) . Rather , the cited request reflects attention to the FDA 's normal duties ensuring the safety and efficacy of new drugs by requiring actual data to corroborate statements in a new drug application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Next , Bayer claims that its invention `` was widely praised by experts in the COC field . '' Appellees ' Br . 61 . In making that claim , Bayer relies on journal citations that reference the findings stated in Bayer 's published efficacy studies or discuss possible non-contraceptive indications for 24/4 COC regimens . Another article describing Bayer 's 24/4 COC regimen as an `` innovative strategy '' was authored by the first-named inventor of the ¡¬564 patent . Such bare journal citations and self-referential commendation fall well short of demonstrating true industry praise . Furthermore , industry praise of what was clearly rendered obvious by published references is not a persuasive secondary consideration . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lastly , we reject Bayer 's contention that copying of its COC preparations by the Defendants and other generic manufacturers supports its validity position . Such evidence of copying in the ANDA context is not probative of nonobviousness because a showing of bioequivalence is required for FDA approval . Purdue Pharma Prods . L.P. v. Par Pharm. , Inc. , 377 Fed.Appx . 978 , 983 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ We have considered Bayer 's remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive . Accordingly , nothing Bayer has presented overcomes the plain disclosures and express motivation to combine those disclosures in the prior art . We therefore conclude that claims 13 and 15 of the ¡¬564 patent are invalid for obviousness in view of the cited references , and we reverse the judgment of the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 713 F.3d 1369 , 106 U.S.P.Q.2d 1411 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The December 1993 application was a foreign priority application filed in Germany . Bayer filed its first corresponding U.S. application in June 1994 and obtained U.S. Patent 5,824,667 ( the `` ¡¬667 patent '' ) as a continuation of that first U.S. application on October 20 , 1998 . The asserted ¡¬564 patent , issued on February 26 , 2002 , arose as a reissue of the ¡¬667 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bayer filed suit against Watson on November 5 , 2007 , and against Sandoz on August 1 , 2008 . The district court consolidated those actions on November 4 , 2008 . Bayer Schering Pharma AG v. Watson Pharm. , Inc. , Nos . 2:07-cv-01472 , 2:08-cv-00995 ( D.Nev . Nov. 4 , 2008 ) , ECF No . 43 ( Order to Consolidate Related Cases ) . Bayer initiated parallel infringement proceedings against Lupin on July 15 , 2010 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bayer has suggested that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal . Appellees ' Br . 3-4 . Specifically , Bayer contends that it has unresolved claims for damages relating to alleged at-risk launches of infringing generic products by Watson and/or Sandoz that preclude appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) . We need not address that argument , however , because our jurisdiction over this appeal does not depend on ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) . The district court granted summary judgment against the Defendants on their invalidity counterclaims and , pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 ( b ) , entered partial final judgment that the ¡¬564 patent was not invalid for obviousness . Bayer Schering Pharma AG v. Watson Pharm. , Inc. , No . 2:07-cv-01472 ( D.Nev . May 29 , 2012 ) , ECF No . 354 ( Partial Final Judgment ) . The district court did not abuse its discretion in applying Rule 54 ( b ) , and its judgment in that part of the case is final . See Sun Pharm . Indus . v. Eli Lilly & Co. , 611 F.3d 1381 , 1384 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) . We therefore have jurisdiction to review the district court 's partial final judgment under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bayer also contends that Goldstuck `` endorsed '' Guillebaud 's suggestion to use a higher-dose formulation with a 24/4 or 23/5 regimen and therefore teaches away on the same basis . Appellees ' Br . 47-48 . In citing Guillebaud , however , Goldstuck makes no mention of hormone dose : `` The suggestion that manufacturers make 28-day packages consisting of 24 active tablets and 4 bran [ placebo ] tablets is of considerable merit [ Guillebaud ] . This would both maintain a 28-day regimen and help reduce the pill-free interval in those women who inadvertently miss a pill . '' Goldstuck at 338 . Goldstuck thus offers little support for Bayer 's position . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

'' ) . We now fully explain our decision . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1557 The U.S. Surgical Inventions _NEWLINE_ The inventions claimed in the '420 patent and its continuation-in-part the '057 patent are for a surgical instrument for ligating blood vessels and other tissues during endoscopic surgery , by applying multiple ligating clips in sequence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Endoscopic surgery is a procedure whereby instead of opening the abdomen or other body cavity by incision to provide open access to the surgical site , the surgery is performed by inserting the surgical instruments into the body through small tubes called trocars . The small size of the incisions that accommodate the trocars results in less tissue damage , less pain , and faster healing than for traditional open surgery . In performing endoscopic surgery the body cavity is inflated with a gas , called an insufflating gas , to provide working space . For most procedures today a miniature video camera is used to televise the surgical site , the enlarged video image appearing upon an external screen and guiding the surgeon or surgical team in manipulating the instruments through the trocars . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Endoscopic surgery was in somewhat limited use for many years , having been used mostly for the ligation of fallopian tubes , the surgeon viewing the site through an eyepiece . Endoscopic procedures experienced rapid expansion after about 1989 , particularly for gallbladder removal . Witnesses disputed at trial whether the expansion was due to the development of the miniature video camera or the development of U.S. Surgical 's endoscopic multiple clip applier . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ During both endoscopic and open surgery , blood vessels may be closed and tissues clamped using small `` U '' shaped clamps called ligating clips . Ligating clips are applied by an instrument that positions the clip about the tissue or vessel to be secured and then compresses the clip . When initially developed , ligating clip instruments were capable of being loaded with only one clip at a time , and required reloading between each application . Then U.S. Surgical developed a ligating clip applier for open surgical use that applied multiple clips in succession , without reloading the instrument . This instrument , having the brand name `` Premium Surgiclip , '' is the subject of United States Patent No . 5,030,226 ( the '226 patent ) . The Premium Surgiclip and the '226 patent are prior art to the '420 and '057 patents in suit , and were the subject of extensive testimony at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At trial witnesses explained the subsequent development of the instrument of the patents in suit , a ligating clip applier for endoscopic use that applies multiple clips in succession without withdrawing and reloading the instrument . U.S. Surgical 's instrument , having the brand name EndoClip , was the first multiple clip applier for endoscopic use . The instrument is depicted in the '420 patent as follows : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ *1558 The instrument is depicted in the '057 patent with a different handle , as follows : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ -- -- - _NEWLINE_ It is seen that these instruments have an elongated shank that holds the ligating clips and is shaped for endoscopic use through a trocar . After insertion into the body cavity a clip is pushed into position in the jaws using controls on the handle , and the clip is applied to the tissue to be ligated by closing the jaws using controls on the handle . The jaws are then opened and the next clip is pushed into position . Thus successive clips may be applied without withdrawing the instrument from within the body . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 of the '420 patent is directed to the combination of the trocar and the clip applier , each component having defined limitations . Claim 1 is the only '420 patent claim in suit : _NEWLINE_ 1 . In combination : _NEWLINE_ a ) a trocar having a cannula , and valve means for sealing said cannula , said cannula being adapted for entry into a body cavity ; _NEWLINE_ b ) an endoscopic clip applier having : _NEWLINE_ i ) a frame ; _NEWLINE_ ii ) an endoscopic portion defining a longitudinal axis and extending distally from said frame , said endoscopic portion being insertable into said cannula through said valve means in sealing engagement therewith , said endoscopic portion further including a plurality of surgical clips disposed in an array and clip closing means for sequentially closing said surgical clips ; and _NEWLINE_ iii ) seal means associated and adapted to cooperate with at least one of said endoscopic portion and said frame to obstruct passage of gaseous media from the body cavity . _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 , the broadest claim of the '057 patent , also describes the endoscopic apparatus as comprising several elements . The claim elements are defined in terms of their function , as provided in 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 ? 6 : _NEWLINE_ 1 . An apparatus for endoscopic application of surgical clips to body tissue which comprises : _NEWLINE_ a ) frame means ; _NEWLINE_ b ) endoscopic means connected to said frame means of generally elongated configuration and extending distally from said frame means and including : _NEWLINE_ i ) means for storing a plurality of surgical clips ; _NEWLINE_ ii ) means for individually advancing said clips to the distal portion of said endoscopic means for positioning adjacent the body tissue to be clipped ; _NEWLINE_ iii ) means for at least partially closing said clip at least sufficient to grip the body tissue after the clip has been advanced distally to said distal portion of said endoscopic means ; and _NEWLINE_ iv ) gaseous sealing means . _NEWLINE_ Claim 2 of the '057 patent specifies the use of silicon grease as the gaseous sealing means of clause iv , and claim 7 is directed to a disposable device as in claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ethicon 's defense that the claims are invalid for obviousness was based on the ground that U.S. Surgical had merely adapted to endoscopic use its own , prior art multiple clip applier , the Premium Surgiclip of the '226 patent , by known and routine adaptation . *1559 Thus Ethicon presented evidence and argument that U.S. Surgical had simply elongated the body of its prior art multiple clip applier so that it could be used through a trocar , with a sealing means to prevent escape of the insufflating gas through the trocar . Ethicon adduced extensive evidence that such adaptation was well known to persons of ordinary skill in the field of endoscopic instruments . U.S. Surgical countered with evidence and argument to the contrary . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jury held , by special verdicts , that the claims in suit were invalid for obviousness . On appellate review we determine whether , on correct instructions of law , there was substantial evidence whereby a reasonable jury could have reached the verdict reached by this jury . See Litton Sys. , Inc. v. Honeywell , Inc. , 87 F.3d 1559 , 1566 , 39 USPQ2d 1321 , 1324 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` Substantial evidence describes that minimum quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief . `` ) ; Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co. , 72 F.3d 857 , 862 , 37 USPQ2d 1161 , 1163 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( `` Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence , on the record as a whole , as could be accepted by a reasonable mind as adequate to support the verdict . '' ) Conflicting evidence and argument must be viewed as resolved favorably to the party in whose favor the jury found . The reviewing court must give appropriate deference to the jury 's choices in weighing the evidence , in deciding between opposing positions , and in drawing factual inferences . Richardson v. Suzuki Motor Co. , 868 F.2d 1226 , 9 USPQ2d 1913 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) ( `` 'the appellate court 's function is exhausted when that evidentiary basis [ of the jury 's verdict ] becomes apparent , it being immaterial that the court might draw a contrary inference or feel that another conclusion is more reasonable . ' `` ) ( quoting Lavender v. Kurn , 327 U.S. 645 , 653 , 66 S.Ct . 740 , 744 , 90 L.Ed . 916 ( 1946 ) ) ; Medtronic , Inc. v. Intermedics , Inc. , 799 F.2d 734 , 742 , 230 USPQ 641 , 646 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) , cert . denied , 479 U.S. 1033 , 107 S.Ct . 882 , 93 L.Ed.2d 836 ( 1987 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Prior Art _NEWLINE_ As we have remarked , Ethicon 's position was that U.S. Surgical had simply elongated its prior art multiple ligating instrument so that it could be inserted through a trocar , and used known endoscopic sealing mechanisms to inhibit escape of the insufflating gas through the trocar . Expert witnesses testified that these modifications were well known to persons of ordinary skill in the art of endoscopic instruments . The witnesses presented several prior art patents , and exhibited many actual instruments , all having the common endoscopic characteristics of an elongated body and sealable engagement with the trocar . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court mentioned , in the opinion accompanying the denial of post-trial motions , that U.S. Surgical 's technical expert testified that there were approximately forty different prior art multiple clip appliers for conventional open surgery . He testified that at least four of them-the Premium Surgiclip of the '226 patent and the multiple clip appliers shown in the Montgomery patent , the Peters patent , and the Lachakar patent-embodied all of the elements of the '420/'057 claims except for the elongated body and sealing means . He testified that an elongated body and sealing means are characteristics of all endoscopic surgical instruments . In evidence were a variety of actual instruments for endoscopic surgery , all having these characteristics . These endoscopic instruments included graspers , scissors , dissectors , and single clip appliers . All had an elongated body and were adapted for sealing engagement with the trocar . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Also in evidence were references describing prior endoscopic devices for the application of multiple fasteners other than ligating clips . U.S. Patent No . 3,870,048 to Yoon showed an applier for multiple elastic rings for ligating fallopian tubes , stating that `` [ i ] t is possible to load suture ring clips within the applicator in end-to-end series fashion ... . This permits a number of clips to be applied during a procedure without the need of having to withdraw the applicator from the surgical field in order to load another clip into the applicator . '' U.S. Patent No . 4,226,239 to Polk also showed an instrument for endoscopic application of multiple ligating rings . The prior art also included at least one endoscopic *1560 multiple staple applier , Patent No . 4,944,443 to Oddsen . All of the endoscopic instruments for applying multiple fasteners had the common characteristics of elongation for use through a trocar , and most were sealed against escape of the gas through the trocar . Several references showed the use of silicon grease , as specified in claim 2 of the '057 patent , or valves , as specified in claim 1 of the '420 patent , to maintain the seal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The testimony of U.S. Surgical 's technical expert that the elongated body and the seal are common characteristics of endoscopic instruments was described by Ethicon as a concession of great weight . This evidence was stressed at trial , as Ethicon pressed its argument that U.S. Surgical had simply adapted its '226 patent multiple clip applier for endoscopic use , and that it was obvious to do so , pointing to many other instruments that had been adapted in the same way . U.S. Surgical points out that this same expert and several other expert witnesses testified about the difficulties of designing the '420/ '057 endoscopic multiple clip applier and the time and cost involved . We take note of the conflicting testimony and the opposing expert opinions of witnesses for these parties , and of the lengthy explorations by these witnesses of this technology and the development and characteristics of these surgical instruments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In comparing the '420/'057 instruments with the prior art instruments , Ethicon 's patent expert testified that the prior art '226 patent was the closest prior art and that the relevant elements of the structure of the '226 patent `` were adopted into the subject matter of the '057 and '420 patent applications . '' Ethicon 's technical expert pointed out to the jury all of the similarities of the structure and mechanisms between the device of the '226 patent and the '420/'057 patents . He pointed to the jaws to hold the clip , the pusher for advancing a stored clip to the jaws , the grooves in the face of the jaws to receive the clip , and the mechanism for closing the clip about the tissue to be ligated . The drawings of the jaws in the '226 patent and in the '420/'057 patents show this similarity : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ -- -- - _NEWLINE_ Witnesses testified that the operation of the '226 instrument and the '420/ ' 057 patents was essentially the same . It was explained that in both the '226 and the '420/'057 instruments the jaw blade , clip carrier , and pusher bar are all enclosed in a channel assembly from which the jaws protrude at the end . In the '226 patent the applicator is described in the Abstract as : _NEWLINE_ The surgical clip applicator has a pusher bar which positions the foremost clip from a clip carrier into a ready-to-fire position between the jaws prior to squeezing of the handles together . When the applicator is fired , the previously positioned surgical clip can be crimped about a vessel and when the jaws are released , a new clip is placed between the jaws for the next firing . A channel assembly moves over the jaws to close the jaws while the pusher bar is retracted into the clip carrier for delivering the foremost clip from the carrier upon release of the handles . _NEWLINE_ Referring to Fig . 4 of the '226 patent , it was explained at trial that the pusher bar ( 35 ) moves a clip ( 33 ) into the channels in the *1561 faces of the jaws ( 25 ) . When a clip is in the jaws and the handles are closed , the external channel ( 38 ) moves forward over the beveled portion of the jaws , which , by virtue of their beveled shape , are squeezed together by the external channel , thus closing the clip . At the same time , the pusher bar moves back to engage the next clip in line . When the handle is released the channel withdraws , the jaws open and release the clipped tissue , and the pusher bar moves forward , positioning the next clip into the jaws . The operating components are shown in the patent as follows : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ -- -- - _NEWLINE_ In the '226 patent the clip carrier is described as `` an elongated channel having a pair of side walls or rails between which the clips are slidably guided , a pusher which slides between the rails , and a spring for biasing the pusher in the forward direction . '' Col. 4 , lines 45-54 . The corresponding assembly , shown in Fig . 18 of the '420 patent , was the subject of comparative testimony : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1562 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ -- -- - _NEWLINE_ It was explained that the pusher bar ( 143 ) moves a ligating clip ( 138 ) into the channels in the faces of the jaws ( 135-b ) . When a clip is in the jaws and the handles are closed , the external channel ( 133 ) moves forward over the beveled portion of the jaws , squeezing them together and closing the clip . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To counter this evidence of similarity , U.S. Surgical witnesses testified that the '420/'057 instrument was not a routine adaptation of a prior instrument , and stressed the long development time and engineering difficulties involved in the conversion of the '226 device to endoscopic use . Ethicon challenged these arguments and their factual basis on cross-examination , and elicited testimony that the development time related primarily to unclaimed features of the handle . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There was testimony about the seal and how it was achieved . In its infringement case U.S. Surgical argued that `` valve means '' in the '420 patent included any known means for sealing the clip applier in the trocar , including valves and gaskets . U.S. Surgical argued at trial as stated in its proposed jury instruction construing this term for infringement purposes : _NEWLINE_ The structure for performing this [ valve means ] function includes all such structures contained in trocars known in the art at the time the '420 Patent Application was filed . _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical presented testimony to this effect at trial , thus providing substantial basis for the jury to find that the `` valve means '' of the '420 patent was known in the prior art . U.S. Surgical does not now dispute that the `` valve means '' of its '420 patent is found in prior art endoscopic instruments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the course of the extensive explanation and comparisons at trial of the prior art devices and the '420/'057 devices , there was no dispute concerning the content of the references or the structures that they described . There was no dispute concerning the structures described in the '420/'057 patents , or concerning the meaning of technical terms or words of art as used in the prior art or in the patents in suit . The jury was instructed that the technical terms had their plain meaning , as the district court mentioned in its opinion on the post-trial motions . U.S. Surgical did not proffer a particular `` construction '' of technical terms in order to distinguish the claimed inventions from prior art devices . Neither party departed from the plain meaning of the words that were used in the claims and in the specifications , and in the prior art . Although U.S. Surgical has raised on this appeal the issue of `` claim construction , '' as we shall discuss post , there *1563 was no argument at trial as to the meaning of technical terms or words of art insofar as they concern the determination of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There was opinion evidence on both sides of the question of obviousness . We turn to the objective factors , for as the district court instructed the jury , such evidence must be considered in the determination of obviousness : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Objective Factors _NEWLINE_ Objective factors assist in understanding how the invention was viewed in its field of endeavor , and provide an important practical guide to the decisionmaker . It was explained to the jury that the context in which the invention arose and its reception in the marketplace are indicia of unobviousness , and must be considered . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Witnesses for U.S. Surgical testified that the EndoClip , a commercial embodiment of the '420/'057 patents , had revolutionized endoscopic surgery and made endoscopic gall bladder removal possible . Its commercial success was emphasized , and it was stressed that the EndoClip was the first and for some years the only endoscopic multiple clip applier on the market . U.S. Surgical pointed out that the most relevant prior art , viz . single clip appliers for endoscopic surgery and multiple clip appliers for open surgery , had existed for more than a decade before U.S. Surgical produced the EndoClip for endoscopic surgery . U.S. Surgical presented evidence of the rapid acceptance and adoption of new endoscopic procedures , based on its new multiple clip applier . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Witnesses for Ethicon testified that the growth of endoscopic surgery was due to the miniature video camera , not the multiple clip applier . They testified that before a tiny camera was available to televise images of the abdominal cavity , whereby a team of surgeons could operate with a common view of the surgical field , endoscopic surgery was largely limited to ligation of fallopian tubes , a simple procedure performed by a surgeon peering through an eyepiece . According to Ethicon , U.S. Surgical 's EndoClip was developed for and had its only use for tubal ligation , and its later commercial growth was due to the sheer luck of being on the market when endoscopic surgery underwent its rapid expansion upon the capability of televising from inside the body . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus U.S. Surgical characterized its '420/'057 multiple clip applier as a pioneering advance in the field of endoscopic surgery , while Ethicon described the '420/'057 instrument as an obvious adaptation of a prior art multiple clip applier , whose commercial success was due to unrelated factors . These conflicting arguments were fully presented at trial . Witnesses , including surgeons , supported both sides . The jury was presented with questions of credibility and weight as well as factual disputes , as the jury decided whether the inventions of the claims in suit would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention at the time the invention was made . Although there were indeed questions of credibility and weight of evidence , the jury was not required to choose between alternative meanings of technical terms or words of art , or decide the scope of the claims , in deciding the question of obviousness . The factual findings of the scope and content of the prior art , the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention , the level of ordinary skill in the field of the invention , and the objective considerations , did not require `` construction '' of these claims as set forth in the Markman decisions of the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In reviewing the jury verdict of obviousness , we review whether the jury was correctly instructed on the law , and whether there was substantial evidence whereby a reasonable jury could have reached its verdict upon application of the correct law to the facts , Railroad Dynamics , Inc. v. A. Stucki Co. , 727 F.2d 1506 , 1512 , 220 USPQ 929 , 935-36 ( Fed.Cir . ) , cert . denied , 469 U.S. 871 , 105 S.Ct . 220 , 83 L.Ed.2d 150 ( 1984 ) , recognizing that invalidity must be proved by clear and convincing evidence . Perkin-Elmer Corp. v. Computervision Corp. , 732 F.2d 888 , 893 , 221 USPQ 669 , 673 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . Thus we turn to the law , as presented at trial and as instructed by the trial judge . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1564 The Jury Instructions _NEWLINE_ Jury instructions are reviewed for correctness , with due attention to their clarity , objectivity , and adequacy , taken as a whole . See Brooktree Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices , Inc. , 977 F.2d 1555 , 1570 , 24 USPQ2d 1401 , 1411 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) ( `` The correctness of a jury instruction ... is reviewed on appeal to determine whether , on the whole , the jury instructions were adequate to ensure that the jury fully understood the legal issues for each element of the case . `` ) ; Trademark Research Corp. v. Maxwell Online , Inc. , 995 F.2d 326 , 339 ( 2d Cir.1993 ) ( `` A trial court 's improper charge constitutes reversible error only 'when jury instructions , taken as a whole , give the jury a misleading impression or inadequate understanding of the law . ' `` ) ( quoting Carvel Corp. v. Diversified Management Group , Inc. , 930 F.2d 228 , 232 ( 2d Cir.1991 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jury was correctly instructed on the presumption of validity , and that Ethicon bore the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence . The jury was correctly instructed that in determining whether the inventions of the '420 and '057 patents were invalid based on obviousness , it was necessary to consider the scope and content of the prior art , the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention , the level of ordinary skill in the art , and the objective criteria of unobviousness . The court correctly explained the Graham factors . See Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 , 148 USPQ 459 ( 1966 ) . For example , in determining the level of ordinary skill in the art the jury was instructed to consider evidence submitted by the parties to show : _NEWLINE_ One , the educational level of active workers in the field ; _NEWLINE_ Two , the types of problems encountered in the art ; _NEWLINE_ Three , the nature of the prior art solutions to those problems ; _NEWLINE_ Four , the activities of others ; _NEWLINE_ Five , the rapidity with which innovations are made in the art ; _NEWLINE_ And six , the sophistication of the technology involved . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jury instructions included explanation of the principles to be applied in determining obviousness when the invention is a combination of prior art components . The court instructed that the prior art must show not only all of the elements of the claimed combination , but must contain some `` teaching , suggestion or incentive '' to a person of ordinary skill to combine the known elements in the way that U.S. Surgical combined them : _NEWLINE_ In order to prove obviousness , the defendants must prove , again by clear and convincing evidence , that one of ordinary skill in the art would have found in the prior art references some teaching , suggestion or incentive to combine the prior art references in the way that U.S. Surgical did in its invention . _NEWLINE_ The jury instructions stressed that the prior art , to be invalidating , must sufficiently teach or direct a person of ordinary skill how to obtain the result reached by the patentee : _NEWLINE_ Additionally , if you do find a teaching in the prior art that would motivate one of ordinary skill in the prior art to make the clip applier claimed in the '057 and '420 patents , you must also determine whether there was sufficient teaching or direction in the prior art of how to obtain or build the claimed clip applier such that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have a reasonable likelihood of success in making the invention . In other words , in order to find obviousness , you must find not only that the prior art would teach one of ordinary skill to try the combination of known elements , but also that the prior art would sufficiently teach or direct one of ordinary skill how to obtain the desired result . _NEWLINE_ The jury was instructed that in determining obviousness it was to consider the claim as a whole , and that it did not suffice if the individual elements of the invention were known in the prior art : _NEWLINE_ The reason you must consider the claim as a whole is because there is no dispute that U.S. Surgical 's invention is comprised of individual elements which were known in the prior art . The fact that U.S. Surgical 's inventions incorporate or combine elements already known in the prior art does *1565 not render its patents invalid . Patents can be granted on devices that contain a combination of various elements that are well known in the prior art . U.S. Surgical 's claim is that it invented the combination of those elements for the first time in the endoscopic multiple clip applier claimed in the patents in suit . _NEWLINE_ The instructions on the law of obviousness occupied eight pages of trial transcript . They were correct in law , thorough , and clearly stated . U.S. Surgical now argues that other instructions that it requested should also have been given , and that their omission requires a new trial . The district court explained its denial of these requests in its opinion on the post-trial motions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical had requested that the court read to the jury the sentence of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) that states : `` Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made , '' accompanied by the instruction that the jury should give no weight to Ethicon 's evidence of `` how long or short a time it took to make [ the invention ] '' and `` how obvious U.S. Surgical 's invention may have seemed to U.S. Surgical 's own inventors . '' The court denied the request . We do not discern reversible error in this denial , for the rejected instruction was encompassed in the instructions that were given , was the subject of expert testimony , and was included in the argument . The court did not commit error in denying an instruction that gave weight to one of the several aspects that were before the jury , and was reasonably viewed as cumulative in the context of the instructions that were given . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical also requested an instruction that the '226 patent was cumulative prior art and thus did not have to be cited to the patent examiner . In its pre-trial consideration of the issue of inequitable conduct the court , through a special master , had concluded that the '226 patent was cumulative in the circumstances and on the law that then applied in the examination of patents . Whatever the relevance of this point to the issue of inequitable conduct , which had been decided in favor of U.S. Surgical , the '226 patent was correctly treated as prior art in this litigation . The denial of this instruction is not grounds for a new trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical also requested the instruction that even if the jury found the absence of the secondary consideration of long-felt need , that was `` in no way suggestive of obviousness or invalidity . '' The instruction that was given on the secondary considerations was : _NEWLINE_ In making these three determinations [ the Graham factors ] you must also consider other surrounding circumstances which are called secondary considerations . These include : _NEWLINE_ One , whether the alleged invention was commercially successful ; _NEWLINE_ Two , whether the alleged invention satisfied a long-felt need in the art ; _NEWLINE_ Three , whether others were unsuccessful in making the alleged invention ; _NEWLINE_ Four , whether the alleged invention was copied by others in the art ; _NEWLINE_ Five , whether the alleged invention received praise from others in the art ; _NEWLINE_ Six , whether the alleged invention departed from other principles of the art . _NEWLINE_ In order to determine that secondary considerations such as commercial success are evidence of non-obviousness , there must be a causal connection between the patented features of the invention and the commercial success of the device . If commercial success is attributable to the patented features , then it is evidence of non-obviousness . _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical 's requested instruction concerning long-felt need related to the weight to be given to a fact whose existence , and significance , was disputed at trial . The issue of the objective factors was complex and hard-fought at trial , leaving areas of dispute , weight , and perhaps credibility . We discern no error in the court 's refusal to comment on a specific aspect , having instructed the jury on all aspects . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical also requested the instruction that prior art that teaches away from the patented invention is evidence of nonobviousness . That subject was comprehended in the above-quoted instruction that *1566 the jury should consider `` Six , whether the alleged invention departed from other principles of the art , '' an argument whose substance had been debated at trial . The refusal of this instruction , in light of the full instructions that were given , is not grounds for a new trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical also states that the district court should have given a curative instruction to counter Ethicon 's suggestion that the patents in suit improperly hindered competition . The record shows Ethicon 's persistent and improper innuendos . However , U.S. Surgical reasonably countered this aspect with evidence and argument concerning the purpose of the patent system . Review of the record leads us to conclude , as apparently did the district court , that this tactic did not prejudice the outcome . See City of New York v. Pullman , Inc. , 662 F.2d 910 , 917 ( 2d Cir.1981 ) ( `` The district court is not obliged to charge every contention made by the parties at trial , as long as the charge itself , taken as a whole , is fundamentally fair . '' ) ( citations omitted ) , cert . denied , 454 U.S. 1164 , 102 S.Ct . 1038 , 71 L.Ed.2d 320 ( 1982 ) . The denial of these instructions ( and others offered by both sides ) was not a miscarriage of justice , and does not establish reversible error or grounds for a new trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical also argued that its requested instructions construing the claims should have been given , and that the absence of `` claim construction '' by the district court required a new trial . In accordance with the Court 's remand for further consideration in light of Markman , we have again reviewed the requested instructions to determine whether any instructions that were improperly refused could reasonably have prejudiced the jury 's verdict of invalidity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In evaluating the refused instructions , we look first at the instructions on claim construction that were given . The issue was interpretation of these means-plus-function claims and their application to find if there was infringement by the Ethicon devices . The district court instructed the jury how to interpret means-plus-function claim elements , and how to apply these claim elements to the accused devices , as follows : _NEWLINE_ Now , in interpreting the means plus function claim elements , you must determine the following : _NEWLINE_ One , what function is called for by the claim element , and _NEWLINE_ Two , what structure , or means , is described in the patent specifications for performing the stated function . _NEWLINE_ A means plus function claim is only infringed if : _NEWLINE_ One , the function of the accused device is identical to the function disclosed in the claim element of the patent ; and _NEWLINE_ Two , the structure which performs that function in the accused device is the same as , or the equivalent of , the structure described in the patent specifications . _NEWLINE_ The second of these two steps requires you to determine whether the accused device includes the same structure as described in the patent or its equivalent . You may determine that a structure in the Ethicon device is equivalent if you determine that a person of ordinary skill in the art would consider the structure found in the accused device an insubstantial change from the structure disclosed in the patent specification . _NEWLINE_ This aspect did not concern , or determine , validity in this case . However , U.S. Surgical states that Markman requires the trial judge to perform the first portion of this instruction , that is , to determine the function and the structure or means that performs the function , and to give a detailed technical analysis for the infringement portion of the instruction ; and that failure to do so fatally flawed the trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For example , U.S. Surgical requested instructions for the first element of claim 1 of the '057 patent , starting with the following proposed claim construction : _NEWLINE_ Clause i ) of claim element 1b ) reads `` means for storing a plurality of surgical clips . '' This is a means-plus-function claim element . The stated function , as I interpret it , is to store a plurality of surgical clips . _NEWLINE_ We observe that this part of the proposed claim construction merely repeats the words of the claim . The requested instruction then *1567 told the jury what structure was described in the patent specification for performing this function : _NEWLINE_ The structure or means disclosed in the patent specification for performing this function is a clip track which holds an array of surgical clips and a spring to bias the clips toward the distal or far end of the instrument . _NEWLINE_ This information from the specification resolved no dispute , for there was none . Next , the requested instruction told the jury how to find infringement : the same instruction as in the general jury instruction that was actually given , quoted supra , but now drawn specifically to this claim element : _NEWLINE_ In order to find that this claim element of the '057 patent has been met , you must first find that defendants ' accused devices perform the function of storing a plurality of clips . Then you must find that the defendants ' accused devices have a clip track which holds an array of surgical clips and a spring to bias the clips toward the distal or far end of the instrument , or equivalent structure , which performs this function . _NEWLINE_ This text , again , repeated the function in the same words as in the claim , and repeated the undisputed description in the specification . The requested instruction then stated that if the accused devices perform this function , using the described means or an equivalent means , there is infringement . That is the same instruction as in the general instruction that was actually given , but made specific to this claim element . We doubt that Markman requires the trial judge to instruct as to an undisputed `` claim construction '' for every term , by simply parroting the words of the claim and then repeating the rule concerning infringement of means-plus-function claims . Markman explicitly recognized that the application of the claim to the accused device was for the jury . Indeed , Ethicon objected to this instruction as an improper attempt to direct the jury findings of infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Similar instructions were proffered for the other claim elements . Another rejected instruction started with a similar repetition of the words of the claim as `` interpreted '' by the judge , and an undisputed restatement of what these words mean : _NEWLINE_ The final clause of claim element b ) ii ) calls for `` clip closing means for sequentially closing said surgical clips . '' This is a means-plus-function claim element . The stated function of this particular means-plus-function claim element is `` sequentially closing said surgical clips . '' I interpret this to mean the closing of surgical clips one at a time and one after the other . _NEWLINE_ In the infringement trial , the issue was not the definition of `` sequentially , '' but the equivalency of the means that was described in the specification with the means that was used in the accused device , and issues concerning the clip advancing means . These aspects do not relate to obviousness , but to infringement . The additional text of this proposed instruction was objected to on its merits by Ethicon as an incorrect application of the law of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 ? 6 . However , this aspect raised no disputed issues with respect to the determination of obviousness in view of the prior art . The dispute concerning the requested instructions related not to the prior art , but to the accused Ethicon devices . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following is another claim element whose proffered `` interpretation '' was to repeat the words of the claim : _NEWLINE_ Claim element a ) calls for a trocar having a cannula with valve means for sealing the cannula . The claim element `` valve means for sealing said cannula '' is a means-plus-function claim element . The stated function , as I interpret it , is to seal the cannula . _NEWLINE_ There were infringement disputes concerning the valve means , and there was much debate at trial concerning the scope of this claim element as applied to Ethicon 's devices . U.S. Surgical requested the instruction that the `` valve means '' includes and is infringed by all prior art valves and gaskets and any other known structures for sealing the cannula : _NEWLINE_ The structure for performing this function includes all such structures contained in trocars known in the art at the time the '420 Patent Application was filed . Such trocars contain structures both to seal the cannula when no instrument is in *1568 the cannula , such as a flapper-type valve , and structures which form a seal between the instrument and the cannula when an instrument is inserted in the cannula , such as a gasket . The flapper valve may engage the gasket , as in the U.S. Surgical Surgiport Trocar , or be separate from the gasket , as in reusable instruments that were known at the time the '420 Patent Application was filed . Therefore , if you find that the Ethicon Endopath Trocar is a trocar having the same or equivalent structure to the structures I have just described , then the accused devices satisfy claim element a ) of Claim 1 of the '420 Patent . _NEWLINE_ We referred supra to this requested instruction , for it makes clear that validity of the U.S. Surgical patents was not grounded on asserted unobviousness of the valve means , and that a reasonable jury could have so found . The district court had left to the jury the issue of breadth of the valve means as it affected infringement , for Ethicon had vigorously objected to this instruction as prejudging the finding of infringement . In his post-trial opinion , the district judge expressed the view that the jury had accepted U.S. Surgical 's construction of the valve means since it found infringement of the '420 patent claim . We do not reach the issue of infringement . However , whether the valve means was construed as broadly as U.S. Surgical requested , or quite narrowly as Ethicon had argued , the variety of valve structures shown in the prior art was in accordance with the jury 's finding of obviousness in light of the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Markman decisions do not hold that the trial judge must repeat or restate every claim term in order to comply with the ruling that claim construction is for the court . Claim construction is a matter of resolution of disputed meanings and technical scope , to clarify and when necessary to explain what the patentee covered by the claims , for use in the determination of infringement . It is not an obligatory exercise in redundancy . Although claim construction may occasionally be necessary in obviousness determinations , when the meaning or scope of technical terms and words of art is unclear and in dispute and requires resolution in order to determine obviousness , in this case none of these rejected instructions was directed to , or has been shown reasonably to affect , the determination of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Grounds for a new trial have not been shown . See Santa Maria v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. , 81 F.3d 265 , 273 ( 2d Cir.1996 ) ( `` A new trial must be granted if the court determines that 'the verdict is against the weight of the evidence , that the damages are excessive , or that , for other reasons , the trial was not fair to the party moving . ' `` ) ( quoting Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Duncan , 311 U.S. 243 , 251 , 61 S.Ct . 189 , 194 , 85 L.Ed . 147 ( 1940 ) ) ; Shatterproof Glass Corp. v. Libbey-Owens Ford Co. , 758 F.2d 613 , 626 , 225 USPQ 634 , 643 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( `` If prejudicial error occurred , or if the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence , as an alternative to judgment n.o.v . a new trial may be granted , in the discretion of the trial judge . '' ) ( citing Fairmount Glass Works v. Cub Fork Coal Co. , 287 U.S. 474 , 53 S.Ct . 252 , 77 L.Ed . 439 ( 1933 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have not been shown prejudicial error in the jury instructions , or that the verdict of obviousness is against the clear weight of the evidence , or that substantial justice requires that the trial be voided . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Dictionary _NEWLINE_ During its deliberations the jury requested a dictionary and , over the objections of both parties , was provided one by the court . U.S. Surgical states this is reversible error , while Ethicon states that any error was harmless . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical proposes that the jury might have used the dictionary to look up definitions on which it had been instructed by the court or that had been explained by witnesses , such as `` presumption '' or `` obviousness . '' The jury was instructed , as the parties agreed , to consider the ordinary meaning of the language used in the claims . U.S. Surgical does not mention any terms that were used outside of their ordinary meaning . The district court pointed out in its post-trial opinion that the instruction to consider the ordinary meaning , and the general assumption that definitions in a standard dictionary are common knowledge with which the jury *1569 is charged , support the provision of the dictionary . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is generally agreed that the provision of a dictionary to a jury , although not favored , is not grounds for a new trial . See Wernsing v. General Motors Corp. , 298 Md . 406 , 470 A.2d 802 , 806 ( 1984 ) ( `` It appears to be the near universal consensus that a new trial is not awarded simply because a dictionary was before the jury . '' ) ( citing cases ) . U.S. Surgical offered no specifics as to words whose dictionary definitions may have adversely affected the verdict of obviousness . Instead , U.S. Surgical seeks a presumption of prejudice and an automatic new trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Both sides cite United States v. Weiss , 752 F.2d 777 ( 2d Cir.1985 ) , as stating the controlling law in the Second Circuit , and each side argues that Weiss supports its position . In Weiss a criminal defendant was convicted of mail fraud , perjury , and RICO violations , and the jury obtained accounting books without the judge 's knowledge or consent . Although the Second Circuit stated that `` extra-record information that comes to the attention of a juror is presumptively prejudicial , '' 752 F.2d at 782-83 , the court held that the trial judge 's determination that the information had not prejudiced the defendant was not an abuse of discretion , and sustained the conviction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical argues that the practice of permitting the jury to have a dictionary would undermine the patentee 's right to be its own lexicographer , and thus constitutes reversible error . However , U.S. Surgical does not direct us to any actual or reasonably possible prejudice , or any suggestion that the jury disregarded the court 's instructions on the law of obviousness , or the plain meaning of the terms used in the claims and the prior art . Instead , U.S. Surgical argues that it was Ethicon 's burden to establish that the jury did not misuse the dictionary , and that since that burden can not be met a new trial is required . However , the holding in Weiss was not for an automatic new trial . Weiss did not divest the trial judge of authority to decide whether the error , in that case viewed as juror misconduct , was in fact prejudicial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court did not commit prejudicial error by providing the dictionary . A new trial on this ground is not warranted . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Post-Trial Motions _NEWLINE_ Upon post-trial motions the district court , in a 34-page opinion , discussed validity and infringement . With respect to validity the court discussed the positions of the parties on the teachings of the prior art , the differences between the prior art and the patented inventions , and how the inventions as a whole would have been viewed by a person of ordinary skill in that art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court summarized the evidence that the prior art would have suggested the combination claimed in the '420 patent . The court referred to Ethicon 's position that U.S. Surgical had adapted its own multiple clip applier to endoscopic use , and the testimony that the only significant difference from the prior art multiple clip applier was the elongation of the shaft and the seal , and that these were common to all endoscopic instruments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court explained its conclusion that there was substantial evidence in support of the jury verdict of obviousness of the claims in suit . The court also explained its conclusion that the requirements of a new trial had not been met : that the verdict was not against the weight of evidence , that there was not a miscarriage of justice or prejudicial error during trial , or a seriously erroneous result . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Motion Upon Remand _NEWLINE_ Following the remand from the Supreme Court to the Federal Circuit , U.S. Surgical moved this court to vacate the district court 's judgment and order a new trial , on the ground that since the district court had not construed the claims as required by Markman , either before or after the jury rendered its verdicts , there is nothing for the Federal Circuit to review on appeal . U.S. Surgical states that it is entitled to a new trial of all issues of validity and infringement except for the verdicts in its favor ( infringement of the '420 patent and that there was not inequitable conduct ) for which Ethicon did not petition for certiorari . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1570 Ethicon , opposing the motion , points out that the district court , in its opinion on the post-trial motions , discussed the claim construction that the jury necessarily adopted on the two aspects of claim scope that were in genuine dispute as applied to the Ethicon devices . Ethicon points out that the district court stated that it agreed with the jury 's necessary constructions with respect to the valve means and the clip advancing means , and that the court explained its reasons for sustaining the verdicts based on those constructions . Ethicon points out that under Markman this court undertakes to perform any necessary claim construction de novo . Ethicon also points out that no disputed claim construction was material to the determination of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Concerning U.S. Surgical 's proposed instructions on claim construction , as we have discussed , whatever their applicability to the issues of infringement , their omission did not prejudice the issue of obviousness . Markman did not hold that the trial judge must always parse the claims for the jury , whether or not there is an issue in material dispute as to the meaning or scope of the claims . Neither this court nor the Supreme Court held that the trial judge must conduct such a rote exercise , on pain of having to retry the case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Ethicon had objected to the substance of U.S. Surgical 's proposed instructions , as well as asserting that they were unnecessary . We need not resolve this issue , for U.S. Surgical has not shown that there are unclear or ambiguous technical terms or words of art or related aspects of claim scope whose `` construction '' as requested by U.S. Surgical would negate the verdicts of obviousness . The jury was instructed , without objection , that the language of the claims was to have its plain meaning . There was no dispute as to the meaning of technical terms or words of art as used in either the prior art or the claims . The difference between the prior art and the claimed invention is a question of fact , Graham , 383 U.S. at 17 , 86 S.Ct . at 693-94 , 15 L.Ed.2d at 556 , 148 USPQ at 467 , and was not overruled by the Court 's Markman decision . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical argues that if the district court had construed the claims for the jury , the jury could not have reasonably accepted Ethicon 's argument that U.S. Surgical had simply made known endoscopic adjustments in its prior art multiple clip applier . This went to the ultimate question of obviousness , which was decided by the jury upon finding and weighing and evaluating the factual evidence of the Graham factors . U.S. Surgical does not explain how any reasonable claim construction that it requested would have deprived the verdict of obviousness of its support . Further , Markman does not authorize the trial judge to remove from the jury the factual findings required by Graham . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On careful consideration of the substance of the instructions on claim construction that the district court declined to give , and the instructions on the issue of obviousness , all in light of the particular issues in this case concerning the prior art , the claimed invention , and the Court 's discussion in Markman , we conclude that the omission of the requested instructions did not prejudice the determination of obviousness . The criteria for grant of a new trial have not been met . See Santa Maria , 81 F.3d at 273 ; Shatterproof Glass , 758 F.2d at 626 , 225 USPQ at 643 ( new trial appropriate when there was prejudicial error , or when verdict against weight of the evidence ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Conclusion _NEWLINE_ On review of the proceedings at trial , we conclude that there was substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could have held that the claimed subject matter would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in this field at the time the invention was made . The judgment of invalidity is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The case was vigorously litigated , with extensive testimony , physical exhibits , and argument . We have been directed to no unfairness or incompleteness or prejudice in the jury instructions with respect to obviousness . A new trial was properly denied . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Costs _NEWLINE_ Costs to Ethicon . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED ; MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL DENIED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 103 F.3d 1554 , 65 USLW 2487 , 41 U.S.P.Q.2d 1225 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ U.S. Surgical Corp. v.

( collectively `` Liebel '' ) appeal from the decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio granting Medrad 's motion for summary judgment that four of Liebel 's patents are invalid under 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 112 and 102 . Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad , Inc. , No . 01-CV-98-858 , 2005 WL 2840744 ( S.D.Ohio Oct. 28 , 2005 ) . Medrad cross-appeals from the decision of the district court granting Liebel 's motion for summary judgment that Medrad infringed the asserted patents and that the inventorship designation on Liebel 's patents is correct . Medrad also cross-appeals from the holding that the inequitable conduct counterclaim was moot in light of the district court 's invalidity rulings . Because we conclude that Liebel 's patents are invalid , the front-loading patents for lack of enablement and the syringe-sensing patents on anticipation , we affirm the district court 's judgment of invalidity . As a result , the cross-appeals on infringement and inventorship need not be reached . We also affirm the court 's decision that the inequitable conduct counterclaim is presently moot . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ This is the second time this case has been on appeal in our court . The detailed facts of the case are presented in our previous opinion , and we present here only those facts relevant to this appeal . See Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad , Inc. , 358 F.3d 898 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( `` Liebel I '' ) . This appeal concerns asserted claims of four of Liebel 's patents : claims 10 , 11 , 13 , and 16-19 of U.S. Patent 5,456,669 ; claims 1 , 8 , 9 , 11-13 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 22 , 27 , 28 , 30-33 , and 34-37 of U.S. Patent 5,658,261 ; claims 7 , 8 , 10 , and 11 of U.S. Patent 5,662,612 ; and claims 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 , 22 , and 23 of U.S. Patent 5,928,197 . The ¡¬669 and ¡¬261 patents ( hereinafter the `` front-loading patents '' ) share a common specification and are directed to a front-loading fluid injector with a replaceable syringe capable of withstanding high pressures for delivering a contrast agent to a patient . The ¡¬612 and ¡¬197 patents ( hereinafter the `` syringe-sensing patents '' ) also share a common specification and are directed to a computer-controlled injector wherein a motor advances and retracts a plunger located within the syringe . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With regard to the asserted claims of the front-loading patents , this appeal challenges the district court 's holding of invalidity following our prior claim construction regarding a pressure jacket . Claim 10 of the ¡¬669 patent is representative of the asserted claims of the front-loading patents and reads as follows : _NEWLINE_ A method of loading a tubular replacement syringe into a high pressure power injector for injecting fluid into an animal , the method comprising the steps of : _NEWLINE_ providing a power injector having : _NEWLINE_ a syringe receiving opening with a generally circular periphery therein adapted to receive a rearward end of a syringe having a generally circular rim , _NEWLINE_ a ram and a motor linked to the ram and operable to reciprocate the ram *1374 along a segment of a line projecting through the opening ; and providing a hollow tubular syringe that includes : _NEWLINE_ a cylindrical body having an axis , a generally circular rim , a rearward end and a closed forward end with a fluid discharge orifice therein , and _NEWLINE_ a plunger axially slidable in the body , the syringe body being structurally capable of withstanding , at least from the rim to the orifice , fluid at an operating pressure of at least 100 psi within the interior thereof ; _NEWLINE_ then : _NEWLINE_ inserting into the opening , by generally rearward axial movement of the syringe , the rearward end of the body ; _NEWLINE_ rotating the syringe in the opening a fraction of a turn to thereby lock the body around the rim to the injector around the periphery of the opening ; and _NEWLINE_ engaging the plunger with the ram ; _NEWLINE_ then : _NEWLINE_ energizing the motor and thereby driving the ram forward along the line and parallel to the axis to move the plunger axially forward at a programmed speed to inject the fluid at the operating pressure from within the syringe and through the orifice at a programmed rate into the animal . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬669 patent , col. 15 ll . 17-50 . The claims in the originally-filed application1 explicitly recited a pressure jacket in front of the syringe receiving opening . During the prosecution of the front-loading patents , Liebel removed all references in the claims to a pressure jacket . Medrad asserted , and the district court agreed , that during the prosecution of the front-loading patents , the applicants became aware of Medrad 's jacketless injector system and then deleted all references to a pressure jacket in the asserted claims in order to encompass Medrad 's injector within the scope of the claims . The examiner allowed the claims , and the claims as issued do not contain an explicit recitation of a pressure jacket . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Even though the claims do not expressly recite a pressure jacket , the district court initially construed the asserted claims of the front-loading patents as requiring a pressure jacket . Based on that construction , the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of Medrad because Medrad 's accused devices do not contain a pressure jacket . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the first appeal to this court , we reversed the district court 's claim construction and determined that the asserted claims of the front-loading patents do not require a pressure jacket . We first considered the language of the claims and observed that neither claim 10 of the ¡¬669 patent nor any of the other asserted claims expressly mentions a pressure jacket . We further rejected the district court 's conclusion that the term `` opening '' in independent claim 10 of the ¡¬669 patent must be limited to an opening in a pressure jacket . We then considered the specification and determined that , although all the described embodiments include a pressure jacket , *1375 the disclosure did not clearly disavow embodiments lacking a pressure jacket . We also observed that the prosecution history indicates that the asserted claims purposefully did not include a pressure jacket limitation in order to cover devices that lacked a pressure jacket . In light of the intrinsic evidence , we declined to limit the claims to require a pressure jacket . Although Medrad argued that we should construe the claims narrowly to preserve their validity , we declined to do so , stating that the question of validity was a separate issue that could be addressed on remand . Liebel I , 383 F.3d at 912 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On remand and in light of our claim construction , the district court concluded that Medrad 's devices did infringe the asserted claims of the front-loading patents , but that those claims were invalid for lack of compliance with the written description and enablement requirements of the statute . The district court reasoned that the claims were invalid for lack of written description because the specification does not describe a jacketless injector . The court noted that the written description of the invention is directed to the improvement of `` loading and unloading a syringe given the constraints presented by the pressure jacket . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also concluded that the asserted claims were invalid for lack of enablement after considering the specification and the factors set forth in In re Wands , 858 F.2d 731 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . The court observed that a pressure jacket was necessary to `` maintain the integrity of the syringe housing against pressures the syringe encounters during operation of the injector . '' The court further noted that the inventors themselves testified as to the importance of the pressure jacket around the syringe and that the experiments with and testing of jacketless systems were unsuccessful . The court also relied on testimony of Liebel 's engineers that a jacketless system was not a mere design option and that one skilled in the art would not know how to make a jacketless system . The court further found that no prototypes of a jacketless injector had been made or described at the time of filing , and that the state of the art was such that a jacketless system with a disposable syringe would have been a `` true innovation . '' Thus , the court concluded that Medrad had proffered clear and convincing evidence that the specification does not satisfy the written description and enablement requirements . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to the syringe-sensing patents , this appeal challenges the holding of invalidity following our construction of the term `` physical indicia '' and its relationship to the properties of the syringe . Claim 7 of the ¡¬612 patent is representative of the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents and reads as follows : _NEWLINE_ An injector of the type having a motor which advances and retracts a plunger located within a syringe toward and away from a nozzle located at a distal end of the syringe to inject fluid into or out of an animal subject , adapted for use with syringe assemblies which have differing capacities , comprising : _NEWLINE_ a detector located proximate to a syringe installed on said injector for detecting a physical indicia [ sic ] on said syringe related to the capacity of said syringe , and generating an electrical signal representative of said physical indicia , and _NEWLINE_ a control circuit which causes said motor to move and tracks the location of said motor while moving said motor , wherein said control circuit *1376 computes the location of a plunger within said syringe relative to an end of said syringe , by relating said electrical signal to the tracked location of said motor . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬612 patent , col. 18 ll . 36-52 ( emphases added ) . The remaining asserted claims of the ¡¬197 and ¡¬612 patents differ from representative claim 7 of the ¡¬612 patent in that some are directed to a method of controlling an injector ( claims 4 , 5 , 10 , 11 , 16 , 17 , 22 , and 23 of the ¡¬197 patent and claim 10 of the ¡¬612 patent ) , and some are dependent claims that recite the additional limitation of ceasing motion of the motor and plunger when the plunger or ram connected to the plunger has reached the end of the syringe ( claims 2 , 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 17 , 20 , and 23 of the ¡¬197 patent and claims 8 and 11 of the ¡¬612 patent ) . In addition , the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents recite physical indicia related to properties of the syringe other than the `` capacity of said syringe '' as recited in representative claim 7 of the ¡¬612 patent . Such properties include the distance of the plunger or ram coupled to the plunger from an end of the syringe ( claims 1 , 4 , 13 , and 16 of the ¡¬197 patent ) , the range of travel of an injector ram coupled to the plunger ( claims 19 and 22 of the ¡¬197 patent ) , and the amount of fluid in the syringe ( claims 7 and 10 of the ¡¬197 patent ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In its claim construction prior to our decision in Liebel I , the district court had considered the meaning of the term `` physical indicia . '' It disagreed with Medrad that the term should be limited to indicia representing the length of the extender . The court determined that the claim language was broader than Medrad 's proposed construction because the claims recited syringe properties other than the length of the extender . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , in Liebel I , Medrad had argued that we should construe the term `` physical indicia '' to be limited to features that indicate the length of the extender . Liebel I , 358 F.3d at 912 . After considering the language of the claims , the specification , and the prosecution history , we determined that the district court correctly concluded that the term `` physical indicia '' is not limited to indicia related to the length of an extender . Id . at 914 . We again stated that we would not construe the claims narrowly because of invalidity concerns , and that the issue of invalidity could be addressed on remand . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On remand and in light of our construction , the district court determined that Medrad 's accused device did infringe the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents , but that those claims were invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of ¡± 112 and because of anticipation by Medrad 's U.S. Patent 5,383,858 . With regard to written description , the district court stated that there was `` nothing in the written description that describes an invention for detecting indicia ( e.g. , ' a tangible mark ' ) on the syringe-other than the limited , alternative reference to physical indicia relating to the length of the extender . '' The district court noted that the preferred embodiment `` teaches that it is the injector 's face plate , which is removable and interchangeable , that is 'detected ' by a sensor , which in turn tells the circuit board the size of the syringe installed . '' The court also observed that the written description and enablement requirements often rise and fall together and determined that the asserted claims of the front-loading patents `` are of a far greater scope than [ Liebel 's ] specification of what it invented or possessed when it filed its application . '' The court concluded that the specification failed to fulfill both the written *1377 description and enablement requirements set forth in ¡± 112 , ? 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With regard to anticipation , the court found that even if it had concluded that Liebel 's patents were not invalid under ¡± 112 , the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents were anticipated by the prior art ¡¬858 patent . The court found that the ¡¬858 patent clearly describes an indicator mechanism for injecting fluid from a syringe into a patient , and that mechanism includes an injector controller and a sensor . The court further determined that the ¡¬858 patent discloses `` physical indicia '' by describing the use of a bar code or another readable device on the syringe that stores information about the syringe and that can be read by a sensor . The court determined that the only difference between the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents and the invention disclosed in the ¡¬858 patent was the description of the types of indicia detected . For example , the ¡¬858 patent describes that the bar code on the syringe can include information relating to the `` dimensions '' of the syringe , whereas the asserted claims recite the `` capacity '' of the syringe . The court found that these were `` semantic differences '' that did not affect its conclusion of anticipation . Hence , the court concluded that the ¡¬858 patent anticipates the syringe-sensing patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In a separate order , the district court considered whether the inventorship designated on the patents was correct , and granted Liebel 's motion for partial summary judgment that it was correct . The court determined that the alleged omitted inventor , Kelly , did not contribute to the conception of the design and thus was not properly a co-inventor . The court found that the evidence established that Kelly only attended `` brain-storming '' sessions , but that there was no clear and convincing evidence of his being an inventor . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court further determined , after resolving the invalidity motions , that Medrad 's inequitable conduct claim was moot in light of its invalidity rulings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Liebel timely appealed , and Medrad cross-appealed . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ We review the district court 's grant of summary judgment de novo , reapplying the standard applicable at the district court . See Rodime PLC v. Seagate Tech. , Inc. , 174 F.3d 1294 , 1301 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . Summary judgment is appropriate `` if the pleadings , depositions , answers to interrogatories , and admission on file , together with the affidavits , if any , show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law . '' Fed.R.Civ.P . 56 ( c ) .

Sollac & Ugine , 344 F.3d 1234 , 1238-39 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1378 A . The Front-Loading ¡¬669 and ¡¬261 Patents _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Liebel argues that the court erred in determining that the asserted claims of the front-loading patents are invalid for lack of written description and enablement . With regard to enablement , Liebel contends that the court erroneously considered whether an injector without a pressure jacket was enabled , rather than limiting its inquiry to whether an injector with a pressure jacket was enabled , as it clearly was . Liebel points out that the asserted claims do not recite or require the absence of a pressure jacket and the court improperly focused on such an embodiment . Because it is undisputed that Liebel provided an enabling disclosure of what it calls its preferred embodiment , viz. , an injector with a pressure jacket , Liebel asserts that the court should have held that the disclosure was enabling for the full scope of the claims . Liebel further asserts that the court erred in concluding , after considering the Wands factors , that undue experimentation would be required to practice the claimed invention without a pressure jacket . According to Liebel , the testimony that the court relied upon only showed that additional work , not undue experimentation , was required to develop an injector without a pressure jacket . Liebel also ascribes error to the court 's consideration of various other pieces of testimony as support for its determination that producing the invention without a pressure jacket would require undue experimentation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Medrad responds that the district court correctly determined that , under our claim construction , the asserted claims are invalid for lack of enablement . Medrad argues that the court was correct in determining that the full scope of the invention , including the injector without a pressure jacket , is not enabled . According to Medrad , although every embodiment of a claim does not need to be disclosed in the specification , the disclosure must teach the full range of embodiments in order for the claims to be enabled , and here the disclosure does not teach an injector without a pressure jacket . According to Medrad , consideration of the Wands factors also supports a determination that the asserted claims are not enabled . Medrad observes that Liebel 's own inventors admitted that they could not produce a successful pressure-jacketless system and that that was compelling evidence of lack of enablement . Medrad also cites other testimony that supports a finding of undue experimentation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with Medrad that the district court correctly determined that the asserted claims of the front-loading patents are invalid for lack of enablement . The enablement requirement is set forth in 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 , ? 1 and provides in pertinent part that the specification shall describe `` the manner and process of making and using [ the invention ] , in such full , clear , concise , and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains , or with which it is most nearly connected , to make and use the [ invention ] . '' We have stated that the `` enablement requirement is satisfied when one skilled in the art , after reading the specification , could practice the claimed invention without undue experimentation . '' AK Steel , 344 F.3d at 1244 ; see also Wands , 858 F.2d at 736-37 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have previously construed the claims of the front-loading patents such that they are not limited to an injector with a pressure jacket , and therefore the full scope of the claimed inventions includes injectors *1379 with and without a pressure jacket . That full scope must be enabled , and the district court was correct that it was not enabled . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Turning first to consideration of the specification , we find that nowhere does the specification describe an injector with a disposable syringe without a pressure jacket . In fact , the specification teaches away from such an invention . In the `` Background of the Invention , '' the specification describes general injectors and explains that during the injection phase , a plunger is driven forward and pressure develops in the syringe , ranging from 25 psi to over 1000 psi . Without a pressure jacket , syringes that are able to withstand such high pressures are `` expensive and therefore impractical where the syringes are to be disposable . Accordingly , many such injectors ... have been provided with pressure jackets fixed to the injector units and into which the syringes are inserted . '' ¡¬669 patent , col. 1 ll . 23-31 . The specification thus teaches away from a disposable syringe without a pressure jacket by stating that such syringes are `` impractical . '' As we have held previously , where the specification teaches against a purported aspect of an invention , such a teaching `` is itself evidence that at least a significant amount of experimentation would have been necessary to practice the claimed invention . '' AK Steel , 344 F.3d at 1244 . Moreover , consideration of the remainder of the specification reveals that there is no guidance or suggestion of how to make or use a disposable syringe for high pressure use without a pressure jacket . All the figures in the patents depict a pressure jacket and all discussion of them refers to the pressure jacket . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , consideration of the testimonial evidence presented supports a conclusion that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether undue experimentation would have been required to make and use the injector without a pressure jacket . The inventors admitted that they tried unsuccessfully to produce a pressure-jacketless system and that producing such a system would have required more experimentation and testing . The inventors decided not to pursue such a system because it was `` too risky . '' The district court relied on various statements in the record by the inventors that testing of a syringe without a pressure jacket proved unsuccessful and that the inventors were not aware of any other similar testing being conducted at that time . Moreover , there was no indication of any prototype of a pressure-jacketless injector having been made . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Liebel argues that language in Spectra-Physics , Inc. v. Coherent , Inc. , 827 F.2d 1524 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) , that states that if an invention pertains to an art where the results are predictable , e.g. , in the mechanical arts , then disclosure of a single embodiment can enable a broad claim , supports its position . Liebel asserts that because the specification enables one mode of making and using the invention in its preferred embodiment , viz. , an injector with a pressure jacket , the enablement requirement is satisfied and the inquiry should end there . See Engel Indus. , Inc. v. Lockformer Co. , 946 F.2d 1528 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Liebel 's reliance on Spectra-Physics is misplaced . In that case , the specification disclosed different `` attachment means '' for making the claimed invention such as moly-manganese brazing and pulse-soldering , but failed to disclose the best attachment means known to the inventors . We held that the asserted claims of the patent were invalid for failure to comply with the best mode requirement of ¡± 112 , even *1380 though the specification enabled the practice of the claims . We did note that the specifications of other patents identified TiCuSil brazing as a suitable alternative attachment technique and thus that the asserted patent 's failure to mention TiCuSil brazing as an attachment means was `` not fatal to enablement under ¡± 112 . '' Spectra-Physics , 827 F.2d at 1533 . Indeed , in that case , disclosure of one attachment means permitted one skilled in the art to make and use the invention as broadly as it was claimed , which included other attachment means known to one of ordinary skill in the art . In contrast , in this case , disclosure of an injector system with a pressure jacket does not permit one skilled in the art to make and use the invention as broadly as it was claimed , including without a pressure jacket . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The facts of this case are , in fact , more analogous to AK Steel than to Spectra-Physics . In AK Steel , the patentee argued , as it does here , that the patent disclosed several embodiments within the properly construed claim , and that the specification need not teach the full claimed scope in order for the claims to be enabled . 344 F.3d at 1243 . The claims in AK Steel read on steel strips containing either a Type 1 or a Type 2 aluminum coating . The specification clearly described only Type 2 aluminum coating . We stated , however , that `` as part of the quid pro quo of the patent bargain , the applicant 's specification must enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the full scope of the claimed invention . '' Id . at 1244 ( latter emphasis added ) . We explained that the specification need not necessarily describe how to make and use every embodiment of the invention `` because the artisan 's knowledge of the prior art and routine experimentation can often fill in the gaps . '' Id . However , because the full scope of the claims included both Type 1 and Type 2 aluminum coating , the relevant inquiry became whether one skilled in the art would have been able to make and use a steel strip containing a Type 1 aluminum coating at the time of the patent 's effective filing date . Id . We held that the specification taught against using a Type 1 aluminum coating , and therefore that the claims were invalid for lack of enablement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Similarly , in this case , the asserted claims read on , and the full scope of the claimed invention includes , an injector system with and without a pressure jacket . There must be `` reasonable enablement of the scope of the range '' which , in this case , includes both injector systems with and without a pressure jacket . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The specification 's reference that teaches away from an injector system with a disposable syringe without a pressure jacket , combined with the testimonial evidence that such a system could not have been produced at the time of filing , supports the district court 's conclusion that the specification fails to fulfill the enablement requirement of ¡± 112 . Because we are resolving this issue on the enablement ground , we do not need to consider the written description holding of invalidity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The irony of this situation is that Liebel successfully pressed to have its claims include a jacketless system , but , having won that battle , it then had to show that such a claim was fully enabled , a challenge it could not meet . The motto , `` beware of what one asks for , '' might be applicable here . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . The Syringe-Sensing ¡¬612 and ¡¬197 Patents _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Liebel argues that Medrad failed to provide clear and convincing *1381 evidence that the ¡¬858 patent anticipates the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents . In particular , Liebel asserts that the ¡¬858 patent does not disclose a control circuit that computes the location of the plunger within the syringe , stops the motor and plunger , or determines that the plunger is at the end of the syringe , as required by the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Medrad responds that the district court correctly decided that the ¡¬858 patent anticipates the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents . Medrad asserts that the ¡¬858 patent expressly discloses an injector control that controls a motor and plunger by computing the location of the plunger . Medrad also asserts that the district court held that measuring actual plunger movement is accomplished by `` long-established potentiometer technology , '' and that the ¡¬858 patent incorporates two patents that discuss measuring plunger movement . Medrad finally contends that the ¡¬858 patent discloses detecting the same physical indicia as the syringe-sensing patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with Medrad that the district court correctly determined that there is no genuine issue of material fact that the ¡¬858 patent anticipates2 the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents . A determination that a patent is invalid as anticipated under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 requires that a prior art reference disclose every limitation of the claimed invention , either explicitly or inherently . Telemac Cellular Corp. v. Topp Telecom , Inc. , 247 F.3d 1316 , 1327 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . The prior art reference in this case is Medrad 's ¡¬858 patent , which was cited to the PTO during the prosecution of the syringe-sensing patents . Although the burden of showing invalidity is `` especially difficult '' when the prior art reference was before the examiner during prosecution , we find that Medrad has met that burden here . See Glaxo Group Ltd. v. Apotex , Inc. , 376 F.3d 1339 , 1348 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Liebel first argues that the ¡¬858 patent fails to disclose the closed control circuit that computes the location of a plunger , as required by claim 7 of the ¡¬612 patent . We disagree . There is no genuine issue of material fact as to what the ¡¬858 patent discloses . The ¡¬858 patent discloses a syringe that is rotatably mountable on a front wall of an injector housing with an interference fit . Although that patent expressly mentions an injector controller , it does not discuss the details of how the controller interacts with the motor and plunger . However , the ¡¬858 patent incorporates by reference3 U.S. Patent 4,006,736 , assigned to Medrad , which clearly does discuss the details of the control circuit and its interaction with the plunger . The ¡¬736 patent discloses a system for injecting fluid into a patient and it is replete with discussion of the control unit of that system operating the motor and tracking the plunger movement . For example , *1382 the patent expressly states that `` as the motor drives the plunger , the potentiometer tracks it , so that the rate of movement and position may be derived . '' ¡¬736 patent , col. 20 ll . 21-24 ( reference characters omitted ) . The ¡¬736 patent further states that `` the volume circuit monitors the position of plunger after an injection begins to determine how much volume of contrast media has been delivered . And when the plunger has delivered the set volume , the volume circuit sends a signal to the time circuit to stop injecting . '' ¡¬736 patent , col. 19 ll . 32-37 ( reference characters omitted ) . The ¡¬858 patent , which incorporates by reference the ¡¬736 patent , therefore discloses a claimed control circuit that computes the location of a plunger . In addition , the limitation recited in some of the dependent claims of the syringe-sensing patents-using the control circuit to stop movement of the motor and plunger when the plunger is at the end of the syringe-is similarly disclosed in the ¡¬736 patent in the discussion pertaining to moving and retracting the plunger . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Liebel next asserts that the ¡¬858 patent fails to disclose physical indicia related to various parameters or properties of the syringe . We disagree again . In our claim construction , we determined that the term `` physical indicia , '' as Liebel has argued , is not limited to indicia related to the length of the extender . Thus , the full scope of the claims includes the detection of physical indicia other than detection of the length of the extender . Those physical indicia recited in the claims are : the capacity of the syringe , the distance of the plunger from an end of the syringe , the amount of fluid in the syringe , and the end of the travel position of an injector ram coupled to the plunger . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬858 patent discloses using an encoding device , such as a bar code , located on the syringe , and a sensor , located on the injector , for reading the encoded device and forwarding signals to the injector controller to modify the injector apparatus accordingly . ¡¬858 patent , col. 6 ll . 31-45 . The ¡¬858 patent also states that as an alternative to the encoding device being a bar code with spaced bars , the encoding device can include raised surfaces corresponding to the spaced bars that would be read by an injector sensor , or can include mechanically readable devices such as a slot , hold , or projection on the syringe or plunger that would send information concerning the type of syringe used to the circuits of the injector . ¡¬858 patent , col. 6 ll . 51-65 . The ¡¬858 patent provides the following examples of the information that can be included in the encoding device : `` dimensions of the syringe , content of the syringe in the case of a pre-filled syringe , manufacturing information such as lot numbers , dates and tool cavity number , recommended contrast media flow rates and pressures , and loading/injection sequences . '' ¡¬858 patent col. 6 ll . 45-51 . Thus , the ¡¬858 patent clearly discloses the detection of various parameters of the syringe through the use of a bar code or other marks on the syringe . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Liebel asserts that `` dimensions of the syringe '' are not the same as `` capacity of the syringe , '' as recited in the asserted claims . As the district court observed , detecting dimensions of the syringe permits calculation of capacity using a basic volumetric formula . Moreover , the ¡¬858 patent expressly lists as an example of the type of information that can be included in the bar code the `` content of the syringe , '' which can encompass the capacity of the syringe as well as the amount of fluid in the syringe . The ¡¬858 patent also states that the encoding device can include the `` loading/injection sequences , '' which can *1383 encompass information related to the initial position of the plunger . Moreover , although the ¡¬858 patent only provides a few examples of the types of information that can be stored in the encoding device , the list is not exclusive and may include other information logically related to the `` dimensions '' of the syringe or the `` content '' of the syringe , such as the initial plunger position . Thus , there is no genuine issue of material fact that the ¡¬858 patent , including the disclosure of the ¡¬736 patent that is incorporated by reference , clearly discloses the limitations of the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents . The district court therefore did not err in concluding that the syringe-sensing patents are invalid for anticipation as a matter of law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Liebel argued for a broad construction of the term `` physical indicia '' and in fact broadened its claims during prosecution to recite physical indicia other than those indicating the length of an extender . Once again , Liebel argued for a broad meaning , and succeeded , but suffers a Pyrrhic victory . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. Cross-Appeals _NEWLINE_ Because we affirm the district court 's conclusion that the asserted claims of the patents at issue are invalid , we need not reach Medrad 's cross-appealed issues concerning infringement and inventorship , the latter actually being an alternative ground for a holding of invalidity , not a proper basis for a cross-appeal.4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D. Inequitable Conduct _NEWLINE_ Medrad finally argues that the district court should not have dismissed as moot its counterclaim asserting inequitable conduct . Medrad asserts that that counterclaim is independent and distinct from an invalidity claim , and it may be the basis for two additional remedies : a determination that the entire patent is unenforceable and an award of attorney fees under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with the district court that the inequitable conduct counterclaim is moot . With regard to the argument that an inequitable conduct determination may render the entire patent unenforceable , Medrad admitted during oral arguments that such relief is not meaningful to Medrad at this time . The only other additional relief that may be available to Medrad by an inequitable conduct determination is attorney fees under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 285 . Medrad admitted during oral arguments that , although it plans to predicate an attorney fee application on inequitable conduct , it has not filed that application yet . We therefore affirm the decision that the inequitable conduct counterclaim is presently moot . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ Because the district court correctly granted summary judgment that Liebel 's patents are invalid , we affirm the conclusion that all the asserted claims are invalid , the front-loading patents on enablement and the syringe-sensing patents on anticipation grounds . Because we find no error in the district court 's holding that the inequitable conduct counterclaim is moot , we affirm that decision as well . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 481 F.3d 1371 , 82 U.S.P.Q.2d 1113 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 1991 , Liebel filed Application Serial No . 07/712,110 , which issued as U.S. Patent 5,300,031 . The claims of the ¡¬031 patent include a pressure jacket limitation . The ¡¬669 and ¡¬261 patents , which do not recite a pressure jacket limitation , resulted from continuation applications , claiming priority from the ¡¬110 application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because we determine that the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents are invalid by reason of anticipation by the ¡¬858 patent , we need not address written description or enablement issues , which were the other grounds on which the district court found the syringe-sensing patents to be invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have stated that `` material not explicitly contained in the single , prior art document may still be considered for purposes of anticipation if that material is incorporated by reference into the document . '' Advanced Display Sys. , Inc. v. Kent State Univ. , 212 F.3d 1272 , 1282 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . We have further explained that material incorporated by reference `` is effectively part of the host document as if it were explicitly contained therein . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Medrad concedes that the arguments made on infringement provide alternate bases to find in its favor and that the arguments need only be addressed if we were to reverse on the issue of validity .

Opinion concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part filed by Circuit Judge LINN . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ RADER , Circuit Judge . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The United States District Court for the District of Delaware determined on summary judgment that Transkaryotic Therapies , Inc. ( TKT ) did not infringe Genzyme Corporation 's and Mount Sinai School of Medicine 's ( collectively , Genzyme ) patent on methods of producing the human enzyme £\galactosidase A . Because Genzyme can not prove infringement of the properly construed claims , this court affirms . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ Genzyme Corporation is the exclusive licensee of U.S. Patent No . 5,356,804 ( the ¡¬804 patent ) , issued October 18 , 1994 , and assigned on its face to Mount Sinai School of Medicine of New York University . The ¡¬804 patent claims a method of producing human £\-galactosidase A ( £\-Gal-A ) and cells engineered to express and secrete active human £\-Gal-A . Administration of the £\-Gal A protein treats patients suffering from Fabry disease , a condition triggered by a deficiency in this enzyme . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The claims at issue in this appeal are independent claims 1 and 10 of the ¡¬ 804 patent , which read as follows ( emphases added ) : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A method for producing human £\-galactosidase A comprising : _NEWLINE_ ( a ) culturing a mammalian cell containing a chromosomally integrated nucleotide sequence encoding human £\-galactosidase A controlled by a regulatory sequence that promotes gene expression and a selectable marker controlled by the same or different regulatory sequence , so that the £\-galactosidase A nucleotide sequence is stably overexpressed and an enzymatically active £\-galactosidase A enzyme is secreted by the mammalian cell ; and _NEWLINE_ ( b ) isolating enzymatically active £\-galactosidase A enzyme from the mammalian cell culture . _NEWLINE_ 10 . A mammalian cell comprising a chromosomally integrated nucleotide sequence encoding human £\-galactosidase A controlled by a regulatory sequence that promotes gene expression and a selectable marker controlled by the same or different regulatory sequence , so that the £\-galactosidase A nucleotide sequence is stably overexpressed and an enzymatically active £\-galactosidase A enzyme is secreted by the mammalian cell . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Genzyme filed suit against TKT , alleging infringement of the ¡¬804 patent . TKT 's allegedly infringing product involves a technique known as gene activation . Under this technique , a DNA sequence acting as a promoter is inserted into a human host cell , whereupon the endogenous human cellular gene encoding £\-Gal A is activated to express the endogenous human £\-Gal A protein . It is undisputed that TKT 's technique does not introduce an exogenous £\-Gal A gene into human host cells . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court construed independent claims 1 and 10 of the ¡¬804 patent in a *1097 Markman hearing . See Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc. , 52 F.3d 967 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( en banc ) , aff 'd , 517 U.S. 370 , 116 S.Ct . 1384 , 134 L.Ed.2d 577 ( 1996 ) . The trial court specifically addressed four disputed claim terms . Of these disputed terms , the most important is `` chromosomally integrated , '' which the district court defined to mean `` the combining or bringing together or merging of separate elements , '' specifically the `` chromosome of a host cell '' and `` an exogenous nucleotide sequence encoding human £\-galactosidase A with a promoter and selectable marker . '' Genzyme Corp. v. Transkaryotic Therapies , Inc. , No . 00-677-GMS , 2001 WL 1530375 , at *1 ( D.Del . Nov.28 , 2001 ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following the Markman proceedings , both Genzyme and TKT moved for summary judgment on infringement . In its summary judgment motion for noninfringement , TKT explained that it produces human £\-Gal A from cells genetically engineered to overproduce this enzyme via gene activation . TKT 's gene activation process permits controlled expression of endogenous human £\-Gal A in target cells . TKT argued it does not practice the claimed method because the `` chromosomally integrated '' limitation requires exogenously introduced gene sequences , a step the gene activation protocol does not utilize . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A week after filing its motion for summary judgment of infringement , Genzyme asked the district court to clarify its interpretation of the claim term `` chromosomally integrated , '' particularly with respect to the meaning of the phrase `` exogenous nucleotide . '' The district court complied with Genzyme 's request , stating that the term `` exogenous '' referred to nucleotide sequences `` exogenous to the host cell , not exogenous to the chromosomal site . '' Based on this meaning of the term `` chromosomally integrated , '' Genzyme conceded it could not prevail on infringement . Thereafter , the district court issued an order granting TKT 's summary judgment motion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Genzyme timely appealed the district court 's decision , arguing that the district court erred in defining the claim terms `` chromosomally integrated , '' `` regulatory sequence , '' `` stably , '' and `` comprising . '' This court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear Genzyme 's appeal . 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 2000 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ Claim construction is a matter of law , which this court reviews without deference . Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs. , Inc. , 138 F.3d 1448 , 1456 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( en banc ) . This court also reviews grants of summary judgment without deference . Johns Hopkins Univ . v. Cellpro , Inc. , 152 F.3d 1342 , 1353 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` Chromosomally Integrated '' _NEWLINE_ The dispute in this case turns on the meaning of `` chromosomally integrated . '' Essentially , does the term `` chromosomally integrated '' require the action of inserting a human £\ A gene into the host chromosome , as argued by TKT , or can it cover a gene activation technique in which only a promoter sequence is inserted into a human host cell in order to activate the £\ A gene already present in the host cell , as argued by Genzyme . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court construed `` chromosomally integrated '' to mean `` the combining or bringing together or merging of separate elements . '' Further the district court reasoned : `` In this case , the separate elements that are combined are the chromosome of the host cell and an exogenous nucleotide sequence encoding human £\-galactosidase A with a promoter and selectable marker . '' *1098 Genzyme , 2001 WL 1530375 , at *1 ( emphasis added ) . Genzyme argues that the claims do not specify the origin of nucleotide sequences to be inserted into a target cell 's chromosome . According to Genzyme , the term `` chromosomally integrated '' requires only that `` a chromosome in the cell must contain a nucleotide sequence that encodes human £\-Gal A enzyme . '' In other words , Genzyme argues , this claim term `` requires the £\-Gal A coding sequence to be located in a chromosome , '' regardless of whether the coding sequence originated within the cell or outside the cell . Thus , Genzyme asserts that the district court impermissibly limited the claim to the preferred embodiment of integrating an £\-Gal A coding sequence into a host cell from an exogenous source . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The patent does not expressly define `` chromosomally integrated . '' Rather , this court , like the district court , must derive the meaning of the term from its usage and context . A fundamental principle for discerning a term 's usage is the ordinary and accustomed meaning of the words amongst artisans of ordinary skill in the relevant art at the time of invention . See Rexnord Corp. v. Laitram Corp. , 274 F.3d 1336 , 1342 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . Indeed , normal rules of usage suggest a `` heavy presumption '' that claim terms carry their accustomed meaning in the relevant community at the relevant time . CCS Fitness , Inc. v. Brunswick Corp. , 288 F.3d 1359 , 1366 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( citing Johnson Worldwide Assocs . Inc. v. Zebco Corp. , 175 F.3d 985 , 989 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ) . Of course , patent law has acknowledged that a patent applicant may overcome this presumption by clearly using the words in the specification , prosecution history , or both `` in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary meaning . '' Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica , Inc. v. Schering-Plough Corp. , 320 F.3d 1339 , 1347 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( citing Teleflex , Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am . Corp. , 299 F.3d 1313 , 1325-26 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ) . In other words , a patent applicant may consistently and clearly use a term in a manner either more or less expansive than its general usage in the relevant community , and thus expand or limit the scope of the term in the context of the patent claims . Ballard Med . Prods . v. Allegiance Healthcare Corp. , 268 F.3d 1352 , 1361 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( noting that an applicant may disclaim claim scope during prosecution ) ; Middleton , Inc. v. Minn. Mining & Mfg . Co. , 311 F.3d 1384 , 1388 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( explaining that in order to disavow claim scope , a patent applicant must clearly and unambiguously express surrender of subject matter during prosecution ) . In ascertaining the accustomed usage of the relevant community at the relevant time , dictionaries and treatises may serve to inform the courts . Tex . Digital Sys. , Inc. v. Telegenix , Inc. , 308 F.3d 1193 , 1202-03 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Standing alone , the words `` chromosomally integrated '' suggest uniting two separate portions of genetic material to form a more complete or purposeful whole . To one skilled in the art of molecular biology , `` integration '' generally means `` insertion [ of a DNA sequence ] into a host genome as a region covalently linked on either side to the host sequences . '' Benjamin Lewin , Genes IV 812 ( 1990 ) . Thus , the claim language suggests incorporation of exogenous genetic code into the chromosomal material of the host cell . In context , the asserted claims explain that the exogenous sequence has a regulatory sequence that causes the host cell to stably overexpress £\-Gal A . The cell then secretes the excess £\-Gal A . Again the word `` integrated '' suggests putting exogenous nucleotide sequences into the host cell 's chromosome to facilitate this process . This word , however , does not conclusively evince whether one of skill in the art at the time of the *1099 invention would understand the exogenous sequences to come from outside the host cell , i.e. , a vector , or from within the host cell but outside the critical chromosome , i.e. , a transposable element . In this regard , perhaps the best tool to put the claims in proper temporal and technical context is the patent specification itself . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Throughout the ¡¬804 patent specification , the applicant consistently uses the term `` integrated '' to refer to a foreign gene inserted into a host cell chromosome . See , e.g. , ¡¬804 patent at col. 14 , ll . 14-19 ( stable integration of plasmid DNA into host cell chromosomes ) ; col. 24 , ll . 42-46 ( transfection of human sequences into African green monkey kidney ( COS ) cells ) ; col. 24 , ll . 60-64 ( transfection of human sequences into Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells ) ; col. 25 , ll . 1-2 ( amplification of integrated plasmid DNA in CHO cells ) ; and col. 26 , ll . 59-66 ( transcription of stably integrated vector DNA in CHO cells ) . Indeed , the multitude of working examples , drawings , and diagrams of the ¡¬804 patent show the insertion of foreign £\-Gal-A coding sequences into host cells to generate excessive expression of the protein . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Notably , the `` Summary of the Invention '' explicitly states that the `` present invention , '' not merely a preferred embodiment , `` involves the production of large quantities of human £\-Gal A by cloning and expressing the £\-Gal A coding sequence in eukaryotic host cell expression systems . '' ¡¬804 patent , col. 6 , ll . 22-30 . Likewise , the abstract of the ¡¬804 patent describes recovery in `` good yield '' of `` recombinant £\-Gal A '' from `` engineered host cells . '' The patent thus specifically uses `` host cells '' to express large quantities of £\-Gal A . The term `` host cell '' means that the cell `` hosts '' or `` receives '' genetic material other than its own to perform its service . See Lewin , supra at 41 ( explaining that viruses lack a cellular structure of their own , and must infect a `` host cell '' to effect replication ) ; see also Bernard R. Glick and Jack J. Pasternak , Biotechnology 717 ( 2003 ) ( defining a `` host '' to be `` [ a ] microorganism , organism , or cell that maintains a cloning vector ) '' ; Chambers Dictionary of Science and Technology 570 ( Peter M.B . Walker , ed. , 1999 ) ( defining a `` host '' as meaning `` in molecular biology that in which a plasmid or virus can replicate '' ) . Thus , the invention involves `` cloning and expressing the £\-Gal A coding sequence in eukaryotic host cell expression systems , '' an explanation one of skill in the art would read as introducing exogenous cloned sequences into a host cell for expression . This definition of the invention does not embrace targeting or activation of an endogenous gene . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In reading the specification to teach that `` chromosomally integrated '' means introducing genetic material exogenous to a host cell , not just a chromosome , this court is aware that various portions of the patent vaguely refer to using less than the full endogenous coding sequence for expressing £\-Gal A . In section 5.1 , entitled `` The £\-Gal A CODING SEQUENCE , '' the patent recites : _NEWLINE_ Although portions of the coding sequences may be utilized , full length clones , i.e. , those containing the entire coding region for £\-Gal A , may be preferable for expression . _NEWLINE_ '804 patent , col. 10 , ll . 61-63 ; see also , col. 10 , ll . 51-52 . In the first place , this passage does not expressly refer to activation of endogenous genes at all . Rather in context , this passage merely explains that less than the entire coding sequence may be used to express a functional £\-Gal A protein . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Indeed , this passage in context explains that this potential abbreviated coding sequence would come from outside the host *1100 cell . Specifically , the patent proceeds to explain in section 5.2 that `` [ i ] n order to express a biologically active £\-Gal A , the coding sequence for the enzyme , a functional equivalent , or a modified sequence , as described in Section 5.1. , supra , is inserted into an appropriate eukaryotic expression vector , i.e . a vector which contains the necessary elements for transcription and translation of the inserted coding sequence in appropriate eukaryotic host cells . '' ¡¬804 patent at col. 12 , ll . 35-42 ( emphasis added ) . Once again , the specification emphasizes introduction of exogenous genetic material into host cells . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Similarly , one sentence fragment taken out of context in column 14 , lines 10-14 , mentions transforming a host cell with a controllable DNA , rather than the entire £\-Gal A sequence : `` [ H ] ost cells can be transformed with the £\-Gal A or DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements ( e.g . promoter ... ) , and a selectable marker . '' This reference , however , falls under the heading `` Construction of Expression Vectors and Preparation of Transfectants . '' This entire section refers to creating a vector for `` expression of £\-Gal A in the [ chosen ] host cell . '' ¡¬804 patent , col. 13 , ll . 11-13 ; see also , col. 12 , ll . 55-58 . Indeed the sentence preceding the fragment out of context refers expressly to the `` introduction of foreign DNA , '' not targeting of endogenous DNA : _NEWLINE_ For long-term , high yield production of recombinant proteins , stable expression is preferred . For example , following introduction of foreign DNA , engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media , and then switched to a selective media . Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication , host cells can be transformed with the £\-Gal A or DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements ( e.g . promoter , enhancer , sequences , transcription terminators , polyadenylation sites , etc . ) , and a selectable marker . The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines . ( Emphasis added . ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ '804 patent , col. 14 , ll . 4-19 . The underlined sentence fragment from column 14 , when read in context , does not suggest that gene targeting of endogenous coding sequences is possible within a host cell . Rather , the passage states host cells may be `` transformed with the £\-Gal A '' ( i.e . the gene in its entirety ) or with `` DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements and a selectable marker . '' As noted in bold type above , the DNA in column 14 is foreign DNA introduced into host cells via vectors . The passage teaches that expression vectors containing viral origins of replication are not used to facilitate stable expression of £\-Gal A . Instead , column 14 teaches the use of recombinant plasmids containing other expression control elements , such as promoters and enhancers , to continuously drive the expression of the £\-Gal A DNA located in the plasmids for `` long-term , high-yield production of recombinant proteins . '' ¡¬804 patent at col. 14 , ll . 4-19 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Therefore , the sentence fragment in column 14 , when read in context , teaches the introduction into host cells of exogenous DNA encoding £\-Gal A , together with promoters and enhancers in recombinant plasmids . This passage does not suggest the introduction into a cell of expression control elements and a portion of a coding sequence to drive the expression of genes endogenously located within the host cell . Thus , the isolated passages in columns 10 and 14 do not even remotely suggest that *1101 `` chromosomally integrated '' means targeting of sequences encoding £\-Gal A that are endogenous to a host cell . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Even if , arguendo , the cited passages did teach an example of gene targeting , such gene targeting would still require the introduction of exogenous nucleotide sequences encoding human £\-Gal A. Gene targeting typically involves the transfection of a vector containing a gene sequence into a cell containing an endogenous form of the gene . Upon transfection , the exogenous vector targets the endogenous gene , homologous recombination occurs , and exogenous sequences become part of the genome.1 This process requires the introduction of at least some foreign gene DNA into the host cell , and is not the same as transposable elements rearranging genes within a cell . No record evidence suggests that the specification contemplates , much less defines , the integration and expression of genes outside a chosen chromosome , but within a cell via transposable elements . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The prosecution history , like the specification , does not permit a broad interpretation of the claim term `` chromosomally integrated . '' The original claims of the ¡¬804 patent recited a method of producing human £\-Gal A protein and cells for producing this enzyme transformed with a recombinant vector encoding £\-Gal A . The examiner rejected these claims under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 ( 1 ) for lack of enablement because the applicant had not deposited the claimed vector . The examiner considered the deposit `` essential '' to the claimed invention . The applicant conceded , and made the deposit without arguing against the requirement . Thus , during prosecution , the applicant agreed that the pending claims required a recombinant vector encoding £\-Gal A . Later , the applicant amended the claims to remove the term `` recombinant vector , '' but neither the examiner nor the applicant suggested that the amendment rendered the deposit unnecessary . Thus , the prosecution history shows the necessity of the deposited exogenous vector sequences to the ¡¬804 patent claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ During prosecution , the applicant also made arguments to overcome prior art that are inconsistent with a broad interpretation of the claim term `` chromosomally integrated . '' The examiner rejected the claims under 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 102 and 103 in view of prior art that allegedly taught the assembly of expression vectors containing human £\-Gal A sequences . Specifically , the examiner rejected the pending claims over `` the genomic clone containing the promoter for the human £\-Gal A gene disclosed by Quinn , or the £\-GalA cDNAs disclosed by Tsuji , Bishop , Coppola or Calhoun . '' Based on this prior art , according to the examiner , `` it would have been obvious to assemble other expression vectors containing full length £\-GalA gene sequences . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1102 The applicant responded by distinguishing the prior art . In particular , the applicant noted that the prior art references achieved only low level , transient , expression of human £\-Gal A when full-length cDNA sequences were introduced into COS cells . According to the applicant , transient expression systems of Tsuji and Bishop `` could not be utilized to produce £\-Gal A , since recombinant protein could not be recovered from the system . '' The applicant further stated : `` In contrast to the prior art failures , and to the Applicants ' surprise , the human £\-GalA gene product , when stably expressed in mammalian cell systems , is not only expressed at remarkably high levels , but is actually selectively secreted at very high levels out of the host cell so that facile recovery of the active product is finally made possible . '' The applicant then stressed that recovery of active £\-Gal A was an element of the pending method claims.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These arguments did not persuade the examiner , who again issued the same rejections . The examiner noted : `` The selection of the appropriate plasmids , promoters , selectable markers and cell lines for proper expression of the inserted gene is merely a matter of judicious selection , within the scope of the ability of one ordinarily skilled in the art . '' Without further recourse , the applicant submitted an amendment after final rejection under 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.116 . This amendment to clarify the points of disagreement with the examiner also included a declaration by Dr. Ira Mellman . In his declaration , Dr. Mellman asserted his surprise at the inventive expression scheme disclosed in the denied claims , noting the difficulty of purifying heterologously expressed recombinant proteins . By definition , a heterologously expressed recombinant protein is not naturally or normally expressed by a particular tissue or cell type . A `` heterologoous protein '' is recognized by those of skill in the art as being a recombinant protein `` whose amino acid sequence is encoded by a cloned gene . '' Glick , supra at 717 , 725 ; see also J.M . Lackie and J.A . T. Dow , The Dictionary of Cell and Molecular Biology , 212 ( 1999 ) ( defining heterologous to mean `` [ d ] erived from the tissues or DNA of a different species '' ) ; Encyclopedia of Microbiology , 1012 ( Joshua Lederberg , ed. , 2000 ) ( defining `` heterologous '' to mean `` derived from a different source or species ; not native to the host '' ) . Dr. Mellman did not suggest that the claimed expression method embraced expression of endogenous genes . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , in its clarifying amendment , the applicant stressed again that the prior art did not teach the `` stable expression of human £\-galactosidase A and isolation of enzymatically active £\-galactosidase A from an engineered mammalian cell system . '' Eukaryotic host expression systems , such as the systems delineated in section 5.2.1 of the ¡¬804 patent , have long been understood by those of skill in the art as expression vector systems that facilitate expression of eukaryotic genes . See James D. Watson , et al. , Molecular Biology of the Gene , 614 , 615 ( 1987 ) ( `` The more we learn about how gene expression is controlled in eucaryotes , the more intelligently we can develop expression vector systems ... . Several factors already encourage the development of eucaryotic systems for the expression of eucaryotic genes . `` ) ; Susan Bright , et al. , From Laboratory to Clinic : The Development of an Immunological Reagent , 112 Immunology Today 130-31 ( 1991 ) ( discussing `` eukaryotic *1103 expression systems , '' including CHO cells transfected with an expression plasmid for the production of recombinant antibodies ) ; Glick , supra , at 181-87 ( describing `` mammalian cell expression systems '' as being composed of cell lines , such as COS and CHO cells , engineered with mammalian expression vectors to express heterologous proteins ) . In other words , the applicant expressly confined the invention to production of proteins by introducing vectors into a mammalian host cell . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The examiner persisted in the rejection until the applicant submitted a supplemental amendment under 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.116 . The amendment replaced the phrase `` transformed with a recombinant vector which includes a nucleotide sequence encoding £\-galactosidase A '' with the phrase `` chromosomally integrated nucleotide sequence encoding human £\-galactosidase A . '' The examiner and applicant agreed on this language during an after-final rejection examiner interview . The record does not explain the reasons the examiner finally accepted this language . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Contrary to Genzyme 's position , this eleventh-hour amendment did not operate to broaden the claims to eliminate the requirement of insertion of an exogenous gene into a host cell . In the first place , the deposit requirement , the specification , the applicant 's arguments to distinguish prior art , the examiner 's responses , and Dr. Mellman 's declaration repeatedly stressed that the invention envisioned insertion of an exogenous gene sequence into a host cell . A clarifying amendment at the last moment could not negate that extensive public record . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ More important , the examiner could not accept a second ( supplemental ) after-final amendment broadening the scope of the rejected claims without formal comment from the applicant . Under the applicable Patent Office rules , amendments to patent claims after final rejection can not alter the substantive scope of the claims without explanation about the necessity of the amendment and without reasons for the delay in proposing the change.3 See 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.116 ( b ) ( 1992 ) ( `` If amendments touching the merits of the application ... are presented after final rejection ... they may be admitted upon showing of good and sufficient reasons why they are necessary and were not earlier presented. '' ) . If this amendment markedly broadened the claims , it satisfied neither of those requirements . The record supplies no explanation from the applicant or the examiner that these changes were both `` necessary '' and justifiably `` not earlier presented . '' Thus , according to PTO rules , the examiner could not have allowed this amendment if it changed at all the scope of the claims set forth in the deposit requirement , the specification , the arguments of the applicant , and Dr. Mellman 's declaration . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The record instead suggests that the examiner felt this last-minute change did not alter the scope of the claims . The examiner 's comments did not distinguish these newly amended claims from the prior art , but simply noted that the claims had to recite that the £\-Gal A was overexpressed and secreted . Likewise , the applicant did not address any change in the *1104 scope of the claims . In any event , the examiner could not have permitted any Rule 116 amendment that expanded the claims to make the introduction of exogenous DNA into a host cell optional . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , the prosecution history indicates that the term `` chromosomally integrated '' requires introduction of exogenous £\-Gal A sequences into the host cell . The claims of the ¡¬804 patent recited these exogenously introduced £\-Gal A sequences until after prosecution on the merits was closed . The record simply does not show that the examiner , contrary to PTO rules , vastly broadened these claims upon entering the supplemental after final amendment to embrace overexpression of human £\-Gal A sequences endogenous to a host cell . The informed public could only understand this prosecution history , as well as the specification and the claim language itself , to limit Genzyme as reflected throughout the prosecution . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ TKT argues that if this court reads the claims as suggested by Genzyme , they would be invalid . Indeed this court notes that the ¡¬804 specification and figures do not discuss any methods of activating endogenous £\-Gal A gene sequences . In fact , the specification does not discuss `` chromosomally integrated '' sequences as endogenous £\-Gal A genes within the host cells at all . Thus , the record would appear to raise questions of enablement . See Modine Mfg . Co. v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 75 F.3d 1545 , 1557 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( this court interprets claims `` so as to preserve their validity '' whenever `` reasonably possible '' ) . The district court , however , did not decide validity issues , and this court need not examine enablement to properly define the claim term `` chromosomally integrated '' in view of the specification and prosecution history . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court also notes that this case is different from Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel , Inc. , 314 F.3d 1313 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) , which accorded a broad reading to similar claims . This court in Amgen did not confront a prosecution history and specification that conclusively limits the scope of the disputed claim terms . In this case , both the specification and the prosecution history indicate that the patentee employed the term `` chromosomally integrated '' in a manner inconsistent with a broad textbook meaning that envelopes both endogenous and exogenous sources of sequences encoding genes in a host cell . See Bruce Alberts , et al. , Molecular Biology of the Cell , 247-50 ( 1983 ) ( discussing integration of transposable elements into the genomes of cells ) ; Lewin , supra at 697-702 ( discussing the introduction and integration of exogenous donor DNA into recipient cells in generating stably expressing host cell lines and transgenic animals ) . Therefore , the district court did not err in construing this claim term to require the introduction into a host cell of exogenous sequences encoding £\-Gal A . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` Regulatory Sequence '' _NEWLINE_ The district court construed `` regulatory sequence '' in the first occurrence to mean `` any and all sequences required for gene expression of the human £\-galactosidase A gene , consisting of at least one sequence which promotes gene expression . '' Column 14 , ll . 9-14 , of the ¡¬804 patent discloses several examples of regulatory sequences that are appropriate expression control elements . While the specification teaches a process requiring one or more of these elements to transform cells with £\-Gal A DNA , it does not teach that all of them are required . The district court erred in this regard , but the error is harmless in view of the trial court 's proper construction of the claim term `` chromosomally integrated . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1105 `` Stably '' _NEWLINE_ The district court construed the claim term `` stably '' in the phrase `` stably overexpressed '' to require that `` the nucleotide sequence encoding human £\-galactosidase A stays in place once integrated into the chromosome , i.e . the chromosomal change is not transient . '' During prosecution , the examiner rejected the claims for indefiniteness under ¡± 112 ( 2 ) . In response , the applicant gave the examiner a definition of `` stably , '' namely a `` stable level and duration of expression of the human £\-galactosidase A gene . '' This definition , as the applicant noted , `` denotes persistent expression , as distinguished from the short-term transient expression systems of the prior art . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Indeed the specification discloses several working examples that show the stable expression of the human £\-galactosidase A gene . The specification particularly points out that the applicant disclosed high levels of £\-Gal A expression can be achieved with vectors that do not integrate into the host 's chromosome . Instead , these vectors achieve stable extra-chromosomal expression via transcription of cDNA in the presence of a selectable marker . See ¡¬804 patent at col. 13 , ll . 63-67 . Thus , the invention as described in the specification achieves stable expression by chromosomal integration and extra-chromosomal gene expression . The applicant surrendered the extra-chromosomal embodiment of stable expression during prosecution . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , the district court correctly discerned that the claims only embrace stable expression of gene sequences integrated into a host 's chromosome . However , the specification and prosecution history do not discuss this stability in terms of duration of chromosomal change . Rather , the applicant explicitly described the term `` stably '' as referring to the level and duration of gene expression . Therefore , the district court erred in construing this term , but the error is harmless given the proper construction of the claim term `` chromosomally integrated . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ After construing the claims of the ¡¬804 patent , the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement to TKT . Summary judgment is appropriate `` if the pleadings , depositions , answers to interrogatories , and admissions on file , together with the affidavits , if any , show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law . '' Fed.R.Civ.P . 56 ( c ) ; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317 , 322 , 106 S.Ct . 2548 , 91 L.Ed.2d 265 ( 1986 ) . In deciding whether a genuine issue of material fact exists , this court draws all justifiable inferences in the nonmovant 's favor . Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , Inc. , 477 U.S. 242 , 255 , 106 S.Ct . 2505 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 ( 1986 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As noted above , the TKT method of overexpression involves gene activation . Under this method , TKT inserts promoters into human host cells that `` switch on '' the endogenous human cellular gene encoding £\-Gal A. TKT 's protocol does not introduce exogenous genes into host cells . Genzyme hinged its claim of infringement on a claim interpretation broad enough to encompass gene targeting . TKT provided declaratory evidence showing that the ¡¬804 patent did not teach one of skill in the art a workable method of introducing an exogenous gene sequence into a cell to recombine with an endogenous gene residing in the host chromosome ( gene targeting ) to facilitate gene activation . The district court did not decide this validity issue , but instead , after construing the claims , credited TKT 's declaratory evidence that its gene activation method does not infringe Genzyme 's process . Genzyme concedes it *1106 can not show infringement by TKT if the ¡¬804 patent claims require the introduction into a host cell of exogenous sequences encoding £\-Gal A . Because the claims require this exogenous sequence element , Genzyme 's concession precludes a finding that TKT infringes the asserted claims of the ¡¬804 patent . Therefore , the district court properly granted summary judgment of noninfringement to TKT . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The district court properly construed the claim term `` chromosomally integrated , '' but erred in construing the disputed terms `` regulatory sequence '' and `` stably . '' However , because the construction of the claim term `` chromosomally integrated '' precludes Genzyme from showing infringement , these latter errors are harmless . Therefore , this court affirms the district court 's grant of summary judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ Each party shall bear its own costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ LINN , Circuit Judge , concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While I concur in the majority 's construction of the claim limitations `` regulatory sequence '' and `` stably overexpressed , '' I must respectfully dissent from its conclusion regarding the construction of the `` chromosomally integrated '' limitation . In my view , the restriction of the scope of this limitation to require the introduction into a host cell of `` exogenous sequences encoding £\-Gal A , '' Genzyme , slip op . at 1105 , unadvisedly reads limitations from the specification into the claims . I can discern no proper basis to do so and would give the `` chromosomally integrated '' limitation the full scope of its ordinary and customary meaning . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . CLAIM CONSTRUCTION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Ordinary and Customary Meaning _NEWLINE_ It is well settled in our jurisprudence that claim terms are to be given their ordinary and customary meaning to one of skill in the relevant art . Johnson Worldwide Assocs. , Inc. v. Zebco Corp. , 175 F.3d 985 , 989 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . Determining the ordinary and customary meaning of the terms of the claims is the first step in claim construction , and consultation of the written description and prosecution history before attempting to ascertain the ordinary and customary meaning of the language of the claims is premature . Tex . Digital Sys. , Inc. v. Telegenix , Inc. , 308 F.3d 1193 , 1204 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . Where the patentee 's choice of a claim term `` deprive [ s ] the claim of clarity , ' `` CCS Fitness , Inc. v. Brunswick Corp. , 288 F.3d 1359 , 1367 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) , however , the court must `` resort to the other intrinsic evidence , '' id. , to determine the meaning of the claim terms . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In my view , the majority hastens too quickly past the fundamental step of determining the ordinary and customary meaning of `` chromosomally integrated . '' It relies on a single definition of `` integration , '' defined in the context of `` viral or another DNA sequence , '' to import the concept of a `` host genome . '' Genzyme , slip op . at 1098 ; Benjamin Lewin , Genes IV 812 ( 1990 ) . In light of this imported concept of a `` host cell , '' the majority perceives ambiguity as to `` whether one of skill in the art at the time of the invention would understand the exogenous sequences to come from outside the host cell , i.e. , a vector , or from within the host cell but outside the critical chromosome , i.e. , a transposable element . `` 4 *1107 Genzyme , slip op . at 1098 . It then turns to the specification to resolve this perceived ambiguity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With all due respect to my colleagues , there is no ambiguity here to be resolved . The majority opinion establishes that the term `` chromosomally integrated '' could be used in reference to the incorporation into a chromosome of either endogenous or exogenous DNA , that is to say , DNA sequences that have their origin either inside or outside the cell to which the chromosome is native . The ordinary and customary meaning of the term broadly encompasses both possibilities . It is incorrect to perceive a claim term as ambiguous merely because of its breadth and to require that the term be redefined to encompass only a portion of its ordinary meaning in the name of clarity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Technical treatises publicly available at the time a patent is issued may be consulted as `` reliable sources of information that would have been attributed to the terms of the claims by those of skill in the art . '' Tex . Digital Sys. , 308 F.3d at 1202-03 . See also Inverness Med . Switz . GmbH v. Princeton Biomeditech Corp. , 309 F.3d 1365 , 1370 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( `` We may look , therefore , to the dictionary definition of the claim term mobility as of the date the patents issued. '' ) . A review of the relevant technical treatises contemporaneous with the issuance of the ¡¬804 patent shows that `` chromosomally integrated '' had a broad meaning , encompassing the integration of both exogenous and endogenous DNA . The Genes IV text that the majority cites uses the term `` integrated '' to describe both the incorporation of viral DNA of extracellular origin , Genes IV 674 ( 1990 ) ( `` One or more [ viral ] DNA copies become integrated into the host genome . `` ) , and the transposition of yeast transposable elements from one site to another within the same genome , id . at 681 ( describing yeast Ty transposable elements as subject to `` reverse transcription and integration '' ) . Transposable elements , such as retroposons , were understood at the time to be a part of an organism 's own genome . Id . at 672 ( `` [ W ] e think of retroposons as genomic ( duplex DNA ) sequences that occasionally transpose within a genome ; they do not migrate between cells. '' ) . Another contemporaneous leading text similarly describes both viral DNA and transposable element DNA as integrating into the chromosome . Bruce Alberts et al. , Molecular Biology of the Cell 255 ( 1989 ) ( `` [ T ] he DNA circle [ of the transposable element ] integrates into a randomly selected site on the chromosome . '' ) The term `` chromosomally integrated '' was thus commonly understood by those of skill in the art at the time to refer to the incorporation into a chromosome of DNA that either came from another site in the same genome or from outside the cell . This is the ordinary and customary meaning of the claim term . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B.The Intrinsic Record _NEWLINE_ The next step in the claim construction process in this case , as in every case , is to examine the intrinsic evidence , comprising the claims , the written description , and the prosecution history if in evidence , to determine whether the patentee has rebutted the presumption that `` chromosomally integrated '' has its ordinary and customary meaning . See Brookhill-Wilk 1 , LLC v. *1108 Intuitive Surgical , Inc. , 334 F.3d 1294 , 1298 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ; Tex . Digital Sys. , 308 F.3d at 1204 . A patentee may rebut this presumption by `` defin [ ing ] claim terminology in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary meaning , '' Biovail Corp. Int ' l v. Andrx Pharms. , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1297 , 1301 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) , or by disclaiming a particular interpretation of a claim term during prosecution , Biodex Corp. v. Loredan Biomedical , Inc. , 946 F.2d 850 , 863 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . I find no redefinition of the claim term in the intrinsic evidence , nor do I discern any disclaimer of coverage of the integration of endogenous DNA . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The word `` integrated '' or `` integration '' appears nine times in the sixty-page ¡¬804 written description . None of these instances on its own amounts to a `` special definition ... clearly stated in the patent specification . '' Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576 , 1582 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . The majority correctly notes that `` the applicant consistently uses the term 'integrated ' to refer to a foreign gene inserted into a host cell chromosome . '' Genzyme , slip op . at 1099 . However , this use of `` integrated '' is not `` inconsistent with [ its ] ordinary meaning , '' Vitronics Corp. , 90 F.3d at 1582 , and can not therefore be used to show that the patentee has redefined the term `` with reasonable clarity , deliberateness , and precision , '' In re Paulsen , 30 F.3d 1475 , 1480 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . As the majority demonstrates , the ordinary and customary meaning of `` integrated '' embraces the incorporation of both exogenous and endogenous DNA . It is immaterial to the proper construction of `` integrated '' that the embodiments consistently employ exogenous DNA . Absent a redefinition or disclaimer relating to a claim term , consistent use in the written description of a term in a narrower meaning can not trump a broader ordinary and customary meaning of the term as used in a claim . Were it otherwise , the scope of claim terms would regularly be limited to the embodiments disclosed in the specification . But it is the claim language , not the embodiments , which control . See Renishaw PLC v. Marposs Societa ' per Azioni , 158 F.3d 1243 , 1248 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( [ T ] he claims define the scope of the right to exclude ; the claim construction inquiry , therefore , begins and ends in all cases with the actual words of the claim. ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The majority also cites the `` Summary of the Invention '' section , where `` the present invention '' is said to involve `` host cell expression systems , '' and the abstract , which refers to `` engineered host cells . '' ¡¬804 patent , col. 6 , ll . 22-25 ; Abstract . The majority contends that the term `` host cell '' necessarily implies the introduction of exogenous genetic material , and this amounts to a `` definition of the invention . '' Genzyme , slip op . at 1099-1100 . In other words , the majority sees a redefinition of the claim term `` chromosomally integrated '' in the use in the specification of a term , `` host cell , '' that appears nowhere in the claims . In my view , the majority roams too far afield in search of a redefinition of the claim term . It is clear from our precedent that any redefinition must focus on the term actually employed in the claims . See Teleflex , Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am . Corp. , 299 F.3d 1313 , 1324 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( `` The claim language defines the bounds of claim scope . `` ) ; Interactive Gift Express , Inc. v. Compuserve Inc. , 256 F.3d 1323 , 1331 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( `` In construing claims , the analytical focus must begin and remain centered on the language of the claims themselves , for it is that language that the patentee chose to use to 'particularly point [ ] out and distinctly claim [ ] the subject matter which the patentee regards as his invention . ' `` ) ; Thermalloy , Inc. v. Aavid Eng ' g , Inc. , 121 F.3d 691 , 693 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( `` [ T ] hroughout the interpretation *1109 process , the focus remains on the meaning of claim language. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Like the written description , nothing in the prosecution history limits or redefines the scope or meaning of `` chromosomally integrated . '' The majority stresses the fact that `` during prosecution , the applicant agreed that the pending claims required a recombinant vector encoding £\-Gal A . '' Genzyme , slip op . at 1101 . However , this was predicated on the fact that the set of claims then pending explicitly required the use of a recombinant vector . The Examiner made clear that a deposit of the vector was required because the vector was present in the claims : _NEWLINE_ Since the vector ( s ) is/are essential to the claimed invention it must be obtainable by a repeatable method set forth in the specification or otherwise be readily available to the public . If the vector ( s ) is/are not so obtainable or available , the requirements of 35 USC 112 may be satisfied by deposit ( s ) of the vector ( s ) . _NEWLINE_ As the majority notes , the claims were later amended to remove the term `` recombinant vector , '' and the issued claims do not contain such a limitation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Despite the removal of that limitation , however , the majority maintains that the deposited vector sequence remained necessary to the claimed invention , and this mandates a restriction of the scope of `` chromosomally integrated . '' I can not agree . The deposit of the recombinant vector was required by the Examiner to establish enablement of then-pending claims that explicitly required its use . When the use of a recombinant vector was eliminated from the claims , the predicate for the Examiner 's deposition requirement evaporated . There is no reason to conclude in this case that an action taken as a result of the presence of a specific term in the claims should continue to bind the patentee when that term is removed during prosecution and does not appear in the issued claims . See Smith v. Snow , 294 U.S. 1 , 16 , 55 S.Ct . 279 , 79 L.Ed . 721 ( 1935 ) ( `` It is of no moment that in the course of the proceedings in the Patent Office the rejection of narrow claims was followed by the allowance of the broader claim 1 . `` ) ; United States v. Telectronics , Inc. , 857 F.2d 778 , 783 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( The arguments emphasizing the use of a skin electrode , which were made at the time the application claims explicitly contained such a limitation , can not furnish a basis for restricting issued claim 1 , which lacks any such limitation . ) ; Kistler Instrumente AG . v. United States , 224 Ct.Cl . 370 , 628 F.2d 1303 , 1308 ( 1980 ) ( [ D ] efendant 's insistance [ sic ] upon this court 's reading back into the claims limitations which were originally there and were removed during prosecution of the application through the Patent Office can not be permitted. ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The majority doubts , however , whether the removal of the recombinant vector limitation from the issued claims actually represented a broadening of the claims . Given that the amendment occurred at a late stage of prosecution , the majority states that if it were in fact broadening , the amendment would have been a violation of 37 C.F.R . 1.116 ( b ) , because the patentee made no showing of good and sufficient reasons why [ it was ] necessary and [ was ] not earlier presented . 37 C.F.R . 1.116 ( b ) ( 1992 ) . A decision restricting the scope of an otherwise unambiguous claim term based on an applicants presumed noncompliance with a procedural rule of the PTO strikes me as ill-founded . See Dethmers Mfg . Co. , Inc. v. Automatic Equip . Mfg . Co. , 293 F.3d 1364 , 1366 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ( Linn , J. , dissenting from the order denying rehearing en banc ) ( [ O ] nce a patent issues , non-compliance with a procedural rule administered by the PTO within the scope of the agency 's statutory authority *1110 and found , by virtue of the grant of the patent , to have been satisfied during prosecution is , in and of itself , of no consequence. ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The majority also relies on arguments distinguishing certain prior art references to establish that the patentee `` expressly confined the invention to production of proteins by introducing vectors into a mammalian host cell . '' Genzyme , slip op . at 1102-1103 . To establish a disclaimer or disavowal of claim scope , of course , a patentee must use `` words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction , representing a clear disavowal of claim scope . '' Tex . Digital Sys. , 308 F.3d at 1204 . The majority finds such a manifest exclusion of the use of a cell 's own endogenous DNA in the patentee 's assertions that the claimed invention was capable of recovering `` recombinant protein , '' and that such `` heterologously expressed recombinant proteins '' are difficult to purify . Genzyme , slip op . at 1101-1102 . The patentee also referred to the claimed invention 's use of `` an engineered mammalian cell system . '' Id. , slip op . at 1102-1103 . I see no clear disavowal of the use of endogenous DNA in these remarks . Neither Tsuji nor Bishop employed endogenous DNA . The essence of the patentee 's argument was that , while the prior art employed exogenous DNA to achieve a low level of transient expression , the claimed invention was `` the first demonstration of the stable , overexpression , selective secretion , and subsequent isolation of a lysosomal enzyme in a recombinant mammalian cell system . '' Whether the prior art references integrated the cell 's own DNA into a different chromosomal site was simply not at issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . ENABLEMENT _NEWLINE_ The majority notes that `` the record would appear to raise questions of enablement , '' although it also states that `` this court need not examine enablement to properly define the claim term 'chromosomally integrated ' in view of the specification and prosecution history . '' Genzyme , slip op . at 1104 . To the extent that enablement concerns underlie the majority 's narrowing of the scope of `` chromosomally integrated , '' however , I suggest that such issues are not yet ripe for consideration . The district court has not yet addressed validity , and the parties did not brief the issue on appeal . Although this court has stated that claims should be interpreted so as to preserve their validity whenever reasonably possible , Modine Mfg . Co. v. United States Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 75 F.3d 1545 , 1557 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) , it is wrong to allow enablement issues that have not yet been fully ventilated by the parties and the district court to influence a claim construction determination . I agree that all validity concerns should be left for another day . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 346 F.3d 1094 , 68 U.S.P.Q.2d 1596 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Gene targeting is described in a 1987 Cell article ( Kirk Thomas and Mario Capecchi , Site-Directed Mutageneis by Gene Targeting in Mouse Embryo-Derived Stem Cells , 51Cell 503-12 ( 1987 ) ) and a 1985 Nature article ( Oliver Smithies , et al. , Insertion of DNA Sequences Into the Human Chromosomal £]-globin Locus by Homologous Recombination , 317 Nature 230-34 ( 1985 ) ) , both of which are of record . The Thomas article notes : `` Gene targeting-the homologous recombination of DNA sequences residing in the chromosome with newly introduced DNA sequences-provides a means for systematically altering the mammalian genome ... . A desired alteration would first be introduced into a cloned DNA sequence , and gene targeting would then transfer the alteration into the genome . '' The Smithies article states : `` [ t ] he experiments reported here establish that the planned modification of a specific human gene can be accomplished in mammalian cells by homologous recombination without detectably affecting other parts of the genome . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Secretion of enzymatically active £\-galactosidase A is an element of all of the claims issued in the ¡¬804 patent , and isolation of this active enzyme is an element of all method claims of the ¡¬804 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dissent contends that non-compliance with a Patent Office procedural rule is of no consequence once a patent issues . Dissent , slip . op . at 8 . However , this court presumes that the Patent Office complies with its own rules , a presumption overcome only upon presentation of contrary evidence . Rite-Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co. , Inc. , 819 F.2d 1120 , 1123 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ( `` Kelley has provided neither evidence nor inference to overcome the presumption that the PTO complied with its own rules. '' ) . Therefore , without record support , an argument alleging dereliction of duty by a patent examiner is without merit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The majority 's claim construction analysis frames the question as whether `` chromosomally integrated '' can be construed to `` cover a gene activation technique in which only a promoter sequence is inserted into a human host cell in order to activate the £\-Gal A gene already present in the host cell , '' Genzyme , slip op . at 4 , which is a description of TKT 's allegedly infringing technique . I believe the question is misdirected . Our precedent informs that `` claims [ should ] not be construed by reference to the accused device . '' NeoMagic Corp. v.

The Virginia District Court granted the motion of Lupin Ltd. and Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( collectively Lupin ) for summary judgment of noninfringement . In the other case , the Illinois District Court denied a preliminary injunction to Abbott Laboratories , the exclusive licensee of the ¡¬507 patent , based on the claim construction from the Eastern District of Virginia . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because the Eastern District of Virginia correctly construed the claims of the ¡¬507 patent and correctly discerned no genuine issues of material fact on literal infringement of claims 2-5 or infringement by equivalents of claims 1-5 , this court affirms its partial summary judgment of noninfringement . Likewise , this court affirms the Northern District of Illinois ' denial of Abbott 's motion for a preliminary injunction , based in large part on the same correct claim construction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ Abbott Laboratories , the exclusive licensee of the ¡¬507 patent , markets crystalline cefdinir according to the ¡¬507 patent under the trade name Omnicef . The Virginia case arose when Lupin sought a declaratory judgment of noninfringement against Abbott Laboratories and Astellas Pharma Inc. , the owner of the ¡¬507 patent ( collectively Abbott ) . The Food and Drug Administration had previously approved Lupin 's Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) to market a generic version of Omnicef . Lupin 's generic product contains almost exclusively the Crystal B form of crystalline cefdinir ( cefdinir monohydrate ) , whereas Abbott 's Omnicef product contains the Crystal A form of crystalline cefdinir ( cefdinir anhydrate ) . Further , Lupin makes its products with processes other than those claimed in the ¡¬507 patent . For these reasons , Lupin brought the Virginia action to clarify that its proposed product would not infringe a valid patent . Abbott counterclaimed for infringement . The Eastern District of Virginia construed the claims , Lupin Ltd. v. Abbott Laboratories , 484 F.Supp.2d 448 ( E.D.Va.2007 ) ( Lupin CC Order ) , and ultimately granted-in-part Lupin 's motion for summary judgment of noninfringement , as to both literal and equivalent infringement for claims 2-5 and as to equivalent infringement for claim 1 , Lupin Ltd. v. Abbott Labs. , 491 F.Supp.2d 563 ( E.D.Va.2007 ) ( Lupin SJ Order ) . The parties stipulated to the dismissal without prejudice of the remaining claims ( invalidity ) and counterclaims ( literal infringement of claim 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the Illinois action , Abbott sued Sandoz , Inc. and Sandoz GmbH ( collectively Sandoz ) , Teva Pharmaceuticals USA , Inc. *1286 and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries , Ltd. ( collectively Teva ) , Ranbaxy Laboratories , Ltd. , Ranbaxy , Inc. , Par Pharmaceutical Companies , Inc. , and Par Pharmaceutical ( all defendants , collectively , Sandoz and Teva ) for infringement of the ¡¬507 patent . Like Lupin , Sandoz and Teva had previously filed ANDAs , seeking to market generic versions of Omnicef . Abbott sought a preliminary injunction in the Illinois case . For purposes of that motion , the parties agreed to adopt the Eastern District of Virginia 's claim construction from the Lupin case . Abbott Labs . v. Sandoz , Inc. , 486 F.Supp.2d 767 ( N.D.Ill.2007 ) ( Sandoz PI Order ) . Despite this agreement , the parties to the Sandoz case disagreed as to how to interpret some of the Eastern District of Virginia 's constructions , necessitating some clarification by the Northern District of Illinois . 486 F.Supp.2d at 770-71 ( disputing `` Crystal A , '' `` peaks , '' and `` about , '' and seeking construction of `` powder X-ray diffraction pattern , '' which the Eastern District of Virginia had not defined ) . Ultimately , the Northern District of Illinois , based on the claim construction from Virginia , denied the preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Both cases arrived at this court on appeal . This court heard the cases together and decides them together with this decision . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬507 patent has five claims , all of which Abbott asserts against Lupin as well as Sandoz and Teva . Claim 1 claims crystalline cefdinir , using its chemical name , and defining its unique characteristics with powder X-ray diffraction ( PXRD ) angle peaks : _NEWLINE_ 1 . Crystalline 7- [ 2- ( 2-a minothiazol-4-yl ) -2-hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl-3-cephem.-4-carboxylic acid ( syn isomer ) which shows the peaks at the diffraction angles shown in the following table in its powder X-ray diffraction pattern : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ diffraction angle ( ¢X ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 14.7¢X _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 17.8¢X _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 21.5¢X _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 22.0¢X _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 23.4¢X _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 24.5¢X _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ about 28.1¢X _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ¡¬507 patent , col.16 ll.13-27 . In contrast , claims 2-5 claim crystalline cefdinir , without any PXRD peak limitations , but with descriptions of processes used to obtain the crystalline cefdinir . Claims 2 and 5 are independent : _NEWLINE_ 2 . Crystalline 7- [ 2- ( 2-a minothiazol-4-yl ) -2-hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid ( syn isomer ) which is obtainable by acidifying a solution containing 7- [ 2- ( 2-aminothiazol-4-yl ) -2-hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl -3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid ( syn isomer ) at room temperature or under warming . _NEWLINE_ 5 . Crystalline 7- [ 2- ( 2-aminothiazol-4-yl ) -2-hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl -3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid ( syn isomer ) which is obtainable by dissolving 7- [ 2- ( 2-aminothiazol-4-yl ) -2 -hydroxyiminoacetamido ] -3-vinyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid ( syn isomer ) in an alcohol , continuing to stir the solution slowly under warming , then cooling the solution to room temperature and allowing the solution to stand . _NEWLINE_ Id . at col. 16 ll.29-34 , 43-50 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These claims use PXRD as a way to claim the structure and characteristics of the unique crystalline form . PXRD is a method for identifying and distinguishing different crystalline compounds . The method beams X-rays toward a powdered chemical . The method then measures the ways the rays reflect or bend upon contact with the chemical . The diffraction angles *1287 and intensities vary with the type and purity of the test compound . A graph then plots the diffraction angle on one axis and the intensity on another . These graphs yield a unique `` fingerprint '' for each crystalline form of a chemical . A more sensitive form of X-ray diffraction is single crystal X-ray diffraction ( SCXRD ) . As this name suggests , this method uses only a single crystal as a sample . SCXRD does not detect intensity , but produces a more precise diffraction angle measurement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬507 patent was not the first cefdinir patent . Rather , Astellas ' prior art U.S. Patent No . 4,559,334 ( the ¡¬334 patent ) describes the discovery of cefdinir as a compound demonstrating high antimicrobial activity . ¡¬334 patent , col. 11 ll.18-24 . The ¡¬334 patent expired on May 6 , 2007 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬507 patent claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No . 62-206199 ( the JP ¡¬199 application ) , which claimed two crystalline forms of cefdinir , `` Crystal A '' and `` Crystal B . '' The JP ¡¬199 application claimed Crystals A and B very specifically , defining Crystal A by three infrared ( IR ) -absorption wavelengths and sixteen PXRD angles and intensities . In contrast , Crystal B featured five IR-absorption wavelengths and twenty-one PXRD angles/intensities . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Despite using the JP ¡¬199 application for priority , the ¡¬507 patent 's specification differs significantly . Specifically , Abbott ( actually Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , Astellas ' predecessor in interest ) jettisoned the Crystal B disclosure found in the JP ¡¬199 application and crafted broader claims in its prosecution of the ¡¬507 patent . Because the JP ¡¬199 applications defines Crystal A and Crystal B physiochemically rather than structurally , the forms actually represent subgenuses of crystalline cefdinir . Thus Crystals A and B comprise crystalline forms of varying structures , which in the context of this case means varying levels of hydration . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Eastern District of Virginia construed the claim terms `` crystalline , '' `` shows , '' `` peaks , '' and `` about '' as follows : _NEWLINE_ 1 ) `` crystalline '' means `` Crystal A as outlined in the specification '' ; _NEWLINE_ 2 ) `` shows '' requires the display of a powder X-ray diffraction pattern which demonstrates the existence of the relevant peaks to a scientifically acceptable degree of certainty either visually or by other appropriate means of data display ; _NEWLINE_ 3 ) `` peaks '' is the plural of `` peak ; '' a `` peak exists at a powder X-ray diffraction angle that corresponds to an intensity measurement greater than measurements attributable to `` noise '' if that angle is immediately preceded by and followed by powder X-ray diffraction angle with a lower intensity measurement ; `` noise '' refers to those portions of a PXRD pattern produced by intrinsic measurement error , and which can not be associated with a scientifically significant quantity of the material which is the subject of the PXRD test ; _NEWLINE_ 4 ) `` about '' encompasses measurement errors inherently associated with powder X-ray diffraction testing . _NEWLINE_ Lupin CC Order , 484 F.Supp.2d at 459 , 466 . The Eastern District of Virginia also concluded that claims 2-5 were product-by-process claims . Id . Later the district court concluded that the process terms of claims 2-5 , indicated by the phrase `` obtainable by , '' limit the claims to the specified processes and process steps . In reaching that conclusion , the trial court followed this court 's opinion in Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp. , 970 F.2d 834 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) . Lupin SJ Order , 491 F.Supp.2d at 567-68 ; Lupin Ltd. v. Abbott Labs. , No . 3:06-CV-400 ( E.D.Va . May 10 , 2007 ) ( Lupin PbyP Order ) . In the Lupin appeal , Abbott challenges only *1288 the Eastern District of Virginia 's constructions of `` crystalline '' and `` obtainable by . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ Evaluation of a summary judgment of noninfringement requires two steps : claim construction , which this court reviews without deference , Cybor Corp. v. FAS Technologies , Inc. , 138 F.3d 1448 , 1451 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( en banc ) , and comparison of the properly construed claims to the accused product , process , or composition of matter , which in the context of summary judgment also occurs without deference , see Ormco Corp. v. Align Technology , Inc. , 498 F.3d 1307 , 1312 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . Although infringement by equivalency is a question of fact , this court may affirm summary judgment `` where no reasonable fact finder could find equivalence . '' Sage Prods. , Inc. v. Devon Indus. , Inc. , 126 F.3d 1420 , 1423 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( citing Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co. , 520 U.S. 17 , 39 n. 8 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 , 137 L.Ed.2d 146 ( 1997 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Claim Construction _NEWLINE_ Because the claims define the patent right , see Innova/Pure Water , Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Systems , Inc. , 381 F.3d 1111 , 1115 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) , naturally `` the claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms . '' Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1314 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( en banc ) . But the claims `` must be read in view of the specification , of which they are a part . '' Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc. , 52 F.3d 967 , 979 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( en banc ) , aff 'd , 517 U.S. 370 , 116 S.Ct . 1384 , 134 L.Ed.2d 577 ( 1996 ) . A patent 's specification provides necessary context for understanding the claims , and `` is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . '' Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1315 ( quoting Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576 , 1582 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ) . While equally true in a general sense , sometimes the specification offers practically incontrovertible directions about claim meaning . For example , inventors may act as their own lexicographers and give a specialized definition of claim terms . See id . at 1316 . Likewise , inventors and applicants may intentionally disclaim , or disavow , subject matter that would otherwise fall within the scope of the claim . See id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When consulting the specification to clarify the meaning of claim terms , courts must take care not to import limitations into the claims from the specification . This court has recognized the `` fine line between '' the encouraged and the prohibited use of the specification . Comark Commc'ns , Inc. v. Harris Corp. , 156 F.3d 1182 , 1186 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . When the specification describes a single embodiment to enable the invention , this court will not limit broader claim language to that single application `` unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using 'words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction . ' `` Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad , Inc. , 358 F.3d 898 , 906 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ( quoting Teleflex , Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am . Corp. , 299 F.3d 1313 , 1327 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ) . By the same token , the claims can not `` enlarge what is patented beyond what the inventor has described as the invention . '' Biogen , Inc. v. Berlex Labs. , Inc. , 318 F.3d 1132 , 1140 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( quoting Netword , LLC v. Centraal Corp. , 242 F.3d 1347 , 1352 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ) . Thus this court may reach a narrower construction , limited to the embodiment ( s ) disclosed in the specification , when the claims themselves , the specification , or the prosecution history clearly indicate that the invention encompasses no more than that confined structure or method . See Liebel-Flarsheim , 358 F.3d at 908 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Along with the specification , the prosecution history is `` intrinsic evidence '' *1289 of the meaning of the claims , because it `` provides evidence of how the [ United States Patent & Trademark Office ( PTO ) ] and the inventor understood the patent . '' Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317 . Although often producing ambiguities occasioned by ongoing negotiations between the inventor and the PTO , `` the prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution , making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be . '' Id . `` [ C ] lear and unmistakable '' statements during prosecution may also disavow claim scope . Computer Docking Station Corp. v. Dell , Inc. , 519 F.3d 1366 , 1374 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( quoting Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Endo Pharms. , Inc. , 438 F.3d 1123 , 1136 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ) . Again owing in part to the inherent ambiguities of prosecution history , the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer only applies to unambiguous disavowals . See id . at 1375 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . `` crystalline '' _NEWLINE_ The Eastern District of Virginia 's construction of `` crystalline '' in claims 1-5 as `` Crystal A '' included the important caveat `` as outlined in the specification . '' Lupin CC Order , 484 F.Supp.2d at 459 . Although the Eastern District noted the parties agreed that `` crystalline '' ordinarily means exhibiting `` uniformly arranged molecules or atoms , '' id . at 454 , the court relied on the language of the claims themselves , the specification , and the prosecution history to arrive at the more specific meaning recited in the specification . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬507 specification states that `` Crystal A of the compound ( I ) [ cefdinir ] shows its distinguishing peaks '' at the seven particular PXRD angles enumerated in claim 1 . ¡¬507 patent col.1 ll.51-62 . Indeed , the phrase `` Crystal A of the compound ( I ) '' appears throughout the written description , and the patent offers the following definition : `` any crystal of the compound ( I ) which shows substantially the same diffraction pattern [ as in the table in col.1/claim 1 ] is identified as Crystal A of the compound ( I ) . '' Id . at col.1 l.67-col.2 l.2 . As the Eastern District correctly concluded : _NEWLINE_ Had Astellas intended , in the chart found in column 1 , to distinguish Crystal A from other forms of crystalline cefdinir that also fall within the scope of claim 1 , it would have listed , at a minimum , an eighth peak associated only with Crystal A . However , by listing in column 1 only the same seven 'distinguishing ' peaks featured in Claim 1 , Astellas confirmed that Crystal A was synonymous with the invention listed in Claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ Lupin CC Order , 484 F.Supp.2d at 456-57 . The problem , within the confines of claim 1 , is that defining `` crystalline '' as `` Crystal A , '' where `` Crystal A '' incorporates the seven PXRD peak limitations , arguably renders the remainder of that claim redundant . To distinguish the invention , however , the specification refers several times to `` Crystal A of the compound ( I ) of the present invention , '' see , e.g. , ¡¬507 patent , col.2 ll.15-17 , and offers no suggestion that the recited processes could produce non-Crystal A compounds , even though other types of cefdinir crystals , namely Crystal B , were known in the art . As noted earlier , the Crystal B formulation actually appears in the parent JP ¡¬199 application . Thus , Abbott knew exactly how to describe and claim Crystal B compounds . Knowing of Crystal B , however , Abbott chose to claim only the A form in the ¡¬507 patent . Thus , the trial court properly limited the term `` crystalline '' to `` Crystal A . '' The trial court 's definition correctly identifies claim 1 's literal scope . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1290 Unlike claim 1 , claims 2-5 do not recite the seven PXRD peaks expressly associated with Crystal A in the ¡¬507 specification . Nonetheless , the Eastern District of Virginia limited `` crystalline '' to `` Crystal A '' in these claims as well , The trial court gave two reasons for this limitation . First , `` [ t ] he process steps detailed in those claims [ claims 2-5 ] correspond with the processes for making Crystal A disclosed in the specification under the heading 'The Process For Preparing Crystal A of The Compound ( I ) . ' `` Id . at 457 ( quoting ¡¬507 patent , col.2 ll.13-14 ) . Second , the parent JP ¡¬199 application recited these steps `` to distinguish between preparations of Crystal A and Crystal B . '' Id . ( citing JP ¡¬199 application , col.6 ll.1-25 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In limiting `` crystalline '' to `` Crystal A '' in claims 1-5 , the Eastern District of Virginia did not improperly import the preferred embodiment into the claims . Initially , Crystal A is the only embodiment described in the specification . As discussed above , the specification 's recitation of Crystal A as its sole embodiment does not alone justify the trial court 's limitation of claim scope to that single disclosed embodiment . See Liebel-Flarsheim , 358 F.3d at 906 ( `` [ T ] his court has expressly rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a single embodiment , the claims of the patent must be construed as being limited to that embodiment. '' ) . In this case , however , the rest of the intrinsic evidence , including the prosecution history and the priority JP ¡¬199 application , evince a clear intention to limit the ¡¬507 patent to Crystal A as defined by the seven PXRD peaks in the specification and in claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Initially , the Eastern District of Virginia properly considered the JP ¡¬199 application as relevant objective evidence of the inventor 's knowledge at the filing of the ¡¬507 patent . While statements made during prosecution of a foreign counterpart to a U.S. patent application have a narrow application to U.S. claim construction , Pfizer Inc. v. Ranbaxy Labs . Ltd. , 457 F.3d 1284 , 1290 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) , in this case the JP ¡¬199 application is part of the prosecution history of the ¡¬507 patent itself . Indeed the ¡¬507 patent claims priority from the JP ¡¬199 application . Furthermore , the trial court did not rely on attorney argument or amendments during a foreign prosecution as in Pfizer , but consulted only the contents of the foreign priority application . The JP ¡¬199 application strongly suggests that the ¡¬507 patent intentionally excluded Crystal B compounds . As discussed above , the JP ¡¬199 application establishes unequivocally that Abbott knew and could describe both Crystal A and Crystal B. Abbott could have retained the disclosure of Crystal B to support the broader claims of the ¡¬507 patent , but instead disclosed and claimed A alone . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , the prosecution history of the ¡¬507 patent shows a clear and intentional disavowal of claim scope beyond Crystal A. Co-inventor Takao Takaya , who prepared samples according to Examples 14 and 16 of the prior art ¡¬ 334 patent and a sample of `` Crystal A of the present application , '' offered a declaration that Crystal A was more stable than the prior art samples from the ¡¬334 patent . An analytical chemist , Yoshihiko Okamato , corroborated this evidence . J.A . 501-04 . Beyond these declarations , the applicant specifically limited the invention to Crystal A : `` the method of preparation of the crystalline form of the presently claimed compounds is not considered the heart of the present invention . The crystalline form of the compound represents the inventive concept hereof , and it is clear that [ the ¡¬ 334 patent ] does not anticipate or suggest said crystalline form . '' J.A . 511 ( Response to Office Action of May 11 , 1989 , received October 27 , 1989 , at 6 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1291 Given the exclusive focus on Crystal A in the specification as well as the prosecution history of the ¡¬507 patent , the Eastern District of Virginia properly limited `` crystalline '' in claims 1-5 to `` Crystal A . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2. proper interpretation of product-by process claims1 _NEWLINE_ This court addresses Part III.A.2 of this opinion en banc , which addresses the proper interpretation of product-by-process claims in determining infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claims 2-5 of the ¡¬507 patent begin by reciting a product , crystalline cefdinir , and then recite a series of steps by which this product is `` obtainable . '' The Eastern District of Virginia correctly categorized claims 2-5 as product-by-process claims . On appeal , Abbott argues that the Eastern District erred in construing the process steps of claims 2-5 under the rule in Atlantic Thermoplastics , 970 F.2d at 846-47 , that `` process terms in product-by-process claims serve as limitations in determining infringement , '' rather than in accordance with Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation v. Genentech , Inc. , 927 F.2d 1565 , 1583 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( `` [ T ] he correct reading of product-by-process claims is that they are not limited to product prepared by the process set forth in the claims. '' ) . This court takes this opportunity to clarify en banc the scope of product-by-process claims by adopting the rule in Atlantic Thermoplastics . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Atlantic Thermoplastics , this court considered the scope of product-by-process claim 26 in the patent at issue : `` [ t ] he molded innersole produced by the method of claim 1 . '' 970 F.2d at 836 . The patentee urged that competing , indistinguishable innersoles made by a different method nonetheless infringed claim 26 . Id . at 838 . This court rejected the patentee 's position . This court in Atlantic Thermoplastics construed product-by-process claims as limited by the process . Id . at 846-47 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This rule finds extensive support in Supreme Court opinions that have addressed the proper reading of product-by-process claims . See Smith v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. , 93 U.S. 486 , 493 , 23 L.Ed . 952 ( 1877 ) ( `` The process detailed is thereby made as much a part of the invention as are the materials of which the product is composed . `` ) ; Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis , 102 U.S. 222 , 224 , 26 L.Ed . 149 ( 1880 ) ( `` [ T ] o constitute infringement of the patent , both the material of which the dental plate is made ... and the process of constructing the plate ... must be employed . `` ) ; Merrill v. Yeomans , 94 U.S. 568 , 24 L.Ed . 235 ( 1877 ) ; Cochrane v. Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik , 111 U.S. 293 , 4 S.Ct . 455 , 28 L.Ed . 433 ( 1884 ) ( BASF ) ; The Wood-Paper Patent , 23 Wall . 566 , 90 U.S. 566 , 596 , 23 L.Ed . 31 ( 1874 ) ; Plummer v. Sargent , 120 U.S. 442 , 7 S.Ct . 640 , 30 L.Ed . 737 ( 1887 ) ; Gen. Elec . Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp. , 304 U.S. 364 , 58 S.Ct . 899 , 82 L.Ed . 1402 ( 1938 ) ; see also Atl . Thermoplastics , 970 F.2d at 839-42 ( discussing each of these cases ) . In these cases , the Supreme Court consistently noted that process terms that define the product in a product-by-process claim serve as enforceable limitations . In addition , the binding case law of this court 's predecessor courts , the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals ( see In re Hughes , 496 F.2d 1216 , 1219 ( CCPA 1974 ) ( acknowledging that `` true product claims '' are `` broader '' in scope than product-by-process claims ) ) , *1292 and the United States Court of Claims ( see Tri-Wall Containers v. United States , 187 Ct.Cl . 326 , 408 F.2d 748 , 751 ( 1969 ) ) , followed the same rule . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court 's sister circuits also followed the general rule that the defining process terms limit product-by-process claims . See , e.g. , Hide-Ite Leather v. Fiber Prods. , 226 F. 34 , 36 ( 1st Cir.1915 ) ( `` It is also a well-recognized rule that , although a product has definite characteristics by which it may be identified apart from the process , still , if in a claim for the product it is not so described , but is set forth in the terms of the process , nothing can be held to infringe the claim which is not made by the process . `` ) ; Paeco , Inc. v. Applied Moldings , Inc. , 562 F.2d 870 , 876 ( 3d Cir.1977 ) ( `` A patent granted on a product claim describing one process grants no monopoly as to identical products manufactured by a different process. '' ) . Indeed , this court itself had articulated that rule : `` For this reason , even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process , determination of patentability is based on the product itself . '' In re Thorpe , 777 F.2d 695 , 697 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Supreme Court has long emphasized the limiting requirement of process steps in product-by-process claims . In BASF , the Court considered a patent relating to artificial alizarine . Specifically , the patent claimed `` [ a ] rtificial alizarine , produced from anthracine or its derivatives by either of the methods herein described , or by any other method which will produce a like result . '' 111 U.S. at 296 , 4 S.Ct . 455 ( quoting U.S. Patent Reissue No . RE 4,321 ) . In turn , the specification generally described a method for making artificial alizarine involving anthracine or its derivatives . Alizarine had been in use for thousands of years as a red textile dye , traditionally extracted from madder root . Pure alizarine has the chemical formula C14H8 O4 , but `` artificial alizarines '' available in the market at the time of the litigation varied from almost completely pure alizarine , to combinations of alizarine and anthrapurpurine , to pure purpurine containing no alizarine whatsoever . Id . at 309-10 , 4 S.Ct . 455 . The defendant 's product contained approximately sixty percent anthrapurpurine . Thus both alizarine and artificial alizarines were known in the prior art . The Supreme Court clearly articulated some of the scope and validity problems that arise when process limitations of product-by-process claims are ignored : _NEWLINE_ [ The defendant 's product ] is claimed by the plaintiff to be the artificial alizarine described in No . 4,321 , and to be physically , chemically , and in coloring properties similar to that . But what that is is not defined in No . 4,321 , except that it is the product of the process described in No . 4,321 . Therefore , unless it is shown that the process of No . 4,321 was followed to produce the defendant 's article , or unless it is shown that that article could not be produced by any other process , the defendant 's article can not be identified as the product of the process of No . 4,321 . Nothing of the kind is shown . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * _NEWLINE_ If the words of the claim are to be construed to cover all artificial alizarine , whatever its ingredients , produced from anthracine or its derivatives by methods invented since Graebe and Liebermann invented the bromine process , we then have a patent for a product or composition of matter which gives no information as to how it is to be identified . Every patent for a product or composition of matter must identify it so that it can be recognized aside from the description of the process for making it , or else nothing can be held to infringe the *1293 patent which is not made by that process . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 310 , 4 S.Ct . 455 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After BASF , the Supreme Court continued to emphasize the importance of process steps in evaluating the infringement of product-by-process claims . See , e.g. , Plummer , 120 U.S. at 448 , 7 S.Ct . 640 ( `` [ W ] hatever likeness that may appear between the product of the process described in the patent and the article made by the defendants , their identity is not established unless it is shown that they are made by the same process . `` ) ; Gen. Elec . Co. , 304 U.S. at 373 , 58 S.Ct . 899 ( `` [ A ] patentee who does not distinguish his product from what is old except by reference , express or constructive , to the process by which he produced it , can not secure a monopoly on the product by whatever means produced . '' ( footnote omitted ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , based on Supreme Court precedent and the treatment of product-by-process claims throughout the years by the PTO and other binding court decisions , this court now restates that `` process terms in product-by-process claims serve as limitations in determining infringement . '' Atl . Thermoplastics , 970 F.2d at 846-47 . As noted earlier , this holding follows this court 's clear statement in In re Thorpe that `` product by process claims are limited by and defined by the process . '' 777 F.2d at 697 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ More recently , the Supreme Court has reiterated the broad principle that `` [ e ] ach element contained in a patent claim is deemed material to defining the scope of the patented invention . '' Warner-Jenkinson , 520 U.S. at 19 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 . Although Warner-Jenkinson specifically addressed the doctrine of equivalents , this rule applies to claim construction overall . As applied to product-by-process claims , Warner-Jenkinson thus reinforces the basic rule that the process terms limit product-by-process claims . To the extent that Scripps Clinic is inconsistent with this rule , this court hereby expressly overrules Scripps Clinic . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dissenting opinions lament the loss of a `` right '' that has never existed in practice or precedent-the right to assert a product-by-process claim against a defendant who does not practice the express limitations of the claim . This court 's en banc decision in no way abridges an inventor 's right to stake claims in product-by-process terms . Instead this decision merely restates the rule that the defining limitations of a claim-in this case process terms-are also the terms that show infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus this court does not question at all whether product-by-process claims are legitimate as a matter of form . The legitimacy of this claim form was indeed a relevant issue in the nineteenth century when Ex parte Painter , 1891 C.D . 200 , 200-01 ( Comm ' r Pat . 1891 ) , and some later cases were before the Commissioner of Patents . However , this court need not address that settled issue . The issue here is only whether such a claim is infringed by products made by processes other than the one claimed . This court holds that it is not . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The jurisprudence of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals-a court with virtually no jurisdiction to address infringement litigation-can shed little light on the enforcement of the only claim limitations that an applicant chooses to define the invention . Indeed , this court 's venerable predecessor expressed its ambivalence towards the relevant infringement analysis : _NEWLINE_ The policy of the Patent Office in permitting product-by-process type claims to define a patentable product , where necessary , has developed with full cognizance of the fact that in infringement *1294 suits some courts have construed such claims as covering only a product made by the particular process set forth in the claim and not to the product per se . _NEWLINE_ In re Bridgeford , 53 C.C.P.A . 1182 , 357 F.2d 679 , 683 n. 5 ( 1966 ) . The reference to `` some courts '' in this prior citation , as this court notes en banc , includes the United States Supreme Court and every circuit court to consider the question , including this circuit . See also Jon S. Saxe & Julian S. Levitt , Product-by-Process Claims and Their Current Status in Chemical Patent Office Practice , 42 J. Pat . Off . Soc ' y 528 , 530 ( 1960 ) ( `` [ P ] roduct-by-process claims have met with a most strict interpretation in the courts in infringement proceedings ... . [ T ] he courts uniformly hold that only a product produced by the claim-designated process may be held to infringe the claim . '' ) ( citing Gen. Elec . Co. , 304 U.S. 364 , 58 S.Ct . 899 , 82 L.Ed . 1402 and BASF , 111 U.S. at 310 , 4 S.Ct . 455 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Product-by-process claims , especially for those rare situations when products were difficult or impossible to describe , historically presented a concern that the Patent Office might deny all product protection to such claims . See In re Butler , 17 C.C.P.A . 810 , 813 , 37 F.2d 623 ( 1930 ) ( `` Process claims are valuable , and appellant thinks he is entitled to them ; but it is submitted that he should not be limited to control of the process when the article which that process produces is new and useful. '' ) . In the modern context , however , if an inventor invents a product whose structure is either not fully known or too complex to analyze ( the subject of this case-a product defined by sophisticated PXRD technology-suggests that these concerns may no longer in reality exist ) , this court clarifies that the inventor is absolutely free to use process steps to define this product . The patent will issue subject to the ordinary requirements of patentability . The inventor will not be denied protection . Because the inventor chose to claim the product in terms of its process , however , that definition also governs the enforcement of the bounds of the patent right . This court can not simply ignore as verbiage the only definition supplied by the inventor . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court 's rule regarding the proper treatment of product-by-process claims in infringement litigation carries its own simple logic . Assume a hypothetical chemical compound defined by process terms . The inventor declines to state any structures or characteristics of this compound . The inventor of this compound obtains a product-by-process claim : `` Compound X , obtained by process Y . '' Enforcing this claim without reference to its defining terms would mean that an alleged infringer who produces compound X by process Z is still liable for infringement . But how would the courts ascertain that the alleged infringer 's compound is really the same as the patented compound ? After all , the patent holder has just informed the public and claimed the new product solely in terms of a single process . Furthermore , what analytical tools can confirm that the alleged infringer 's compound is in fact infringing , other than a comparison of the claimed and accused infringing processes ? If the basis of infringement is not the similarity of process , it can only be similarity of structure or characteristics , which the inventor has not disclosed . Why also would the courts deny others the right to freely practice process Z that may produce a better product in a better way ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In sum , it is both unnecessary and logically unsound to create a rule that the process limitations of a product-by-process claim should not be enforced in some exceptional instance when the structure of the claimed product is unknown and the product can be defined only by reference to a process by which it can be made . Such a rule would expand the protection of *1295 the patent beyond the subject matter that the inventor has `` particularly point [ ed ] out and distinctly claim [ ed ] '' as his invention , 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 ? 6 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , the Eastern District of Virginia correctly applied the rule that the recited process steps limit the product-by-process claims 2-5 for any infringement analysis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 . `` obtainable by '' _NEWLINE_ In this case , Abbott 's plain language argument , that `` obtainable by '' introduces an optional process , even if `` obtained by '' would introduce limiting process steps , is also unavailing . The BASF case , an analogous situation to this case , controls . As noted above , the Supreme Court in BASF considered the following claim language : `` Artificial alizarine , produced from anthracine or its derivatives by either of the methods herein described , or by any other method which will produce a like result . '' 111 U.S. at 296 , 4 S.Ct . 455 ( emphasis added ) . The patentee argued that even though the defendant did not make artificial alizarine by `` either of the methods herein described , '' the claim should capture the product because of the `` or by another method '' language . Id . at 309 , 4 S.Ct . 455 . The Supreme Court refused to attach importance to those expansive words : `` No . 4,321 furnishes no test by which to identify the product it covers , except that such product is to be the result of the process it describes . '' Id . at 305 , 4 S.Ct . 455 . Abbott 's claims 2-5 , like those in BASF and like product-by-process claims in general , do not furnish any test by which to identify the cefdinir crystals except that they are the result of their respectively claimed processes . As per BASF , Abbott 's claim can not capture a product obtained by or obtainable by processes other than those explicitly recited in the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ If this court were to strip the process elements from the claims , as Abbott would urge , for infringement purposes , there would then be nothing to differentiate independent claim 2 from independent claim 5 . After all , if those claims are not bound by the process terms but only `` define '' the basic cefdinir compound , then each of the claims recite the same thing , over and over again . Though Abbott argues that it merely intends to give meaning to the word `` obtainable , '' it instead seeks to have this court render meaningless the explicit process limitations that the applicant chose to define its invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The intrinsic evidence in this case further rebuts Abbott 's contention that its claims are not limited to those products actually obtained by the processes recited . In column 2 of the ¡¬507 patent , under the title heading `` The Process for Preparing Crystal A of the Compound ( I ) , '' the patentee used specific language to describe the very two processes that are mirrored in claims 2 and 5 . ¡¬507 patent col.2 ll.13-51 . This language is not open-ended , nor does it constitute a mere description of the product by reference to the manner in which it can be made , as Abbott argues . By drafting claims 2 and 5 to incorporate these specific processes , Abbott made a conscious choice to place process requirements on its claimed product . If Abbott had wanted to obtain broader coverage for crystalline cefdinir devoid of any process limitations , as it seeks to do here , it could have simply done so ( if indeed , as it argues , it is really the product that is the heart of the invention , not the process ) . But it did not . The crystals of claims 2 and 5 are simply not identifiable other than by the processes disclosed in column 2 . This court must enforce the ways and terms that a party chooses to define its invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1296 The prosecution history also does not support Abbott 's contention that `` obtainable by '' offers merely an optional set of definitional process conditions . During prosecution , Abbott faced obviousness rejections based on application claims 6-9 , which were process claims that mirrored the very process limitations of issued claims 2-5 . The PTO refused to issue the claims until one set of duplicates was cancelled . Abbott 's action in cancelling claims 6-9 demonstrates its acquiescence to the PTO 's view that the process elements of claims 2-5 are critical parts of those claims . In addition , in a response to the PTO 's office action , Abbott chose to differentiate a cited ¡± 103 reference , Takaya , on the basis that Abbott 's claimed processes are different . For these reasons , the applicant 's statement in the file wrapper that `` the method of preparation ... is not considered the heart of the present invention '' should not be afforded undue gravitas . The process limitations can not be haphazardly jettisoned for an infringement analysis when they were so important in the patentability analysis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In sum , a patentee 's use of the word `` obtainable '' rather than `` obtained by '' can not give it a free pass to escape the ambit of the product-by-process claiming doctrine . Claims that include such ambiguous language should be viewed extremely narrowly . If this court does not require , as a precondition for infringement , that an accused infringer actually use a recited process , simply because of the patentee 's choice of the probabilistic suffix `` able , '' the very recitation of that process becomes redundant . This would widen the scope of the patentee 's claims beyond that which is actually invented-a windfall to the inventor at the expense of future innovation and proper notice to the public of the scope of the claimed invention . For all the above reasons , the Eastern District of Virginia correctly construed the process limitations beginning with `` obtainable by '' in claims 2-5 as limiting the asserted claims to products made by those process steps . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Summary Judgment _NEWLINE_ In the Lupin case , the Eastern District of Virginia granted summary judgment of noninfringement of claims 2-5 , both literal and by equivalents , and of claim 1 by equivalents . Lupin SJ Order . Literal infringement of claim 1 , i.e. , whether Lupin 's generic cefdinir product contains any Crystal A , is therefore not a live issue on appeal . As for claims 2-5 , the Eastern District noted that `` Abbott and Astellas have conceded that literal infringement of Claims 2-5 can not be established if the product-by-process analysis is performed pursuant to Atlantic Thermoplastics , '' given that `` Abbott and Astellas have presented no evidence that Lupin is practicing the process steps set forth in Claims 2-5 . '' Lupin SJ Order , 491 F.Supp.2d at 568 . Because the Eastern District correctly applied the rule from Atlantic Thermoplastics and likewise properly construed the limiting process terms in claims 2-5 , only infringement by equivalents of claims 1-5 remains before this court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Infringement analysis under the doctrine of equivalents proceeds element-by-element ; a generalized showing of equivalency between the claim as a whole and the allegedly infringing product or process is not sufficient to show infringement . See Warner-Jenkinson , 520 U.S. at 29 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 ( `` the doctrine of equivalents must be applied to individual elements of the claim , not to the invention as a whole '' ) . The primary test for equivalency is the `` function-way-result '' or `` triple identity '' test , whereby the patentee may show an equivalent when the accused product or process performs substantially the same function , in substantially the same way , to achieve substantially the same result , as disclosed in the claim . *1297 Graver Tank & Mfg . Co. v. Linde Air Prods . Co. , 339 U.S. 605 , 608 , 70 S.Ct . 854 , 94 L.Ed . 1097 ( 1950 ) . But , because `` [ d ] ifferent linguistic frameworks may be more suitable to different cases , '' Warner-Jenkinson , 520 U.S. at 40 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 , the function-way-result test is not the only test for equivalency . Equivalency may also be proven where the differences between the invention as claimed and the accused product or process are insubstantial . Hilton Davis Chem . Co. v. Warner-Jenkinson Co. , 62 F.3d 1512 , 1517-18 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( en banc ) , rev 'd on other grounds , 520 U.S. 17 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 , 137 L.Ed.2d 146 ( 1997 ) . In no case , however , may the doctrine of equivalents ignore the individual claim elements . See Warner-Jenkinson , 520 U.S. at 40 , 117 S.Ct . 1040 ( requiring `` a special vigilance against allowing the concept of equivalence to eliminate completely any such [ individual ] elements '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because `` crystalline '' in claims 1-5 is limited to `` Crystal A '' as defined by the seven PXRD peaks enumerated in claim 1 and in the specification of the ¡¬ 507 patent , the doctrine of equivalents can not capture crystals that are not themselves equivalent to Crystal A . In turn , the bounds of Crystal A equivalents can not ignore the limits on Crystal A in the ¡¬507 patent , which as discussed above , includes a conscious decision to distinguish Crystal B from the claimed invention . To recall , the applicant removed Crystal B from the U.S. prosecution of the parent JP ¡¬199 application . The ¡¬507 patent indisputably describes and claims Crystal A , and not Crystal B . The ¡¬507 patent , of course , could have claimed the known Crystal B formulation which was known to the inventors because it appeared in their priority JP ¡¬199 application . The applicants chose not to claim Crystal B . Thus Crystal B compounds , most relevantly cefdinir monohydrate , fall outside the scope , literal or equivalent , of claims 1-5 of the ¡¬507 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The parties agree that the `` bulk '' of Lupin 's cefdinir product is Crystal B , not Crystal A . The degree to which Lupin 's product may or may not also contain Crystal A is the central inquiry regarding the alleged literal infringement of claim 1 , which is not part of the present appeal . Abbott can not extend its exclusive right in the ¡¬507 claims under the doctrine of equivalents to embrace known but unclaimed subject matter . In other words , Abbott effectively disclaimed Crystal B during prosecution of the ¡¬507 patent , by removing the Crystal B disclosure from the parent JP ¡¬199 application and emphasizing the sole teaching of Crystal A in communications with the PTO as well as in the ¡¬507 specification itself . Abbott can not now recapture that unclaimed subject matter under the doctrine of equivalents because the Eastern District properly interpreted claims 2-5 to limit `` crystalline '' to Crystal A . To expand that claim term to embrace Crystal B would ignore the specific claim limitations of the ¡¬507 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Alternatively this court notes that this case seems to fit within the dedication doctrine that forecloses invocation of the doctrine of equivalents . The patent applicant clearly knew of the Crystal B forms of the claimed invention because it claimed and disclosed them in its Japanese priority application . Yet it declined to claim an embodiment expressly disclosed in its priority document , thus dedicating that embodiment to the public and foreclosing any recapture under the doctrine of equivalents . See Johnson & Johnston Assocs . v. R.E . Serv . Co. , 285 F.3d 1046 , 1054 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ During prosecution , Abbott chose to eschew Crystal B and focus exclusively on Crystal A compounds . Without a complete record and no arguments about validity before this court on appeal , this court can not speculate on the reasons for this *1298 choice . Nonetheless , the parties hotly contest whether Example 14 , which reports obtaining `` crystals '' not specifically identified or described , and/or Example 16 of the ¡¬334 patent enable cefdinir monohydrate , i.e . Crystal B type crystals . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Beyond the attempt to reinflate the claims to encompass Crystal B based on mathematical comparisons of the PXRD peak patterns of Crystal A and Crystal B , Abbott also asserts that Lupin effectively admitted infringement by equivalents when it claimed before the Food and Drug Administration that its cefdinir generic was a bioequivalent to Abbott 's Omnicef product . While bioequivalency may be relevant to the function prong of the function-way-result test , bioequivalency and equivalent infringement are different inquiries . Bioequivalency is a regulatory and medical concern aimed at establishing that two compounds are effectively the same for pharmaceutical purposes . In contrast , equivalency for purposes of patent infringement requires an element-by-element comparison of the patent claim and the accused product , requiring not only equivalent function but also equivalent way and result . Different attributes of a given product may thus be relevant to bioequivalency but not equivalent infringement , and vice versa . As the Northern District of Illinois observed in the Sandoz case , `` [ i ] f bioequivalency meant per se infringement , no alternative to a patented medicine could ever be offered to the public during the life of a patent . '' Sandoz PI Order , 486 F.Supp.2d at 776 . Thus , while potentially relevant , the bioequivalency of an accused product with a product produced from the patent at issue is not sufficient to establish infringement by equivalents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because Crystal B is not an equivalent of Crystal A , the Eastern District of Virginia did not err in granting summary judgment of noninfringement of claims 2-5 , both with respect to literal and equivalent infringement , and with respect to equivalent infringement of claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . _NEWLINE_ This court reviews the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion . Amazon.com , Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1343 , 1350 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . A district court may enter a preliminary injunction based on its consideration of four factors : `` ( 1 ) the likelihood of the patentee 's success on the merits ; ( 2 ) irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted ; ( 3 ) the balance of hardships between the parties ; and ( 4 ) the public interest . '' Erico Int ' l Corp. v. Vutec Corp. , 516 F.3d 1350 , 1353-54 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( quoting PHG Techs. , LLC v. St. John Cos. , Inc. , 469 F.3d 1361 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sandoz and Teva 's Omnicef generic products , like Lupin 's , are also at least primarily cefdinir monohydrate , a Crystal B compound . Sandoz PI Order , 486 F.Supp.2d at 769 . Before the Northern District of Illinois , the parties to the Sandoz litigation disputed whether Sandoz and Teva 's products also contained small amounts of cefdinir anhydrate , i.e. , Crystal A , which would fall within the literal scope of claim 1 of the ¡¬507 patent . Working primarily from the Eastern District of Virginia 's claim construction , to which the parties to the Sandoz litigation agreed would bind their litigation as well for purposes of the preliminary injunction motion , the Northern District of Illinois denied Abbott 's motion for a preliminary injunction , finding that Abbott was unlikely to prevail on the merits at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court detects no abuse of discretion in the Northern District of Illinois ' preliminary injunction denial . As described above , the ¡¬507 patent is properly construed to exclude Crystal B , both as to *1299 literal and equivalent infringement . Thus , this court need not delve into the Northern District of Illinois ' clarifications of the Eastern District of Virginia 's claim constructions . The Northern District of Illinois succinctly concluded : `` [ w ] e know that Crystal B was known to the plaintiffs because it had been included in the Japanese ¡¬199 patent . Thus we conclude that the plaintiffs deliberately excluded from the definition of Crystal A , cefdinir monohydrate , which is Crystal B . '' Id . at 775 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As to the alleged presence of small amounts of Crystal A in Sandoz and Teva 's products , Abbott 's evidence did not persuade the Northern District of Illinois . Id . This court perceives that decision as well within the trial court 's discretion . As additional support , the Northern District observed that there was no evidence that any trace amounts of cefdinir anhydrate , i.e . Crystal A , in Sandoz and Teva 's products `` could be a contributing factor in the efficacy '' and that even `` if there is a small amount of cefdinir anhydrate in defendants ' products , we do not conclude that this could cause literal infringement . '' Id . While these may be misstatements of the law , because de minimis infringement can still be infringement , see 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( a ) ; see also SunTiger , Inc. v. Sci . Res . Funding Group , 189 F.3d 1327 , 1336 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( `` If a claim reads merely on a part of an accused device , that is enough for infringement . `` ) , this court need not reach that issue in a preliminary injunction context which affords the trial court broad leeway to discern a `` likelihood of success . '' Likewise the district court may have overstated the relevance of efficacy , because the ¡¬507 patent contains no claim limitations relating to efficacy . But these misstatements were harmless because they merely formed an alternative basis for the Northern District of Illinois ' reasonable assessment of the evidence proffered by Abbott for its preliminary injunction motion . As noted , this court sustains the trial court 's discretion based primarily on its administration of the proper claim construction and its finding that Abbott was not likely to show Sandoz and Teva 's products contained any Crystal A at all . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The Eastern District of Virginia correctly construed the ¡¬507 patent 's recitation of `` crystalline '' in each of the asserted claims as limited to Crystal A , as outlined in the specification . Because Abbott scrubbed all references to Crystal B in the ¡¬507 patent 's specification , which were present in the ¡¬507 patent 's parent foreign application , Abbott clearly demonstrated its intent to limit the ¡¬507 patent to Crystal A . This intent was further underscored by comments made during prosecution . As such , Abbott is unable to recapture Crystal B through broad claim language or under the doctrine of equivalents . The Eastern District of Virginia therefore properly concluded on summary judgment that Lupin 's cefdinir product did not infringe claims 1-5 literally or claims 2-5 by equivalency . Similarly , the Northern District of Illinois did not abuse its discretion in declining to enter a preliminary injunction against Sandoz and Teva 's cefdinir products . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ Each party shall bear its own costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ NEWMAN , Circuit Judge , with whom Circuit Judges MAYER and LOURIE join , dissenting from en banc Section III.A.2 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court today acts en banc to overturn a century of precedent and practice , and holds that a new product that is difficult to describe without reference to how it was made , but that is nonetheless a new and unobvious product , can not be protected as *1300 a product if its description is aided by reference to how it was made . Heretofore a new product whose structure was not fully known or not readily described could be patented as a product by including in the product description sufficient reference to how it can be made , to distinguish the new product from prior art products . Patentability was determined as a product , independent of any process reference in the claim , and validity and infringement were based on the product itself . This expedient for patenting products whose structure was not fully known at the time of filing the patent application has been called the `` rule of necessity . '' It was pragmatic , fair , and just , for it attuned patent law and practice to the realities of invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Today the court rejects this expedient and discards this practice , ruling that all claims containing a process term under the rule of necessity now must be construed , for purposes of infringement , as limited to use of any process term that was used to assist in defining the product . That is , such a product is not patented as a product , however it is produced , but is limited to the process by which it was obtained . This is a new restraint on patents for new products , particularly today 's complex chemical and biological products whose structure may be difficult to analyze with precision . It is a change of law with unknown consequences for patent-based innovation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court acts sua sponte , without explanation of what policy is intended to be served by this change , without consideration of the technologies that may be adversely affected by elimination of this expedient , without notice to those whose property rights may be diminished . In so doing , the court departs from statute , precedent , and practice . This change is as unnecessary as it is flawed , gratuitously affecting inventions past , present , and future . I respectfully dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ For most product inventions , the process by which the product was made , whether or not the process is itself a patentable invention , is not stated in the product claims . However , as the variety and complexity of invention and technology have increased , various forms of product claims with process terms have been used in specific circumstances , depending on the nature of the invention.1 The form here at issue relates to product claims for new and unobvious products whose structure is not fully known , and for which process parameters are used to aid in defining the product . This claiming expedient has been recognized since at least 1891 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court today overturns this expedient for all circumstances , brooking no exception . Acting en banc for the purpose , the court rules that if any process term or descriptive aspect is included in a product claim to aid in distinguishing a new product , the claim can not be infringed by the identical product unless the same process aspect is used in making the accused product . The court holds that it is irrelevant whether the product is new or was known , irrelevant whether the product could have been fully described by its structure at the time of the patent application , irrelevant whether the particular invention is a new product or is actually a process . The court adopts a simplistic universal rule , *1301 thereby targeting a small but significant class of inventions . The effect of this decision on innovation in complex fields of science and technology is unknown to the court , for we have had no advice on the consequences of this change of law . My dissent is directed as much to the court 's procedure , as to the substance of the court 's decision . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ PROCEDURE _NEWLINE_ The court has given no notice of this impending en banc action , contrary to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and contrary to the Federal Circuit 's own operating procedures . The en banc court has received no briefing and held no argument , although the Federal Rules so require . The communities of inventors , innovators , and the public who may be affected by this change of law have had no opportunity to be heard . The court has received no information concerning the effect on patents that were granted based on this long-established practice , no advice on what kinds of inventions may now lie fallow because they are unprotected . Nor does the court explain its suspension of the standards of judicial process . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Federal Rules have the force of law . 28 U.S.C . ¡± 2072 . Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 34 and 35 are here implicated . Rule 34 provides that `` oral argument must be allowed in every case '' unless certain specific exceptions exist : _NEWLINE_ Rule 34 ( a ) ( 2 ) Standards . Oral argument must be allowed in every case unless a panel of three judges who have examined the briefs and record unanimously agrees that oral argument is unnecessary for any of the following reasons : _NEWLINE_ ( A ) the appeal is frivolous ; _NEWLINE_ ( B ) the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively decided ; or _NEWLINE_ ( C ) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record , and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument . _NEWLINE_ Applying the Rule 34 standards , it is clear that ( A ) this appeal is not frivolous and ( B ) the dispositive issue has not been authoritatively decided , for it is currently being addressed en banc . There has been ( C ) no briefing and no record to the court , and this is not a case in which the decisional process would not be aided by oral argument . The en banc court has heard no argument , and has received neither written nor oral exploration of the diverse aspects of this long-established claiming practice . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 35 has also failed of compliance . That rule recognizes the exceptional nature of en banc hearing or rehearing , and identifies the two circumstances warranting such procedure : _NEWLINE_ ¢F=BQP:0132Rule 35 ( a ) ... An en banc hearing or rehearing is not favored and ordinarily will not be ordered unless : _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) en banc consideration is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the court 's decisions ; or _NEWLINE_ ( 2 ) the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance . _NEWLINE_ When an en banc hearing or rehearing is ordered sua sponte by the court , whether for uniformity of decision or on a question of exceptional importance , the hearing or rehearing must receive the appellate process set by the Rules . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I agree that en banc review is appropriate , for this apparent conflict in our precedent has existed since 1992 . Now that the court has undertaken to resolve the conflict , the withholding of public notice , or even notice to the parties to this case , is devoid of justification . The question is of importance , but there has been no assertion *1302 of urgency sufficient to require bypassing the standard appellate procedures . The breadth of the en banc court 's ruling , the solidity of the precedent now overruled , the importance of the technologies affected , and the untold issued patents that are now placed in limbo , require this court 's compliance with Federal Rules 34 and 35 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Federal Circuit has recognized that it can benefit from the advice of those knowledgeable in the law and its purposes , in the areas of our nation-wide responsibility . Patent law has a direct impact on innovation , industry , and technological advance , and when an en banc ruling may change the law affecting some areas of technology and the industries based thereon , this court has routinely sought to be informed , by the parties and amici curiae , of relevant concerns . When the impact of a sua sponte change of law transcends the interests of the parties to the specific case , notice to the interested public , as well as to the parties , is fundamental to due and fair process . The Federal Circuit 's Internal Operating Procedure ( IOP ) 14 was adopted to implement these principles : _NEWLINE_ IOP 14.3 ( c ) If the sua sponte petition for hearing en banc is granted , a committee of judges appointed by the chief judge , which shall normally include the judge who initiated the poll , shall within seven working days ( fourteen working days between June 21 and September 11 ) transmit on a vote sheet to the judges who will sit en banc an order setting forth the questions proposed to be addressed by the court en banc . The clerk shall provide notice that a majority of the judges in regular service has acted under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 46 and Fed . R.App . P. 35 ( a ) to order the appeal to be heard en banc , and indicate any questions the court may wish the parties and amici to address . Notice shall be given that the court en banc shall consist of all circuit judges in regular service who are not recused or disqualified . Additional briefing and oral argument will be ordered as appropriate . _NEWLINE_ United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , Internal Operating Procedures at 40 , available at http : //www.cafc.uscourts.gov/pdf/IOPs 122006.pdf . This IOP has not been followed . No notice was given , even to the parties , that the court had ordered this question to be reheard en banc ; nor did the court advise the parties or the public as to the aspects being addressed for en banc decision . The court is acting sua sponte , without notice and without argument and without an opportunity for participation . By bypassing this court 's standard operating procedure , as well as violating the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure , the court has deprived itself of input concerning the experience of precedent , of advice as to how this change of law may affect future innovation , and of guidance as to the effect on existing property rights . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ PRECEDENT AND PRACTICE _NEWLINE_ The court 's opinion does not mention the long-established precedent that it is overturning . This is not a simple conflict between isolated rulings of the Federal Circuit ; it is a change of law and practice with roots in century-old decisions . I start with this precedent , for the expedient of what came to be called the `` rule of necessity '' originated in the recognition , by the courts and the Patent Office , that not all new products could be fully described by their structure , due to the state of scientific knowledge or available analytical techniques . It was also recognized , over a century ago , that sufficient distinction from prior art products could sometimes be achieved by reference to how the product was made . Thus the courts and patent administrators established the exception *1303 that permitted inclusion in a product claim of sufficient recitation of how the product was made , to aid in identifying the product and distinguishing it from the prior art . This claim form was loosely called a `` product-by-process '' form , although that term includes a variety of situations , see n. 1 supra , having diverse legal consequences . The only form here at issue is that in which the product is new and its structure is not fully or readily known , such that its definition as a product is aided by referring to how it was made . Since before 1891 , this has been an accepted way to claim products as products , recognizing that this is an exception to the general rule that new products are claimed without reference to the process by which they are produced . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This exception was discussed in 1891 in Ex parte Painter , the Commissioner of Patents explaining that when there is entitlement to a patent on a new article of manufacture , it can be claimed by reference to the process of producing it , when the inventor lacks other language to `` define and discriminate '' the invention : _NEWLINE_ It requires no argument to establish the proposition that as a rule a claim for an article of manufacture should not be defined by the process of producing that article . On the other hand , when a man has made an invention his right to a patent for it , or his right to a claim properly defining it , is not to be determined by the limitations of the English language . When the case arises that an article of manufacture is a new thing , a useful thing , and embodies invention , and that article can not be properly defined and discriminated from prior art otherwise than by reference to the process of producing it , a case is presented which constitutes an exception to the rule . _NEWLINE_ 1891 C.D . 200 , 200-01 ( Comm ' r Pat . 1891 ) . The Commissioner cited , as an earlier example of this exception , the claim in Globe Nail Co. v. U.S . Horse Nail Co. , 19 F. 819 ( C.C.D.Mass.1884 ) ( sustaining validity of claim directed to horse-shoe nail claimed by reference to its process of manufacture , and finding it infringed by the accused nail having only a `` trivial and unsubstantial variation '' from the claimed product ) . In contrast , where the patent application made clear that the product could be described by its structure , the Patent Office ruled that the exception did not apply . See , e.g. , Ex parte Scheckner , 1903 C.D . 315 , 315-16 ( Comm ' r Pat.1903 ) ( sustaining rejection of claim directed to an etched printing-plate that `` specifies certain steps by means of which the etching is accomplished '' because other claims `` define the plate in terms of its structure '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This expedient has been discussed in various judicial decisions . In all cases the issue has not been whether this expedient was available , for its availability was not challenged ; the issue was simply its application to the particular facts . For example , at a time when it heard direct appeals from Patent Office rulings , the D.C . Circuit remarked on this `` only exception '' to the general rule of product claiming , stating : _NEWLINE_ It is a well-settled rule of patent law that claims for a product which is defined by the process of producing it will not be allowed ; and the only exception to this rule seems to be in cases where the product involves invention and can not be defined except by the process used in its creation . In extreme cases of this character , the product may be allowed ; but that is not this case , especially in view of the broad claims allowed appellant in his copending application ... . _NEWLINE_ In re Brown , 29 F.2d 873 , 874 ( D.C.Cir.1928 ) ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals discussed precedent involving claims *1304 for processes and products in various factual situations , and summarized that : _NEWLINE_ Where it is possible to define a product by its characteristics , the practice is clearly settled that this should be done . Where , however , the product is novel and involves invention and can not be defined except by the steps of the process involved in its creation , there are cases holding that such a claim may be allowed , and it has been sustained by a Court . _NEWLINE_ In re Butler , 17 C.C.P.A . 810 , 37 F.2d 623 , 626 ( 1930 ) ( emphasis added ) ( quoting Ex Parte Feisenmeier , 1922 C.D . 18 ( Comm ' r Pat.1922 ) ) . The CCPA then found this rule inapplicable to the facts of Butler 's invention , explaining that `` the record at bar does not meet this requirement [ that the product was new ] . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In In re Lifton , 38 C.C.P.A . 1119 , 189 F.2d 261 ( 1951 ) , the CCPA again commented on this exception for product claims , stating that when `` proper article claims '' were possible they must be used , with the exception of when such claims are `` impossible '' : _NEWLINE_ This court has uniformly held that a claim for an article must define the article by its structure and not by the process of making it . The one exception to this rule , where the invention is the article and it is impossible to otherwise define it , is clearly ruled out in the present case because appellant has demonstrated the possibility of proper article claims by including several devoid of process limitations . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 263 ( emphasis added , citations omitted ) . The court again recognized `` the one exception , '' holding once again that it does not apply when the product can be described independently of the process of making it . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These inquiries into the facts warranting application of the exception demonstrate that the rule of necessity was seldom applied , but was nonetheless recognized both by the courts and the Patent Office . Decisions of the Patent Office Board of Appeals illustrate the practice . See , e.g. , Ex parte Pfenning , 65 U.S.P.Q . 577 ( Pat.Off.Bd.App.1945 ) ( allowing claim `` directed to a product which results from the method of claim 9 '' in light of applicant 's argument that `` it is impossible in the instant case to define the product adequately in terms of the elements which compose it or in terms of its physical characteristics '' ) ; Ex parte Lessig , 57 U.S.P.Q . 129 ( Pat.Off.Bd.App.1943 ) ( allowing claim for a `` product containing vulcanized rubber '' strongly adhered to fibers which `` has been prepared by the process of claim 4 '' because `` it is not possible to otherwise distinguish over the art of record '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Commentators have explained that this claiming practice became of increasing importance as the complex sciences blossomed . See , e.g. , Mark D. Passler , Product-by-Process Patent Claims : Majority of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Forgets Purpose of the Patent Act , 49 U. Miami L.Rev . 233 , 233 n. 3 ( 1994 ) ( `` Such claims are often used by companies to patent complex drug or chemical products whose structure is not completely understood and , therefore , can only be accurately described by the process through which it is made. '' ) . It is well known that the full structure of some chemical and biological products is not always known at the time the patent application is filed . Indeed , it is a tenet of the scientific method that explanation and theory tend to follow , not precede , the observation of a development in the science . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The CCPA continued to recognize the use of process terms to aid in describing new products-the form of claim sometimes called a `` pure '' product-by-process claim , see n. 1 supra-and repeatedly ruled that such claims are properly viewed *1305 as product , not process , claims . The court also disallowed such claims where the product itself was not novel and unobvious . The court confirmed that such a claim , when justified for a novel and unobvious product , is properly construed as encompassing the full scope of a product claim . For example , in In re Bridgeford , 53 C.C.P.A . 1182 , 357 F.2d 679 ( 1966 ) , the court again explained that a new product may be defined by the process of making it if there is no other way to describe the product , stressing that `` the invention so defined is a product and not a process , '' id . at 682 . The Bridgeford court relied on this view of the scope of the product-by-process claims in a related patent , and held unpatentable for double patenting claims that defined the `` product per se . '' Id . at 680 . The court explained that product-by-process claims are true product claims , and overruled the suggestion in In re Freeman , 35 C.C.P.A . 920 , 166 F.2d 178 , 181 ( 1948 ) , that product-by-process claims are `` dependen [ t ] ... on process limitations '' and therefore coextensive with process claims . Bridgeford , 357 F.2d at 683 n. 6 ( `` While there is some language in Freeman to support the contention that a product-by-process type claim differs only 'in scope ' from a process type claim and they therefore 'are directed to a single invention , ' ( 166 F.2d at 181 ) so far as this is inconsistent with our holding here it must be overruled. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ My colleagues misstate the holding of Bridgeford , for Bridgeford directly contravenes today 's holding . In Bridgeford the CCPA noted that `` some courts '' have construed claims with process steps as limited to the recited process , id . at 683 n. 5 , apparently without inquiring whether the rule of necessity justified full product scope for the invention at issue . The CCPA 's observation that patents are construed inconsistently in other courts can not be taken , as apparently do my colleagues , as error by the CCPA . To the contrary , the inconsistency among courts led eventually to consolidation.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Again in In re Brown , 59 C.C.P.A . 1036 , 459 F.2d 531 ( 1972 ) , the CCPA explained that product-by-process claims are product claims , not process claims , and that the patentability of the product must be established independently of the process by which it is identified . See id . at 535 ( `` [ I ] n spite of the fact that the claim may recite only process limitations , it is the patentability of the product claimed and not of the recited process steps which must be established. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Other decisions discussing application of this expedient to claims directed to complex new products include In re Pilkington , 56 C.C.P.A . 1237 , 411 F.2d 1345 , 1349 ( 1969 ) ( `` While we are satisfied that the references of record do not anticipate appellant 's glass or demonstrate that it would be obvious , the differences between that glass and the glass of the prior art do not appear to us to be particularly susceptible to definition by the conventional recitation of properties or structure . `` ) , and In re Fessmann , 489 F.2d 742 , 743 ( CCPA 1974 ) ( affirming obviousness rejection of product-by-process claim directed to a `` liquid smoke '' product , but observing that prior art compositions `` are complex mixtures of the chemical compounds which can be derived from wood '' which `` defy simple characterization and this fact presumably accounts for the use of product-by-process *1306 claims '' ) . The need for this expedient , and the proper scope afforded such claims , is summarized in the treatise Walker on Patents : _NEWLINE_ [ P ] atent rights over a chemical product are typically independent of the process by which the product is made , and are particularly valuable because of this fact . This independence is normally accomplished by defining the product in terms of its structural features alone , with no reference in the claims to process steps whatsoever . The state of chemical technology , however , is sometimes too limited for a structural description of this type to be made . The structure of some chemicals , especially those including elaborate polymer chains , can not be accurately determined . The same chemicals , however , may be both economically valuable and technologically reproducible , in the sense that they can be reliably made by subjecting a particular set of raw materials to a particular set of process steps . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * _NEWLINE_ The law reacted to these difficulties by making it easier to obtain traditional product protection over this special class of chemicals . The inventor was allowed to describe such a chemical in terms of how one gained possession of it , that is , by way of the process steps by which it was made . Once he did so , the law preserved to the inventor the fullest measure of product-only protection that it could ; it treated the process recitations as proxies for the direct recitations of structure that could not be made . Such a claim was therefore equivalent to one stated in terms of structure only . It would broadly dominate all methods by which the chemical could be made or used . At the same time , it carried the same dangers of running afoul of the art : it would be anticipated if the chemical had been produced previously , even if by a method other than what the inventor disclosed . _NEWLINE_ 1 Moy 's Walker on Patents ¡± 4:74 ( 4th ed.2008 ) ( emphases added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The en banc court appears to misunderstand this precedent , for my colleagues now state that `` binding case law '' of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Court of Claims mandates a single rule for all claims that contain any process terms , whether the product is novel or known , citing In re Hughes , 496 F.2d 1216 ( CCPA 1974 ) , for this proposition . However , Hughes does not state this proposition ; Hughes stands for the contrary proposition . In Hughes the question was the patentability of claims directed to `` shakes '' as are used in roofing , as follows : _NEWLINE_ 12 . Shakes manufactured from a shake bolt by the process of making a plurality of cuts into and across the shake bolt to an extent to establish predetermined tip lengths , and splitting the weather end portions of the shakes from the bolt by starting the splits at the inner ends of the cuts and continuing the splits to the end of the bolt . _NEWLINE_ This claim had been rejected as an improper product-by-process claim , on the ground that the product could be described without including process steps . The Hughes court acknowledged the general rule against product-by-process claiming , but also explained the `` proper exception to the general rule '' as first set forth in Painter , as follows : _NEWLINE_ [ T ] he Commissioner of Patents enunciated the general rule that a product should not be defined in terms of the process of making it . In Painter , a proper exception to the general rule was found on the ground that the product could not be properly defined and discriminated from the prior art otherwise than by reference to the process of producing it . This basic rule and the exception *1307 have been recognized and followed continuously by the Patent Office and the Courts . _NEWLINE_ Hughes , 496 F.2d at 1218 ( quoting approvingly the Solicitor 's argument ) . The court reaffirmed that `` in spite of the fact that a product-by-process claim may recite only process limitations , 'it is the product which is covered by the claim and not the recited process steps . ' `` Id . Contrary to my colleagues ' statement , Hughes did not eliminate this form of claim , or change its role as a product claim . Indeed , the Hughes court applied the exception and reversed the Board 's rejection of a product-by-process claim , stating : _NEWLINE_ We agree with appellant that the [ general ] rule should not be applied to the situation before us . We have been shown no true product claim which describes appellant 's invention , in the words of the solicitor , `` in terms of structure or physical characteristics . '' When an applicant seeks to describe his invention by a product-by-process claim because he finds that his invention is incapable of description solely by structure or physical characteristics , it is incumbent upon the Patent Office to indicate where , or how , the applicant 's invention is , or may be , so described . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 1219 . My colleagues could hardly have selected less apt support for their construction of product-by-process claims , for Hughes explicitly states that such claims are for the product , not the process . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In addition to misstating precedent of the CCPA , the en banc court also mischaracterizes the decisions of our predecessor the Court of Claims , stating that the Court of Claims ' decisions support today 's ruling . The court cites Tri-Wall Containers v. United States , 187 Ct.Cl . 326 , 408 F.2d 748 ( 1969 ) , for this purpose . That citation , too , is mysterious , for in Tri-Wall Containers the court found that the claimed product was not `` new '' because it had been on sale for more than the permitted period , although the product that was on sale had been made by a different process than the process stated in the claim . The Court of Claims stated that the evidence showed that `` the prior art product and the claimed product are structurally identical , '' id . at 751 , and explained that a known product can not be patented by including process terms in the claim : _NEWLINE_ It is well established that a product claimed as made by a new process is not patentable unless the product itself is new . The Wood-Paper Patent , 90 U.S. ( 23 Wall . ) 566 , 596 , 23 L.Ed . 31 ( 1874 ) , Cochrane v. Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik [ `` BASF '' ] , 111 U.S. 293 , 311 , 4 S.Ct . 455 , 28 L.Ed . 433 ( 1984 ) ... . _NEWLINE_ ... . _NEWLINE_ More recent cases point out that the addition of a method step in a product claim , which product is not patentably distinguishable from the prior art , can not impart patentability to the old product . Jungersen v. Baden , 69 F.Supp . 922 , 928 ( S.D.N.Y.1947 ) , aff 'd , 166 F.2d 807 ( 2d Cir.1948 ) , aff 'd , 335 U.S. 560 , 69 S.Ct . 269 , 93 L.Ed . 235 ( 1949 ) ; In re Stephens , 345 F.2d 1020 , 1023 , 52 C.C.P.A . 1409 ( 1965 ) . _NEWLINE_ Tri-Wall Containers , 408 F.2d at 750-51 . This case applied the standard rule that old products can not be patented-it contains no statement limiting the scope of claims that include process aspects to aid in describing new products . The Supreme Court cases cited in Tri-Wall are all directed to new processes for making old products-these are the same cases that the en banc court today incorrectly applies to new products , as I discuss post . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Contrary to my colleagues ' statement , CCPA and Court of Claims precedent do not support today 's en banc thesis . Our predecessor courts understood the complexity of patenting , and the CCPA consistently *1308 implemented the expedient whereby process terms contributed to the description of complex new products of incompletely known structure . These courts recognized the independence of product claims for new products , and did not limit such claims to the specific process steps that were used to aid in describing the product.3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With the advent of the Federal Circuit , this court continued to apply these principles . In In re Thorpe , 777 F.2d 695 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) , the court explained that product-by-process claims are anticipated when the product existed in the prior art , even if the product was made by a different process . My colleagues are mistaken in stating that Thorpe held that all such claims are to be construed as process claims , even when the product is new and the rule of necessity justifies this mode of describing the invention . In Thorpe the product was not new ; it was a known color developer for carbonless paper copy systems , and this court held that the PTO correctly rejected the claim to `` the product of the process of claim 1 , '' explaining that since the product was old it could not be claimed as a product , whether or not process steps are recited in the claim . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The facts of Thorpe did not concern the exception and expedient where process terms are invoked to describe a new product of complex structure . This exception is rarely invoked . The general rule requiring claims to have a process-free definition of the structure of a new product accommodates most inventions . Some recent exceptions are seen in emerging aspects of biotechnology . For example , in Amgen , Inc. v. Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. , 706 F.Supp . 94 ( D.Mass.1989 ) , aff 'd in relevant part , 927 F.2d 1200 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) , the district court considered the following claim : _NEWLINE_ 4 . A procaryotic or eucaryotic host cell transformed or transfected with a DNA sequence according to claim 1 , 2 or 3 in a manner allowing the host cell to express erythropoietin . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 108 . The district court found claim 4 `` ambiguous , '' explaining that while it is directed to a new product-this host cell-the words `` transformed or transfected '' appear to invoke a process . The district court recognized that `` [ i ] n the traditional patent framework , a product is wholly separate and distinct from a process . '' Id . at 107 . The court observed that `` [ a ] product patent gives the patentee the right to restrict the use and sale of the product regardless of how and by whom it was manufactured , '' while `` [ a ] process patentee 's power extends only to those products made by the patented process . '' Id . ( quoting United States v. Studiengesellschaft Kohle , 670 F.2d 1122 , 1127-28 ( D.C.Cir.1981 ) ) . The district court , affirmed by the *1309 Federal Circuit , found this claim to be valid and infringed as a product claim , and although many issues and arguments were present in this litigation , the applicability of the venerable rule of necessity was not at issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation v. Genentech , Inc. , 927 F.2d 1565 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) , the Federal Circuit addressed the interpretation and scope of claims exemplified by claim 13 : _NEWLINE_ 13 . Highly purified and concentrated VIII : C prepared in accordance with the method of claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 set forth the method referred to in claim 13 , as follows : _NEWLINE_ 1 . An improved method of preparing Factor VIII procoagulant activity protein [ VIII : C ] comprising the steps of _NEWLINE_ ( a ) adsorbing a VIII : C/VIII : RP complex from a plasma or commercial concentrate source onto particles bound to a monoclonal antibody specific to VIII : RP , _NEWLINE_ ( b ) eluting the VIII : C , _NEWLINE_ ( c ) adsorbing the VIII : C obtained in step ( b ) in another adsorption to concentrate and further purify same , _NEWLINE_ ( d ) eluting the adsorbed VIII : C , and _NEWLINE_ ( e ) recovering highly purified and concentrated VIII : C. _NEWLINE_ It was not disputed that the product was a new product , that the `` highly purified and concentrated '' blood clotting Factor VIII : C had not previously been obtained , and that a complete structural identification of Factor VIII : C was not available . The defendant Genentech had made its commercial Factor VIII : C not by the method set forth in claim 1 , but by using a sample of the Scripps product to `` clone '' Factor VIII : C protein using recombinant DNA techniques . One question presented in the case was whether claims such as claim 13 were infringed by the same product produced by a different method , or whether such claims were infringed only if the accused infringer used the process of claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Scripps stressed that its product was novel and enabled and was patentable as a product , although the full structure of Factor VIII : C was not available at that stage of the science . The court addressed whether claims exemplified by claim 13 , properly construed , were product claims , or whether they were limited to the specific processes in the process claims to which they referred . This court held that the claims were product claims . The court held that since claims are construed the same way for infringement as for validity , the question was whether the Genentech product was the same as the claimed product , not whether they were produced by the same process . The court remanded to the district court for this factual determination . Scripps , 927 F.2d at 1584 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After Scripps was decided , a panel of this court decided an appeal concerning plastic innersoles for shoes . In Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp. , 970 F.2d 834 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) , the claims at issue were represented by : _NEWLINE_ Claim 24 . The product produced by the method of claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ In turn , claim 1 was as follows : _NEWLINE_ 1 . In a method of manufacturing a shock-absorbing , molded innersole for insertion in footwear , which method comprises : _NEWLINE_ ( a ) introducing an expandable , polyurethane into a mold ; and _NEWLINE_ ( b ) recovering from the mold an innersole which comprises a contoured heel and arch section composed of a substantially open-celled polyurethane foam material , the improvement which comprises : _NEWLINE_ ( i ) placing an elastomeric insert material into the mold , the insert material having greater shock-absorbing *1310 properties and being less resilient than the molded , open-celled polyurethane foam material , and the insert material having sufficient surface tack to remain in the placed position in the mold on the introduction of the expandable polyurethane material so as to permit the expandable polyurethane material to expand about the insert material without displacement of the insert material ; and _NEWLINE_ ( ii ) recovering a molded innersole with the insert material having a tacky surface forming a part of the exposed bottom surface of the recovered innersole . _NEWLINE_ The panel held that a claim in the form of claim 24 always requires use of the referenced method , and that it is irrelevant whether the product was new or known . The court stated that the rule of necessity , as applied in Scripps , is contrary to Supreme Court rulings . The panel stated that the decision in Scripps is incorrect . A majority of the Federal Circuit declined to resolve the conflict en banc , resulting in several further opinions . E.g. , Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp. , 974 F.2d 1279 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) ( dissents of Chief Judge Nies and Judges Rich , Newman , and Lourie from denial of rehearing en banc ) . Judge Rich wrote : _NEWLINE_ [ T ] his whole excursion was unnecessary because the patentee admitted that claim 24 , the product-by-process claim , was limited to the process . The claim read : `` The molded innersole produced by the method of claim 1 . '' There was , therefore , no occasion to review the law to determine how the claim should be construed ... . We are not here to provide restatements of the law . Such restatements should not be made without an opportunity for all affected parties to be heard from . The affected parties here are not the vendors of inner soles but largely the entire chemical industry , particularly the pharmaceutical manufacturers . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 1280 ( Rich , J. , dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Most trial courts continued to recognize the rule of necessity . For example , in Trustees of Columbia University v. Roche Diagnostics GmbH , 126 F.Supp.2d 16 ( D.Mass.2000 ) , the district court considered claims such as the following . _NEWLINE_ 72 . A eukaryotic cell into which foreign DNA I has been inserted in accordance with the process of claim 54 . _NEWLINE_ The court referred to the Scripps/Atlantic conflict , concluded that the earlier panel decision controlled under the Federal Circuit 's rule , see Newell Companies , Inc. v. Kenney Manufacturing Co. , 864 F.2d 757 , 765 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( `` This court has adopted the rule that prior decisions of a panel of the court are binding precedent on subsequent panels unless and until overturned in banc . `` ) , and applied the Scripps ruling , holding that the new cell was not limited by the process by which it was made . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The PTO also continued to apply the rule of necessity . In instructing examiners that products should whenever possible be described without reference to how they were made , the PTO continued to point out the exception that patentability as a product is not foreclosed when independent description is not available . The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure ( MPEP ) instructs the examiner to consider the structure implied by any process steps in the claim : _NEWLINE_ The structure implied by the process steps should be considered when assessing the patentability of product-by-process claims over the prior art , especially where the product can only be defined by the process steps by which the product is made , or where the manufacturing process steps would be expected to impart *1311 distinctive structural characteristics to the final product . _NEWLINE_ MPEP ¡± 2113 ( 8th ed. , July 2008 rev. ) . This has been the practice since at least Ex parte Painter in 1891 . I am surprised at the en banc court 's casual misstatement about `` the treatment of product-by-process claims throughout the years by the PTO , '' maj. op . at 1293 , for the statement is directly contrary to the treatment of such claims throughout the years by the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The en banc court 's insistence that one universal rule should now be applied is contrary to the entire body of decisional law , including the Supreme Court cases cited by my colleagues . As I next discuss , in most of the cited cases the product was not a new product and thus was not patentable as a product , whether or not any process term was included in the claim . The Court consistently held that when the product was old and only the process was a patentable invention , a claim for the `` product of that process '' could not cover the old product made by a different process . That is , and has always been , the law . I comment briefly on the Court 's cases that my colleagues misinterpret and misapply : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Cochrane v. BASF _NEWLINE_ The en banc opinion relies primarily on Cochrane v. Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik , 111 U.S. 293 , 4 S.Ct . 455 , 28 L.Ed . 433 ( 1884 ) ( `` BASF `` ) , even though my colleagues acknowledge that the product in that case was the well-known dye alizarine . The patent before the Court was a reissue patent that claimed artificial alizarine in the following way : _NEWLINE_ Artificial alizarine , produced by either of the methods herein described , or by any other method which will produce a like result . _NEWLINE_ The Court held that since alizarine was a known product , the claim was limited to the patentee 's two processes , stating : _NEWLINE_ It was an old article . While a new process for producing it was patentable , the product itself could not be patented , even though it was a product made artificially for the first time , in contradistinction from being eliminated from the madder root . Calling it artificial alizarine did not make it a new composition of matter , and patentable as such , by reason of its having been prepared , artificially , for the first time , from anthracite , if it was set forth as alizarine , a well-known substance . Wood-Paper Patent , 23 Wall . 566 , 593 [ 23 L.Ed . 31 ( 1874 ) ] . There was therefore no foundation for reissue No . 4,321 , for the product , because , on the description given , no patent for the product could have been taken out originally . _NEWLINE_ 111 U.S. at 311-12 , 4 S.Ct . 455 . The Court accordingly limited the claim to the two processes described in the patent , and in the portion of BASF quoted by my colleagues , the Court discussed the proofs needed to show infringement : _NEWLINE_ [ U ] nless it is shown that the process of [ the specification ] was followed to produce the defendants ' article , or unless it is shown that the article could not be produced by any other process , the defendants ' article can not be identified as the product of the process of [ the specification ] . Nothing of the kind is shown . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 310 , 4 S.Ct . 455 . The Court did not state , or imply , despite my colleagues ' contrary theory , that a claim to a new and complex product that is of necessity defined and distinguished by the process by which it was made , can never be infringed unless that specific process is practiced . There was no issue in BASF of a product that could not be defined without reference to how it was made . The BASF Court , providing guidance , remarked on the importance of independent description of a *1312 patented product , in the following sentence cited by my colleagues : _NEWLINE_ Every patent for a product or composition of matter must identify it so that it can be recognized aside from the description of the process for making it , or else nothing can be held to infringe the patent which is not made by that process . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 310 , 4 S.Ct . 455 . This statement is indeed the general rule , as stated by the Patent Commissioner several years later in Ex parte Painter . However , BASF did not present the situation for which the expedient of necessity was created , for as the Court stated , the invention was `` a process for preparing alizarine , not as a new substance prepared for the first time , but as the substance already known as alizarine , to be prepared , however , by the new process , which process is to be the subject of the patent , and is the process of preparing the known product alizarine from anthracine . '' Id . at 308-09 , 4 S.Ct . 455 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This was not an instance of a new product describable only in terms of its process of manufacture . The BASF decision lends no support to today 's en banc rule that every product claim that mentions a process step is always restricted to that process , with no exception , no expedient , no preservation of the distinctions among forms of claim based on the nature of the invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Goodyear Dental cases _NEWLINE_ The en banc court also states that its new ruling is supported by two cases relating to a patent on the use of vulcanized rubber to form a plate for holding dentures , Smith v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. , 93 U.S. ( 3 Otto ) 486 , 23 L.Ed . 952 ( 1876 ) , and Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v. Davis , 102 U.S. ( 12 Otto ) 222 , 26 L.Ed . 149 ( 1880 ) . Review of these cases reveals no support for the en banc court 's statement of their holdings . The claim at issue was : _NEWLINE_ The plate of hard rubber or vulcanite , or its equivalent , for holding artificial teeth , or teeth and gums , substantially as described . _NEWLINE_ Davis , 102 U.S. ( 12 Otto ) at 223 . The claim was written in the then-standard format of incorporating the description in the specification through the phrase `` substantially as described . '' This was not a product-by-process or product-of-the-process claim at all , for the claim contains no process distinction or limitation , but simply refers to the description in the specification . Nonetheless , the en banc majority appears to state that these cases mean that the Supreme Court requires that all claims for products whose method of production is set forth in the specification-as is required by the description and enablement requirement- can not be infringed unless that method is used . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ That is not what the Goodyear Dental cases said . The Court referred to the position of Goodyear Dental Vulcanite that its patent covered all dental plates made of vulcanized rubber , and held , upon reviewing the specification and the prior art , that the process of manufacture was what distinguished this dental plate from the prior art dental plates , and concluded : `` The invention , then , is a product or manufacture made in a defined manner . It is not a product alone , separated from the process by which it is created . '' Smith , 93 U.S. ( 3 Otto ) at 493 . Were the claim not limited to this process , the Court concluded that the claim would not have been patentable . See id . at 492 ( holding that if the patent were for a `` mere substitution of vulcanite for other materials , which had previously been employed as a base for artificial sets of teeth '' then it `` constituted no invention '' ) . Four years later , considering the same patent in Davis , the Court emphasized *1313 that the claim was limited to use of vulcanized rubber or its equivalent , and held that since the accused infringer made its dental plate with celluloid , there could not be infringement . See 102 U.S. ( 12 Otto ) at 228-30 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court today cites these cases as definitive of the interpretation of claims with process elements , although the only process referent is the phrase `` substantially as described . '' This flawed reasoning was disposed of in 1890 in the classic Robinson on Patents , and until now has not reappeared : _NEWLINE_ In stating Claims certain phrases are frequently employed to which a special importance seems to be attached by applicants . Among these are the phrase `` substantially as described '' and others of the same meaning . These phrases import the same thing when used in a Claim as when elsewhere employed . They are neither necessary nor technical . The reference they make to the Description is always implied , and relates only to the essential features of the invention as therein delineated . They add nothing , therefore , to the certainty of the Claim , nor do they detract from it unless the claimant carelessly inserts them as a substitute for a more clear and definite statement of his invention . _NEWLINE_ II W.C. Robinson , Robinson on Patents 517 ( 1890 ) ( footnotes omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Merrill v. Yeomans _NEWLINE_ My colleagues also rely on Merrill v. Yeomans , 94 U.S. ( 4 Otto ) 568 , 24 L.Ed . 235 ( 1877 ) . Again , the relevance is remote . The Merrill Court explained that the issue was the `` correct construction of plaintiff 's patent , '' id . at 569 , construing the following claim : _NEWLINE_ [ T ] he above-described new manufacture of the deodorized heavy hydrocarbon oils , suitable for lubricating and other purposes , free from the characteristic odors of hydrocarbon oils , and having a slight smell like fatty oil , from hydrocarbon oils , by treating them substantially as hereinbefore described . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 570 . The Court examined the specification to determine what was invented , and found that the invention was directed solely to a process , not to a product . The Court then concluded that the claim 's usage `` new manufacture '' referred to the manufacturing process , and not to the product . The claim was thus a process claim , and no `` product-by-process '' issue was presented . The Court concluded that the defendant 's oil , which was made by a different process , did not infringe . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Merrill Court discussed its practice of looking to the patent application and interpreting the claim in light of what was `` really invented '' : _NEWLINE_ [ W ] here it appears that a valuable invention has really been made , this court , giving full effect to all that is found in the application on which the Patent Office acted , will uphold that which was really invented , and which comes within any fair interpretation of the patentee 's assertion of claim . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 573 . This approach is inimical to the en banc court 's theory that it is irrelevant what the patentee describes as his invention , and that if a process step is mentioned in the claim or `` substantially described '' in the specification , the claim always requires performance of that step . Although the Court in Merrill was not confronted with a situation of indescribable product or necessity bred of complexity-indeed no product at all was claimed-neither did the Court hold that every product invention must be limited by the process that produced the product . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Wood Paper Patent case _NEWLINE_ The list of Supreme Court cases relied on by my colleagues continues with *1314 The Wood-Paper Patent , 90 U.S. 566 , 596 , 23 Wall . 566 , 23 L.Ed . 31 ( 1874 ) , where claims with the standard `` substantially as described '' language were construed in two reissue patents relating to the pulping of wood to make paper . The Court explained that one reissue patent was for `` a product or manufacture , and not for the process by which the product may be obtained , '' and the other `` for a process and not for its product . '' Id . at 593 . The Court examined the prior art and concluded that the claim for the product could not be sustained , because the product produced by the inventor 's new pulping process was not new : _NEWLINE_ Paper-pulp obtained from various vegetable substances was in common use before the original patent was granted to Watt & Burgess , and whatever may be said of their process for obtaining it , the product was in no sense new . The reissued patent , No . 1448 , is , therefore , void for want of novelty in the manufacture patented . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 596 . The Court then discussed the reissue patent for the `` process and not for its product , '' and held this reissue void because it claimed a different invention than in the original patent . The Court also discussed several other patents directed to boilers used to produce paper-pulp , and to a process for bleaching straw . Nothing in this case concerns the product-by-process issue on which the court is today acting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I can not discern why the en banc court relies on The Wood-Paper Patent case as invalidating Scripps , and the court has not attempted to explain . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Plummer v. Sargent _NEWLINE_ The en banc court also relies on Plummer v. Sargent , 120 U.S. 442 , 7 S.Ct . 640 , 30 L.Ed . 737 ( 1887 ) , which again provides no support for my colleagues ' thesis . This case again illustrates the Court 's practice of reviewing what the patentee stated he invented as set forth in the specification in light of the prior art . The claim in Plummer was for a `` new manufacture , '' `` substantially as described '' : _NEWLINE_ What I claim and desire to procure by letters patent is the new manufacture hereinabove described , consisting of iron ornamented in imitation of bronze by the application of oil and heat , substantially as described . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 445 , 7 S.Ct . 640 . The trial court had found non-infringement because the defendant had used a prior art process for bronzing iron . This prior process was work of F.W . Brocksieper , an employee of the defendant 's predecessor company . The Supreme Court affirmed , stating that the claims were limited to the process described in the specification : _NEWLINE_ It seems necessarily to follow from this view either that the Tucker patents are void by reason of anticipation practiced by Brocksieper , or that the patented process and product must be restricted to exactly what is described ... . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 449 , 7 S.Ct . 640 . The Court thus limited the claims to the process described by the patentee , not because of any rule about limiting a product to how it was made in the specification , but to sustain validity of the patent in view of the Brocksieper prior art . The decision in Plummer is unrelated to any rule of claim construction based on whether process terms are included in the claim . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ These nineteenth-century cases do not relate to the en banc court 's new universal rule of claim construction , whereby all product claims having process terms are treated as process claims , whatever the nature of the product , whatever the need for process descriptors , or any other factor that precedent shows to be relevant to the exception that is here at issue as to the use of and construction of such claims . Nor do any more recent Court cases . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ General Electric v. Wabash _NEWLINE_ My colleagues also cite *1315 General Electric Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp. , 304 U.S. 364 , 58 S.Ct . 899 , 82 L.Ed . 1402 ( 1938 ) , although the relevance of this case is , again , not apparent , for it involved no product-by-process claims , but rather claims that recite the properties of the product . A typical claim is claim 25 , which describes an electric lamp filament composed of tungsten grains of a size and shape that prevents sagging of the filament : _NEWLINE_ 25 . A filament for electric incandescent lamps or other devices , composed substantially of tungsten and made up mainly of a number of comparatively large grains of such size and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and offsetting during a normal or commercially useful life for such a lamp or other device . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 368 , 58 S.Ct . 899 . The Court held this claim `` invalid on its face '' for failing to provide a `` distinct and definite statement of what he claims to be new , and to be his invention . '' Id . at 369 , 58 S.Ct . 899 . The Court stated that the description of the grains as `` of such size and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and offsetting '' was `` inadequate as a description of the structural characteristics of the grains . '' Id . at 370 , 58 S.Ct . 899 . The Court also criticized the use of functional language in the claim , stating that such terms were too indefinite to provide clear guidance . Id . at 371 , 58 S.Ct . 899 . There was no issue of whether process steps in the claims were regarded as limiting , for there were no process steps in the claims . Instead , the Court stated that even the implicit inclusion of process steps could not save the claim , because the description of the process in the specification was inadequate : _NEWLINE_ Even assuming that definiteness may be imparted to the product claim by that part of the specification which purportedly details only a method of making the product , the description of the Pacz process is likewise silent as to the nature of the filament product . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 373 , 58 S.Ct . 899 . The Court held the patent invalid for lack of a `` distinct and definite '' description of the invention , for the court `` doubted whether one who discovers or invents a product he knows to be new will ever find it impossible to describe some aspect of its novelty . '' Id . Whatever the inadequacies in the Pacz description of his invention , the Court 's optimistic view of scientific capability can not be deemed to have barred all recourse to the rule of necessity when it is warranted , or to have voided the ensuing seventy-one years of Patent Office and judicial recognition of this pragmatic expedient . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ No Supreme Court case discussed the problems of complexity and structural analysis that warrant this expedient , or created a legal solution to these problems . It is inappropriate , unsupported by law or precedent , and contrary to the purposes of patent systems , for this court now to rule that such products can not be patented as products . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Regional circuit decisions _NEWLINE_ My colleagues also rely on some decisions of the regional circuits preceding this court 's formation , announcing that `` our sister circuits also followed the general rule that the defining process terms limit product-by-process claims , '' and citing two cases , one decided in 1915 and one in 1977 . These cases do not support the en banc court 's opinion,4 and raised no issue of an expedient based on necessity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1316 In Hide-Ite Leather Co. v. Fiber Products Co. , 226 F. 34 ( 1st Cir.1915 ) , the appeal was of two process claims for making leatherboard , and a product claim for leatherboard `` made from pulp '' and reciting the second step in the process claims plus the reference `` substantially as described . '' The accused infringer did not use the same first step of the process . The court found that the invention was for a process , not a product , and therefore that the product claim was not infringed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ My colleagues also cite Paeco , Inc. v. Applied Moldings , Inc. , 562 F.2d 870 , 876 ( 3d Cir.1977 ) , in which the court used the specification to resolve an ambiguity in the language of a product claim relating to `` replica wooden beams '' made of foamed urethane . The court reviewed whether ambiguous claim language required a closed or open mold , for this determined the question of anticipation based on a prior art reference that used an open mold . Thus the court stated that the manufacturing process described in the specification was `` of paramount importance , '' and construed the claim in light of that process as requiring a closed mold , thus preserving the claim 's validity as against the prior art that used and open mold . The sentence quoted by my colleagues out of its context , does not relate to the en banc court 's new rule concerning process terms in product claims , and the Paeco case raised no question of whether the product was capable of description apart from the process . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In addition to these two cases inaptly cited by the en banc court , other regional circuit decisions also contradict this court 's new thesis . In Dunn Wire-Cut Lug Brick Co. v. Toronto Fire Clay Co. , 259 F. 258 ( 6th Cir.1919 ) , the court stated : `` Certain it is , in view of the weight of authority and the latest decisions , that the inventor of a new and useful product or article of manufacture may have a patent which covers it and gives a monopoly upon it regardless of great variations in the method of making . '' Id . at 261 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Buono v. Yankee Maid Dress Corp. , 77 F.2d 274 ( 2d Cir.1935 ) ( L.Hand , J . ) , the court held invalid a product claim for a kind of `` blind stitch '' used in sewing , because the invention lay only in the process of producing the stitch , which itself `` was not new . '' Id . at 279 . While the stitch had not been claimed as the product of a particular machine or process , the court remarked on the conceivability of patenting such a product `` merely as the product of a machine or process , even though it were anticipated if made in other ways , '' id. , observing that such a claim might serve a useful purpose in protecting against products that were produced by the same machine or process abroad and then imported . Of such a claim , wherein the product itself was anticipated but the process was new , the court stated `` it would in that case not be infringed by anything but the product of the ... process . '' Id . This routine statement of established *1317 law does not mean that when the product is itself new and useful and unobvious , it can not be claimed as a product but must be tied to the machine that made it . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Judge Hand emphasized that this example related only to situations where the product itself was not new . The opinion explained that to be claimed as a product , the product `` must be new as such , that is , regardless of the process or machine which makes it ; and it must stand upon its own invention , again independently of the machine or process which makes it . '' Id . This was also the CCPA 's view of product claims , providing the precedent carried forward to , and binding upon the Federal Circuit.5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ THE EN BANC RULING _NEWLINE_ Defying precedent , the en banc court adopts for all situations `` the basic rule that the process terms limit product-by-process claims , '' maj. op . at 1293 , whether the product is novel or known , and whether or not the new product could not have been fully described by its structure alone . The court eliminates the long-accepted expedient for new products whose structure is not fully known . While the Scripps decision is the only decision that is mentioned as `` expressly overruled , '' maj. op . at 1293 , Scripps is only one of many cases now discarded . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The en banc majority 's response to the dissenters is to state that `` the inventor is absolutely free to use process steps to define this product '' if its `` structure is either not fully known or too complex to analyze , '' maj. op . at 1294 , but to eliminate the premise that the inventor thereby obtains a product claim , not a process claim . According to the majority , a patentee can continue to obtain product claims using process descriptors , but such product claims are treated as process claims for infringement . The applicant would still have to demonstrate patentability of the new product as a product ( independent of the process ) , while enforcement of the patent against an identical product would be limited to the infringer 's use of the process steps used as a descriptor . For the first time , claims are construed differently for validity and for infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It has been an inviolate rule that patent claims are construed the same way for validity and for infringement . See , e.g. , Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel , Inc. , 314 F.3d 1313 , 1330 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( `` It is axiomatic that claims are construed the same way for both invalidity and infringement . `` ) ; Amazon.com , Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1343 , 1351 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( `` Because the claims of a patent measure the invention at issue , the claims must be interpreted and given the same meaning for purposes of both validity and infringement analyses . `` ) ; C.R . Bard , Inc. v. M3 Systems , Inc. , 157 F.3d 1340 , 1363 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( `` Claims must be interpreted the same way for determining infringement as was done to sustain their validity . `` ) ; Southwall Technologies , Inc. v. *1318 Cardinal IG Co. , 54 F.3d 1570 , 1576 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ( `` Claims may not be construed one way in order to obtain their allowance and in a different way against accused infringers . `` ) ; Beachcombers , International , Inc. v. WildeWood Creative Products , Inc. , 31 F.3d 1154 , 1163 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) ( `` We have already interpreted the claims for purposes of assessing their validity . The same claim interpretation of course applies to the infringement analysis . `` ) ; Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation v. Genentech , Inc. , 927 F.2d 1565 , 1583 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( `` claims must be construed the same way for validity and for infringement '' ) ; SmithKline Diagnostics , Inc. v. Helena Laboratories Corp. , 859 F.2d 878 , 882 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( `` The claims of the ¡¬970 patent measure the invention at issue ; thus , the claims must be interpreted and given the same meaning for purposes of both validity and infringement analyses . `` ) ; see also 5A Chisum on Patents ¡± 18.01 ( 2007 ) ( `` A fundamental tenet of patent law is that a claim must be interpreted consistently for purposes of infringement and validity . `` ) ; id . ¡± 18.03 [ 2 ] [ h ] ( collecting cases ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As interpreted for validity , the claims obtained under the expedient of necessity are product claims , and are subject to the requirements of novelty , unobviousness , and all other requirements for new products , independent of how the products can be made . My colleagues hold that these are product claims for validity , but process claims for infringement . Departure from the rule that forbids such deviation requires sound reason , and fuller exploration than the cursory brush-off dispensed by my colleagues . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I do agree with my colleagues that their logic is `` simple . '' Maj. op . at 1294 . However , today 's inventions are not simple . The needs of inventions of the past and present , and more so the future , are not simple . The public interest in invention and development of today 's complex sciences , is not simple . The en banc court 's `` simple '' hypothetical about `` compound X , obtained by process Y , '' is simply irrelevant to the issues we must resolve . Scientists know that it is often easier to show that two products are the same , than to decipher their chemical or biological structure ; for example , in the case at bar , comparing the X-ray diffraction patterns and absorption spectra could show that the products are the same , although their exact crystal structure is undefined . However , my colleagues announce that the only way to establish whether the accused compound is the same as the patented compound is by inquiring whether they were prepared by the same method . Maj. op . at 1293-94 ( `` [ W ] hat analytical tools can confirm that the alleged infringer 's compound is in fact infringing , other than a comparison of the claimed and accused infringing processes ? '' ) . That question has many answers , now stated to be irrelevant . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While the section of this opinion decided by the en banc court is largely directed to its reversal of precedent , the implementation of its ruling remains with the original panel . The panel decision enlarges the en banc ruling , further binding this court . The claims at issue state processes by which the new crystal form is `` obtainable , '' although the specification states that other methods might be used . The panel rules that a claim `` can not capture a product obtained by or obtainable by processes other than those explicitly recited in the claims . '' maj. op . at 1295 , finding authority in BASF , which I have discussed ante . My colleagues thus continue to misapply the Court 's ruling in BASF , where the Court stated repeatedly that the product in that case was a known product . BASF , 111 U.S. at 311 , 4 S.Ct . 455 ( `` It was an old article. '' ) . In BASF the Court responded to the patentee 's argument that it was entitled to cover all artificial alizarine *1319 made by any process , by observing that the patentee had not shown how the infringing and patented products `` can be recognized , '' id . at 310 , 4 S.Ct . 455 , an aspect at the opposite pole from the case at bar , where the patentee provided elaborate details as to how the patented and accused crystal forms can be recognized . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel also states that `` the applicant 's statement in the file wrapper that 'the method of preparation ... is not considered the heart of the present invention ' should not be afforded undue gravitas . '' Maj. op . at 1296 . This too is an aberration of precedent , and is contrary to the many rulings of the Supreme Court and this court that afford due gravitas to the applicant 's statement of what has been invented . See , e.g. , BASF , 111 U.S. at 308 , 4 S.Ct . 455 ( `` It is very plain that the specification of the original patent , No . 95,465 , states the invention to be a process for preparing alizarine , not as a new substance prepared for the first time , but as the substance already known as alizarine , to be prepared , however , by the new process , which process is to be the subject of the patent ... . '' ) ; Plummer v. Sargent , 120 U.S. at 443 , 7 S.Ct . 640 ( quoting specification of companion patent , where inventor stated `` My invention consists in a process of covering iron with a very thin coating of oil , and then subjecting it to heat , the effect of which is to leave upon the iron a firm film , which is very durable , and gives the iron a highly ornamental appearance , like that of bronze '' ) . The Federal Circuit 's emphasis on the importance of the specification has been repeatedly stated . E.g. , Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1315 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( en banc ) ( `` [ T ] he specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis . Usually , it is dispositive ; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term . '' ( internal quotation marks omitted ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The en banc court appears to misjudge the implications of its ruling , for the court states that it is now making available to `` others the right to freely practice process Z [ a different process ] that may produce a better product in a better way . '' Maj. op . at 1294 . If others can indeed make a better product , this expedient presents no impediment . That is not the issue of this case . The issue is the right to make the same product , by making a process change that does not change the product . By now assuring that right , the exclusionary value of the claim to a new product is lost . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The purpose of the rule of necessity is to allow inventors of complex new products to obtain the patent scope to which their invention is entitled-the scope of the novel product they invented , no more and no less . The majority 's change of law simply imposes unfairness as well as legal error on patent-supported advances . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ SUMMARY _NEWLINE_ Precedent establishes that the correct construction of claims that recite process steps depends , like all claim construction , on what has been invented . No single rule fits all inventions . The construer must view the claims in light of the description of the invention in the specification , the prior art , and the prosecution history . In the complex law and practice of patents and inventions , the special expedient here of concern arises when the precise structure of a new product is not known from the information available when the patent application was filed . The law has enabled and endorsed this expedient of describing a product in order to claim it as a product , whereby validity and infringement are determined as a product , independent of any process term that was used to aid in defining the product . This expedient does not enlarge patent scope ; it simply permits patenting what has been invented . A narrow *1320 but clear body of law has evolved to accommodate this need of complex technologies . This entire body of law is today overturned , sua sponte and without a hearing , without any participation of those affected , without identification of the intended benefits . I respectfully dissent from the en banc court 's rulings , as well as the procedure by which they were reached . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ LOURIE , Circuit Judge , dissenting from en banc Section III . A . 2 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I respectfully dissent from the court 's en banc holding in Section III . A . 2 that product-by-process claims always require use of the recited process in order to be infringed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I agree that there is substantial Supreme Court precedent that holds that product-by-process claims require use of the recited process for there to be infringement . However , many of those cases applied overly broad language to fact situations involving old products or used vague language that makes it difficult to determine whether the products were old or new . Clearly , however , when a product is old , a product-by-process claim can not be interpreted as a claim to the product made by any means . The product is old and unpatentable per se . BASF in fact involved an old product . See Cochrane v. Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik , 111 U.S. 293 , 311 , 4 S.Ct . 455 , 28 L.Ed . 433 ( 1884 ) ( `` It was an old article. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is arguably a different situation that should apply to chemical-biological products today than to mechanical products of more than a century ago . When a product is new and the inventor claims it by a process of preparation , I fail to see why the product-by-process claim should not be interpreted as a product claim that can be infringed even when the product is made by means other than that recited in the claim . Supreme Court precedent dealing with old products , while utilizing broad language , does not foreclose that possibility . The Court years ago did not have occasion to consider today 's innovations or decide whether a distinction should be made between a new chemical-biological product and an old product made by a new process . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ And there may be differing results depending upon the exact wording of a claim at issue . For example , a claim reading `` when made by '' might only be infringed when the recited process is used by the accused , as it is situational . On the other hand , a claim reading `` obtainable by '' refers to capability , so it might not require use of the process to infringe . `` Obtained by '' is ambiguous . Bright lines have their uses , but judging should take account of differing circumstances . In addition , of course , in order to sustain any claim for infringement , a patent owner must prove that an accused product is the same as that covered by an asserted claim . If the reason a product was claimed by its process was that its structure was unknown , then , if , at the time infringement is asserted , there still is no means to ascertain structurally whether the accused product is the same as that claimed , the infringement claim fails . However , that should not mean that a new product claimed by a process of preparation can not ever be infringed when made by another process . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It may be that with today 's analytical techniques there is little need for product-by-process claims . After all , claim 1 of the Abbott patent is a claim to a compound , not only by name , but also by certain of its characteristics . A claim to a product defined by its characteristics or properties surely is a proper claim . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ However , product-by-process issues still seem to come before us and I would make a distinction between old products and new products in interpreting product-by-process *1321 claims . Accordingly , I respectfully dissent from the court 's en banc holding . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 566 F.3d 1282 , 90 U.S.P.Q.2d 1769 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court , sua sponte , took en banc Section III.A.2 before issuing a panel opinion .

Soc ' y 3 , 3-4 ( 1986 ) , the various forms of product-by-process claims include `` true '' product-by-process claims , product claims with a process limitation , product claims with a process-derived structural element , and product claims with functional terms . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Hruska Commission Report , which informed the debate that eventually led to the formation of our court , described the varying attitudes towards patents held by the regional courts of appeal and the variations in patent rulings among the circuits . See Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System Structure and Internal Procedures : Recommendations for Change , 67 F.R.D . 195 , 370 ( 1975 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The en banc court impugns the CCPA 's experience . Maj. op . at 1293 ( stating that the CCPA had `` virtually no jurisdiction to address infringement litigation '' ) . The CCPA for many years addressed infringement litigation , in appeals from the International Trade Commission and its predecessor tribunals . E.g. , Sealed Air Corp. v. Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 68 C.C.P.A . 93 , 645 F.2d 976 ( 1981 ) ( issues of validity and infringement ) ; Hale Fire Pump Co. v. Tokai , Ltd. , 67 C.C.P.A . 121 , 614 F.2d 1278 ( 1980 ) ( issues of validity , scope , and infringement ) ; In re Orion , 22 C.C.P.A . 149 , 71 F.2d 458 ( 1934 ) ( issues of jurisdiction and infringement ) . _NEWLINE_ Our predecessor 's legal and scholarly distinction in the field of patent law , and the high regard in which Congress and the innovation communities held the jurisprudence of the CCPA were a critical foundation for formation of the Federal Circuit and its charge to reinvigorate the role of the patent system in service to the nation 's technological innovation . See 125 Cong . Rec . 23,462 ( 1979 ) ( statement of Sen. DeConcini ) ( `` It is a reflection of high esteem which Congress has for the sitting judges of the Court of Claims and Court of Customs and Patent Appeals that these judges will become the first judges of the new Court of the Federal Circuit. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is curious to observe this en banc court extolling decisions of the regional circuits as authoritative , while it disregards the decisions of our predecessor courts and of this court . This court was created to remove patent law questions from the regional circuit courts . See H.R . Rep. 96-1300 , at 20 ( 1980 ) ( `` Directing patent appeals to the new court will have the beneficial effect of removing these unusually complex , technically difficult , and time-consuming cases from the dockets of the regional courts of appeals ... . [ T ] he central purpose is to reduce the widespread lack of uniformity and uncertainty of legal doctrine that exist in the administration of patent law . `` ) ; see also Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1979 : Hearings Before the Subcomm . on Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Comm . on the Judiciary , U.S. Senate , 96th Cong . 197 ( 1979 ) ( statement of Hon . Henry J . Friendly ) ( `` What is needed is a group of judges , some but not all patent lawyers , with scientific training and interest , aided both by law clerks of similar bent and by a staff of experts in a variety of technologies , such as the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has had for years and the courts of appeals in the very nature of things , can not ... '' ) . To cite two regional circuit decisions , while jettisoning the precedents of the court uniquely qualified to address patent questions and selected to supplant the regional circuits , is puzzling . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There has been extensive commentary on this class of claim .

's ( VA ) patent infringement lawsuit against Defendants pending post-grant review of the validity of VA 's asserted claims under the Transitional Program for Covered Business Method Patents ( CBM program ) . We reverse . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ In January 2013 , VA sued Defendants alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No . 8,095,413 ( '413 patent ) . On May 24 , 2013 , Salesforce filed a petition with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ( PTAB ) for post-grant review of all claims of the ¡¬413 patent under the CBM program . In the petition , Salesforce argued that all claims of the ¡¬413 patent were eligible for this form of post-grant review because they are directed *1309 to a `` covered business method patent '' within the meaning of ¡± 18 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the America Invents Act ( AIA ) , Pub L. No . 112-29 , 125 Stat . 284 , 329-31 ( 2011 ) , and that Salesforce had standing to bring the petition because it was sued for patent infringement , AIA ¡± 18 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) . Salesforce further argued the PTAB should institute CBM review because all the claims of the ¡¬413 patent were more likely than not patent-ineligible under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 101 and invalid under 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 102 , 103 in view of several prior art references . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On May 29 , 2013 , Defendants filed a motion to stay district court proceedings pursuant to AIA ¡± 18 ( b ) ( 1 ) . See Defendants ' Joint Motion To Stay Proceedings , Virtual-Agility Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 13-cv-00111 ( E.D.Tex . May 29 , 2013 ) , ECF No . 67 . In August 2013 , while this motion was pending , the district court issued a discovery order and held a scheduling conference , setting an April 2014 date for a claim construction hearing and a November 2014 date for jury selection . Also in August 2013 , VA filed a Preliminary Response in opposition to Salesforce 's petition at the PTAB pursuant to 37 C.F.R . ¡± 42.207 ( a ) . In November 2013 , the PTAB granted-in-part Salesforce 's petition based on its conclusion that all claims of the ¡¬413 patent are directed to a covered business method , and are more likely than not patent-ineligible under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 101 and invalid under ¡± 102 as anticipated by U.S. Patent No . 5,761,674 ( Ito ) . The PTAB also issued its own scheduling order , setting a July 2014 date for a trial on the validity of the ¡¬413 patent claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In early January 2014 , the district court denied Defendants ' motion to stay the case pending CBM review . VirtualAgility Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 13-cv-00111 , 2014 WL 94371 ( E.D.Tex . Jan. 9 , 2014 ) . Defendants timely filed an interlocutory appeal to this court , and also filed motions to stay district court proceedings pending the disposition of this appeal with the district court and this court . While these motions were pending , VA filed a Motion to Amend the ¡¬413 patent claims with the PTAB contingent on the claims ' invalidation . PTAB No . CBM2013-00024 , Paper 26 ( Jan. 28 , 2014 ) . In February , we issued an order staying proceedings in the district court pending our disposition of Defendants ' motion to stay pending appeal . VirtualAgility Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 14-1232 ( Fed.Cir . Feb. 12 , 2014 ) , ECF No . 34 . Pursuant to our order , the district court entered the stay pending appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ We have jurisdiction over this appeal under AIA ¡± 18 ( b ) ( 2 ) , which provides that `` [ a ] party may take an immediate interlocutory appeal from a district court 's decision '' granting or denying a motion to stay litigation pending CBM review . The statute instructs the district court to consider the following four factors when deciding whether to grant a stay : _NEWLINE_ ( A ) whether a stay , or the denial thereof , will simplify the issues in question and streamline the trial ; _NEWLINE_ ( B ) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has been set ; _NEWLINE_ ( C ) whether a stay , or the denial thereof , would unduly prejudice the nonmoving party or present a clear tactical advantage for the moving party ; and _NEWLINE_ ( D ) whether a stay , or the denial thereof , will reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and on the court . _NEWLINE_ AIA ¡± 18 ( b ) ( 1 ) . The statute further provides that we `` shall review the district court 's decision to ensure consistent application of established precedent , and such review may be de novo . '' Id . ¡± 18 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . Standard of Review _NEWLINE_ The parties dispute the standard of review that we should apply to this case . *1310 Defendants contend that the statute `` encourages full de novo review where factual evidence and conclusions of law are reviewed fully and independently . '' Appellant 's Br . 15 . VA responds that we should review the order denying a stay with deference because such decisions implicate district courts ' management of their own dockets , which is a matter traditionally left to their discretion . We note that prior to the AIA , district court decisions on motions to stay pending U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) proceedings were generally not appealable and , when they were , we reviewed them under the abuse of discretion standard . Procter & Gamble Co. v. Kraft Foods Global , Inc. , 549 F.3d 842 , 845 , 848-49 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ; see also Landis v. N. Am . Co. , 299 U.S. 248 , 254-55 , 57 S.Ct . 163 , 81 L.Ed . 153 ( 1936 ) ; Gould v. Control Laser Corp. , 705 F.2d 1340 , 1341 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . We also note that the AIA expressly created an immediate right of appeal of stay decisions pending CBM review , gave us jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeals , and that the only standard mentioned in the statute is de novo review . Nevertheless , we need not resolve this dispute because we hold that , even under the abuse of discretion standard argued for by VA , the district court 's decision to deny a stay pending the PTAB 's review of the ¡¬413 patent claims under the CBM program must be reversed . Nothing in this opinion should be read as deciding the standard of review applicable to the ultimate stay decision or the individual factors . We leave it to a future case to resolve what Congress meant when it indicated that our `` review may be de novo . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . Factors ( A ) and ( D ) : Simplification of Issues and Reduced Burden of Litigation _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that the first factor-simplification of the issues-was `` essentially neutral , if not slightly against '' granting a stay because it was `` not convinced '' by the PTAB 's assessment that cancellation of some or all of the claims during CBM review was `` probable . '' VirtualAgility , 2014 WL 94371 , at *2 , *5 . The district court reviewed the lengthy prosecution history that the ¡¬413 patent underwent before issuance . The court was persuaded that `` there can be little dispute here about the thoroughness of the PTO 's prior examination of the ¡¬413 patent , given the various grounds of invalidity and the breadth of prior art references considered by the PTO before issuing this patent . '' Id . at 3 . The court then performed its own evaluation of the bases upon which the PTAB granted the CBM petition . The court stated that , even though the Ito patent had never been before the PTO , it was not persuaded that Ito anticipates all of the claims given the PTO 's extensive review of other prior art during `` a lengthy prosecution process . '' Id . The court also concluded that the value of the PTAB 's consideration of Ito was `` marginal '' because Defendants introduced two other pieces of prior art in the district court proceedings-which , they represented , were `` of particular importance '' -that Salesforce did not include in its CBM petition . Id . With regard to the PTAB 's decision to review whether the ¡¬413 patent claims are patent-ineligible , the court observed that the claims were amended during prosecution to overcome an earlier ¡± 101 rejection . Based on its assessment of the claims and the law of ¡± 101 , the court `` was not persuaded that the PTAB will likely cancel all claims of the ¡¬ 413 patent '' as patent-ineligible . Id . at 4 . In spite of the PTAB 's grant of the CBM petition , finding that all the claims of the ¡¬413 patent were more likely than not invalid on two different grounds , the district court concluded that it was not convinced that the PTAB would cancel some or all of the ¡¬413 patent claims . The court further concluded that it was not convinced that the CBM review would simplify *1311 the issues in this case and that , therefore , this factor was `` neutral , if not slightly against , granting a stay . '' Id . at 5 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court determined that the parties ' arguments regarding the fourth factor-burden of litigation- '' substantially overlap '' with those presented under the first factor . It found that `` the specific circumstances in the instant case present only a limited possibility '' of a reduced burden on the court and the parties . Id . at 8 . The court therefore concluded that the fourth factor `` weighs only slightly in favor of a stay . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After the court denied the motion for a stay , VA filed proposed claim amendments in the CBM review . Defendants filed a motion to , at least , stay district court proceedings pending appeal of the denial of the motion to stay . Defendants argued that the fact that VA has already filed a motion to amend claims in the CBM proceeding increased the likelihood that the CBM proceeding will simplify issues . In its decision denying the motion to stay pending appeal , the court observed that VA 's proposed amendments to the ¡¬413 patent claims in the CBM proceeding were not a part of the record at the time of its decision on the motion now on appeal . See VirtualAgility Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 13-cv-00111 , 2014 WL 807588 ( E.D.Tex . Feb. 27 , 2014 ) . On the merits , the court concluded that Defendants `` made no attempt at showing how ... conditions triggering the amendments would likely arise '' and have not `` challenged [ its ] previous finding that cancellation of some or all the claims was unlikely . '' Id . at 2 . The court also noted that , `` [ t ] o the extent any further statements [ by VA ] or amendments to claims may affect [ its ] claim construction , such is fully remediable with supplemental claim constructions . '' Id . at 3 . Thus , the court concluded that the fact that VA moved to amend the claims in the CBM proceeding did not affect its determination regarding the first and fourth factors . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Defendants contend that the district court made `` critical errors '' in finding the first factor neutral or slightly against the stay . Defendants argue that CBM review will simplify and streamline issues for trial because the district court would not need to address any claims that are cancelled and because Defendants will be estopped from challenging the validity of the ¡¬ 413 patent in view of ¡± 101 and the Ito patent after the review is concluded.2 Defendants further argue that claim amendments during CBM review may eliminate infringement arguments and give rise to intervening rights . They contend that the district court should not have second-guessed the PTAB 's conclusion that all ¡¬413 patent claims are `` more likely than not '' anticipated by Ito and invalid under ¡± 101 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Defendants also argue that the fourth factor likewise strongly favors a stay because CBM review may spare Salesforce 's customers , who have also been sued by VA , from discovery , while `` the true parties in interest '' focus on the validity of the ¡¬413 patent at the PTAB . They argue that a stay will further reduce discovery burdens on third parties . Finally , they contend that the district court erred by conflating the fourth factor with the first factor and by giving it too little weight . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VA counters that a stay will not significantly simplify this case or reduce the *1312 burden on the court and the parties . As an initial matter , VA contends that we should not take into account its Motion to Amend because it was not a part of the record below . VA asserts that , while the motion to stay litigation pending CBM review was pending , it told Defendants that it might move to amend the claims . It contends that , because Defendants did not notify the district court about VA 's possible amendments , they waived any argument about the Motion to Amend . On the merits , VA points out that the motion seeks to amend only seven of the twenty-one asserted claims and that the amendments may not necessarily be entered for any of the claims . It contends that the proposed amendments merely clarify the claim language and are not related to claim construction disputes currently before the district court , and thus would not significantly impact the litigation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VA also argues that a stay is unlikely to meaningfully simplify the case because invalidity issues not before the PTAB , as well as infringement and damages issues , will remain as long as a single claim survives CBM review . It contends the PTAB 's ¡± 101 review is also unlikely to simplify the case because patent-eligibility analysis is generally not resource-intensive . VA contends that the district court 's conclusion that the claims would likely survive the PTAB 's scrutiny was reasonable based on its assessment of ¡± 101 law . Further , VA argues that there is a `` palpable risk '' that we would vacate the PTAB 's decision to initiate CBM review of the ¡¬413 patent under the Administrative Procedure Act ( APA ) because it is not a `` covered business method patent '' within the meaning of ¡± 18 ( d ) ( 1 ) of the AIA . It argues that Defendants ' assertion that PTAB review would simplify litigation is contrary to trial court experience , and that the district court therefore properly rejected Defendants ' `` generic '' arguments that a stay pending CBM review would promote efficient adjudication in this case . VA contends that Salesforce 's arguments about its customer defendants and third parties were not properly preserved for appeal . It argues that , in any event , the customers are the true parties in interest because they partner with Salesforce , and that a stay would not reduce a burden on third parties because most third-party discovery has already taken place . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that it is proper for us to consider the fact that VA filed a Motion to Amend in our review of the district court 's decision . Defendants did not waive the arguments regarding claim amendments . They argued to the district court that claim amendments during PTAB review are a distinct possibility and , in doing so , gave VA an opportunity to respond to this argument below . Defendants ' Joint Motion To Stay Proceedings at 7-8 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We also conclude that we are not improperly expanding the record on appeal if we consider the Motion to Amend . See Moore U.S.A. , Inc. v. Standard Register Co. , 229 F.3d 1091 , 1116 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( citing Fed . R.App . P. 10 ( a ) ) . We are mindful that `` [ a ] n appellate court may consider only the record as it was made before the district court . '' Ballard Med . Prods . v. Wright , 821 F.2d 642 , 643 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ; see also Sage Prods. , Inc. v. Devon Indus. , Inc. , 126 F.3d 1420 , 1426 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( `` No matter how independent an appellate court 's review of an issue may be , it is still no more than that-a review. '' ) . Nevertheless , pursuant to Rule 201 ( b ) ( 2 ) of the Federal Rules of Evidence , we may take judicial notice of the fact that a filing was made before the PTAB . See , e.g. , Genentech , Inc. v. Chiron Corp. , 112 F.3d 495 , 497 n. 1 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ( noting that , because the `` record before the Board is a public record ... and thus capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to unquestionable sources , '' judicial *1313 notice was appropriate ) . Cognizant of the limits imposed by Rule 201 ( b ) ( 2 ) , however , we reiterate that we consider only the fact that a Motion to Amend was filed-not the impact of the proposed amendments on the parties ' claim construction and infringement arguments . The latter can not be `` accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned . '' Fed.R.Evid . 201 ( b ) ( 2 ) . Moreover , the district court 's ability to address the Motion to Amend in its ruling denying a stay of its proceedings pending appeal supports our consideration of the fact that VA filed proposed claim amendments because we are not faced with the uncomfortable task of doing so for the first time on appeal . Cf . Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U.S. 106 , 121 , 96 S.Ct . 2868 , 49 L.Ed.2d 826 ( 1976 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Another preliminary issue concerns the relationship between the first and fourth factors . We agree with the district court that there is a great deal of overlap between the parties ' arguments with regard to these two factors . We note , however , that the simplification of the issues factor and the burden of litigation factor are listed separately in the statute . Thus , even when both factors point in the same direction-in favor of or against the stay-they continue to be separate , individual factors which must be weighed in the stay determination . We can not , as VA requests , collapse the four-factor test expressly adopted by Congress into a three-factor test . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that the first factor was neutral or slightly against a stay , and that the fourth factor weighed only slightly in favor of a stay . We hold that these factors strongly favor a stay in this case . The district court erred as a matter of law to the extent that it decided to `` review '' the PTAB 's determination that the claims of the ¡¬413 patent are more likely than not invalid in the posture of a ruling on a motion to stay . Under the statutory scheme , district courts have no role in reviewing the PTAB 's determinations regarding the patentability of claims that are subject to CBM proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Indeed , a challenge to the PTAB 's `` more likely than not '' determination at this stage amounts to an improper collateral attack on the PTAB 's decision to institute CBM review , and allowing it would create serious practical problems . As a preliminary matter , Congress made post-grant review more difficult to obtain than reexamination by raising the standard from `` a substantial new question of patentability , '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 303 ( a ) ( 2012 ) , to `` more likely than not ... unpatentable , '' id . ¡± 324 ( a ) . Congress clearly did not intend district courts to hold mini-trials reviewing the PTAB 's decision on the merits of the CBM review . To do so would overwhelm and dramatically expand the nature of the stay determination . If the district court were required to `` review '' the merits of the PTAB 's decision to institute a CBM proceeding as part of its stay determination , it would undermine the purpose of the stay . When the stay decision is then appealed to this court , we would be required to likewise review the PTAB 's decision to institute a CBM proceeding . This is clearly not how or when Congress intended review of the PTAB 's CBM determinations to take place . See id . ¡± 141 ( c ) ( `` A party to ... a post-grant review who is dissatisfied with the final written decision of the [ PTAB ] ... may appeal the Board 's decision only to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. '' ) . The stay determination is not the time or the place to review the PTAB 's decisions to institute a CBM proceeding.3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1314 The district court 's decision regarding the first and fourth factors was based predominantly on its improper review of whether the PTAB was correct in its determination that the claims of the ¡¬413 patent were more likely than not invalid . After this review is removed from the calculus , the remaining evidence of record weighs heavily in favor of a stay . We find it significant that the PTAB granted CBM review on all asserted claims of the sole asserted patent . And it determined that all of these claims were more likely than not unpatentable on two separate , alternative grounds . The statute allows for institution of post-grant review if `` it is more likely than not that at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition is unpatentable . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 324 ( a ) . In this case , the PTAB expressly determined that all of the claims are more likely than not unpatentable . This CBM review could dispose of the entire litigation : the ultimate simplification of issues . See Broad . Innovation , L.L.C . v. Charter Commc'ns Inc. , No . 03-cv-2233 , 2006 WL 1897165 , at *8 ( D.Colo . July 11 , 2006 ) ( noting that `` a stay would further the interests of judicial economy and the conservation of the parties ' resources , as well as that of the court '' if a reexamination would `` dispose of ... litigation entirely '' ) ; cf . Procter & Gamble Co. v. Team Techs. , Inc. , 12-cv-552 , 2014 WL 533494 , at *4 ( S.D.Ohio Feb. 11 , 2014 ) ( denying a motion to stay and noting that `` in addition to the 11 claims that Plaintiff has asserted in this case that are also at issue in the [ inter partes review proceedings ] , the remaining 16 asserted claims are not at issue in any [ inter partes review ] '' ) ; Cognex Corp. v. Nat ' l Instruments Corp. , No . 00-442 , 2001 WL 34368283 , at *2 ( D.Del . June 29 , 2001 ) ( denying a stay pending reexamination in part because the complaint alleged `` a variety of claims which are not linked to the patent infringement claim , including claims of copyright and trademark infringement and unfair competition , all of which require a trial '' ) . This weighs heavily in favor of granting the stay . We reach this conclusion without needing to consider the fact that VA moved in the CBM proceeding to amend claims of the ¡¬413 patent . This fact , if considered , could only weigh further in favor of granting the stay so as to avoid unnecessary claim construction of what could potentially be a moving target in terms of claim language . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VA 's position that Salesforce 's decision to save two pieces of its important prior art for district court proceedings instead of placing it before the PTAB has reduced efficiencies is not without support . The simplification argument would be stronger if all of the prior art or relevant invalidity issues were in the CBM review , as this would entirely eliminate the trial court 's need to consider validity in the event that some claims survive CBM review . In this case , however , where CBM review has been granted on all claims of the only patent at issue , the simplification factor weighs heavily in favor of the stay . If Salesforce is successful , and the PTAB has concluded that it `` more likely than not '' will be , then there would be no need for the district court to consider the other two prior art references . This would not just reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and the court-it would entirely eliminate it.4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1315 Failure to include other known prior art in the CBM petition could , as we will discuss below , create a potential tactical advantage for Defendants that would weigh against a stay under the third factor . Cf . Gladish v. Tyco Toys , Inc. , 29 U.S.P.Q.2d ( BNA ) 1718 , 1720 , 1993 WL 625509 , at *2 ( E.D.Cal.1993 ) ( observing that the district court `` is the only forum for a complete consideration of [ the defendant 's ] evidence of invalidity '' and noting that this fact disfavors a stay pending reexamination ) ; see also Enprotech Corp. v. Autotech Corp. , 15 U.S.P.Q.2d ( BNA ) 1319 , 1320 , 1990 WL 37217 , at *1 ( N.D.Ill.1990 ) . We also agree with VA that Defendants ' arguments regarding customers and third parties were not raised before the district court and are therefore waived . Nevertheless , on balance of the evidence in the record , we conclude that the first and fourth factors heavily favor a stay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . Factor ( B ) : Whether Discovery Is Complete and Whether a Trial Date Has Been Set _NEWLINE_ The court found that the timing factor favored granting a stay because the parties had not yet filed their joint claim construction statement , the deadline to complete fact discovery was more than six months away , and jury selection was not until November 2014 . VirtualAgility , 2014 WL 94371 , at *5 ; see Docket Control Order , VirtualAgility Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 13-cv-00111 ( E.D.Tex . Aug. 30 , 2013 ) , ECF No . 91 . But it concluded that `` the benefits of a stay at this relatively early stage of the proceedings are outweighed by various other considerations as discussed elsewhere herein . '' VirtualAgility , 2014 WL 94371 , at *5 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Defendants argue that the district court correctly concluded that the early stage of the litigation favors a stay . Defendants contend , however , that the district court did not weigh this factor heavily enough in favor of the stay because it erroneously considered the case 's status at the time it ruled on the motion rather than at the time when the motion was filed-seven months earlier . They argue that , when considering a motion to stay , it does not make sense for a district court to take into account its added familiarity with the case developed during the pendency of the motion . Defendants note that , at the time of the filing , there was no date for jury selection and no discovery had taken place . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VA counters that the district court correctly evaluated the status of the case on the date when it ruled on the motion rather than when the motion was filed because there was no indication that the PTAB would initiate CBM review when Defendants moved for a stay . VA notes that , at the time the district court ruled on the motion to stay , the parties were involved in fact discovery and were preparing for a claim construction hearing , which , it contends , indicates that the case was at an advanced stage . VA thus argues that the timing factor is neutral . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We hold that the timing factor heavily favors a stay . We note at the outset that it was not error for the district court to wait until the PTAB made its decision to institute CBM review before it ruled on the motion . Indeed , while some district courts ruled on motions to stay before the PTAB granted the petition for post-grant review , see , e.g. , Intertainer , Inc. v. Hulu , LLC , No . 13-cv-5499 , 2014 WL 466034 , at *1 ( C.D.Cal . Jan. 24 , 2014 ) , others have *1316 waited until post-grant review was instituted , and still others denied as premature the motion to stay without prejudice to refiling after institution of post-grant review , see , e.g. , Checkfree Corp. v. Metavante Corp. , No . 12-cv-15 , 2014 WL 466023 , at *1 ( M.D.Fla . Jan. 17 , 2014 ) . We express no opinion on which is the better practice . While a motion to stay could be granted even before the PTAB rules on a post-grant review petition , no doubt the case for a stay is stronger after post-grant review has been instituted . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , the stay motion was filed in May 2013 , almost immediately after Salesforce had filed its CBM petition with the PTAB . The PTAB granted the petition in November 2013 . The district court denied the motion to stay in January 2014 . As noted above , we see no error in the district court 's decision to rule on the stay motion after the PTAB rendered its decision on the CBM petition . Furthermore , a district court is not obligated to `` freeze '' its proceedings between the date that the motion to stay is filed and the date that the PTAB decides on the CBM petition . Of course , the court should make every effort to expeditiously resolve the stay motion after the PTAB has made its CBM review determination . To do otherwise would undermine the intent of Congress to allow for stays to prevent unnecessary duplication of proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As for the proper time to measure the stage of litigation , district courts have adopted the date of the filing of the motion to stay . See , e.g. , Norred v. Medtronic , Inc. , No . 13-2061 , 2014 WL 554685 , at *2 ( D.Kan . Feb. 12 , 2014 ) ( `` The Court finds that this case is still in its early stages , with the Scheduling Order entered only a few months before this motion was filed . `` ) ; Cynosure , Inc. v. Cooltouch Inc. , No . 08-10026 , 2009 WL 2462565 , at *2 ( D.Mass . Aug. 10 , 2009 ) ( `` The most compelling justification for denying defendant 's motion to stay is the stage of the litigation at which it was filed . '' ) ( emphasis added ) ; Agar Corp. Inc. v. Multi-Fluid , Inc. , 983 F.Supp . 1126 , 1127 ( S.D.Tex.1997 ) ( articulating the timing factor as `` the stage of the litigation at which the motion was filed '' ) . The cases cited by the dissent are not to the contrary and do not hold that the stage of litigation is measured as of any date other than the date of the motion.5 In two of the cases cited by the dissent , the motion was decided within weeks of its filing , and thus the stage of litigation discussed was effectively the stage of the filing of the motion . Rensselaer Polytech . Inst . v. Apple Inc. , No . 13-cv-0633 , 2014 WL 201965 , at *5 ( N.D.N.Y . Jan. 15 , 2014 ) ( motion to stay filed in December 2013 ) ; TPK Touch Solutions , Inc. v. Wintek Electro-Optics Corp. , No . 13-cv-2218 , 2013 WL 6021324 , at *4-5 ( N.D.Cal . Nov. 13 , 2013 ) ( motion to stay filed in late September 2013 ) . In the third case , it is clear that the district court used the time of the filing of the motion for a stay to evaluate the stage of litigation . Boston Scientific Corp. v. Cordis Corp. , 777 F.Supp.2d 783 ( D.Del.2011 ) . The court explained that the stage of litigation cuts against a stay because discovery is complete and the trial is scheduled to commence in May 2011 . Id . at 788 . Although it is not apparent from this portion of the opinion at what time the stage of litigation was measured , the district court later made clear that it looked at the time of the filing of the motion : `` Cordis ' motion for *1317 stay was filed on September 23 , 2010 , nearly one year after the untimely request for reexamination was made . As noted above [ in the 'Status of litigation ' section ] , a trial date had been set and fact discovery was complete at the time Cordis filed its motion for stay . '' Id . at 789 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Generally , the time of the motion is the relevant time to measure the stage of litigation.6 In this case , we see no error in the district court 's having waited until the PTAB granted the CBM review to rule upon the motion . Whether we consider the May 2013 date , when the motion to stay was filed , or the November 2013 date , when the PTAB granted CBM review , this factor heavily favors Defendants . At the time Defendants filed their motion in May 2013 , the case was less than four months old . Discovery had not yet begun and no trial date had been set . As of the date the PTAB granted CBM review , there remained eight months of fact discovery , the joint claim construction statements had yet to be filed , and jury selection was a year away . The litigation at either time was still at its infancy , which favors granting the stay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . Factor ( C ) : Undue Prejudice or Tactical Advantage _NEWLINE_ The district court concluded that the undue prejudice factor weighed heavily against a stay . It found that , given `` credible evidence '' that VA and Salesforce were direct competitors , VA would suffer irreparable harm in the form of lost market share and consumer goodwill stemming from the delay in enforcing its patent rights . VirtualAgility , 2014 WL 94371 , at *6 . The court noted that , for example , VA and Salesforce `` took part in the same government bid process at least once . '' Id . It determined that , even though CBM review must conclude by November 2014 ( i.e. , one year from institution of the proceeding , see 35 U.S.C . ¡± 326 ( a ) ( 11 ) ) ,7 VA would still suffer undue prejudice because it is a small company with limited resources and because a likely appeal would impose further delay . The court also found that VA would be unduly prejudiced `` because certain identified witnesses are of an advanced age . '' Id . at 7 . Finally , the court refused to weigh the fact that VA did not move for a preliminary injunction against VA , stating that it was not `` in a role to judge the parties ' litigation strategy . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Defendants argue that the district court erred in concluding that a stay would unduly prejudice VA . They contend that VA will not suffer undue prejudice because the timeframe for CBM review is short . They argue that , in any event , mere delay in having one 's claim adjudicated does not constitute undue prejudice . Defendants argue that VA has not identified any actual risk of fading memories or potentially unavailable evidence . Defendants further contend that VA could be adequately compensated by money damages . They argue that the district court clearly erred in finding that VA and Salesforce competed for the same bid , and that VA has not proven that it would lose market share or goodwill due to a delay in the resolution of its *1318 infringement case . Defendants contend that the fact that VA did not move for a preliminary injunction suggests that VA is not truly concerned about a delay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VA counters that a delay will subject it to undue prejudice by significantly harming its business . It argues that the fate of the ¡¬413 patent claims would almost certainly not be known until after the statutory November 2014 deadline because of the likely appeal of the PTAB 's decision and due to other potential delays . It contends that Defendants ' argument that VA and Salesforce are not true competitors is meritless in view of record evidence that the two companies compete in the same market . VA argues that expeditious enforcement of its patent rights against larger competitors like Salesforce is critical to protecting its market share , and that a permanent injunction would thus be `` very likely '' if it succeeded in proving infringement . Appellee 's Br . 48 . It further argues that the district court 's fast schedule made it unnecessary to move for a preliminary injunction . Finally , VA contends that the district court did not err in concluding that loss of evidence during the pendency of CBM review is likely and that , regardless , Defendants waived the argument that loss of evidence was not a concern . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that the undue prejudice factor weighed heavily against a stay . At best , this factor weighs slightly against a stay . We agree with the district court that competition between parties can weigh in favor of finding undue prejudice . See , e.g. , Market-Alerts Pty . Ltd. v. Bloomberg Fin . L.P. , 922 F.Supp.2d 486 , 494-95 ( D.Del.2013 ) . There is evidence in this record that Salesforce and VA are in the same business space . The record indicates that Salesforce provides cloud-based enterprise-level information technology solutions , J.A . 339 , 344 , and so does VA , J.A . 315-16 . In addition , both companies target public-sector customers . J.A . 316-17 , 323-27 . But as to evidence of direct competition , the record establishes only that Salesforce was mentioned in a Government Services Administration ( GSA ) bid , which VA received , identifying Salesforce 's products as the brand name reference products . J.A . 316 , 322-37 . VA admitted during oral argument , however , that this GSA bid was a small business set-aside , for which Salesforce , a large business , could not compete . J.A . 322 ; Oral Argument at 24:19-25:32 , available at http : //oralarguments . cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl & 2014-1232.mp3 . Thus , there is no evidence in this record that the two companies ever competed for the same customer or contract . We acknowledge , however , that direct evidence of such competition is not required to establish that VA and Salesforce are competitors , especially at such an early stage of the proceedings . See Moleculon Research Corp. v. CBS , Inc. , 793 F.2d 1261 , 1271 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) , abrogated on other grounds by Egyptian Goddess , Inc. v. Swisa , Inc. , 543 F.3d 665 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( en banc ) ( `` [ D ] irect evidence of a fact is not necessary. '' ) . We do credit the district court 's finding that loss of market share and consumer goodwill is high in the growing market of cloud-computing . See VirtualAgility , 2014 WL 94371 , at *6 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Of course , whether the patentee will be unduly prejudiced by a stay in the district court proceedings during the CBM review , like the irreparable harm-type inquiry , focuses on the patentee 's need for an expeditious resolution of its claim . A stay will not diminish the monetary damages to which VA will be entitled if it succeeds in its infringement suit-it only delays realization of those damages and delays any potential injunctive remedy . VA argues that it needs injunctive relief as soon as possible to prevent irreparable harm to its business , indicating that even a one-to *1319 two-year delay in the adjudication of its infringement claims would subject it to undue prejudice because VA and Salesforce compete in the same market . See Appellee 's Br . 49-50 ; VA 's Response in Opposition to Defendants ' Joint Motion To Stay Proceedings Pursuant to Section 18 ( b ) of the America Invents Act at 10-11 , VirtualAgilityc Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 13-cv-00111 ( E.D.Tex . June 20 , 2013 ) , ECF No . 72 . Although this is not dispositive , we note that VA did not move for a preliminary injunction against Defendants . We acknowledge , as the district court did , that there could be a variety of reasons that a patentee does not move for a preliminary injunction . See , e.g. , Nippon Steel & Sumito Metal Corp. v. POSCO , No . 12-2429 , 2013 WL 1867042 , at *6 n. 6 ( D.N.J . May 2 , 2013 ) ; Nat ' l Prods. , Inc. v. Gamber-Johnson LLC , 12-cv-00840 , 2012 WL 3527938 , at *3 n. 5 ( W.D.Wash . Aug. 14 , 2012 ) ; Cooper Notification , Inc. v. Twitter , Inc. , No . 09-865 , 2010 WL 5149351 , at *4 ( D.Del . Dec. 13 , 2010 ) ; see also U.S. Magistrate Judge Morton Denlow , The Motion for a Preliminary Injunction : Time for a Uniform Federal Standard , 22 Rev . Lit . 495 , 534 ( 2003 ) . In this case , VA argues that it did not move for a preliminary injunction because it is a small company with limited resources and that the litigation process would move fast enough to make this unnecessary . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VA 's arguments are rational reasons for not pursuing a preliminary injunction , but the fact that it was not worth the expense to ask for this remedy contradicts VA 's assertion that it needs injunctive relief as soon as possible . We also note that VA , for some unexplained reason , waited nearly a year after the ¡¬413 patent issued before it filed suit against Defendants . These facts weigh against VA 's claims that it will be unduly prejudiced by a stay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To the extent that the district court found that `` the added risk of witness loss '' could unduly prejudice plaintiff , we do not agree that this record supports a conclusion of undue prejudice . VA asserts that one potentially relevant witness is `` over 60 '' and three others are `` over 70 . '' Since when did 60 become so old ? It is undoubtedly true , as many courts have observed , that with age and the passage of time , memories may fade and witnesses may become unavailable . Without more , however , these assertions here are not sufficient to justify a conclusion of undue prejudice . There is no evidence that any of these individuals are in ill health , and at least one of the older witnesses has already been deposed . In addition , Rule 27 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows for the perpetuation of testimony when facts suggest that such action may be necessary . This rule gives district courts the authority to grant a petition authorizing a deposition to perpetuate testimony even before a lawsuit has been brought , and also applies when a case is otherwise stayed . See Texaco , Inc. v. Borda , 383 F.2d 607 , 609 ( 3d Cir.1967 ) ( concerns over advanced age of a witness could be alleviated by permitting a deposition to preserve testimony , and did not prevent a stay ) . The advanced age of witnesses is a factor relevant to potential prejudice , but the prejudice can be reduced , when necessary , by preserving the testimony . We conclude that this record does not support the conclusion that VA would be unduly prejudiced by the stay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , the district court did not find that a stay would give Defendants a clear tactical advantage , and we agree . There is no evidence that Defendants possessed a `` dilatory motive , '' which would have pointed against a stay . See , e.g. , Market-Alerts , 922 F.Supp.2d at 495-96 . In fact , Salesforce filed its CBM petition less than four months after VA instituted this infringement action and moved to stay the district court proceedings almost immediately *1320 after filing the petition . To the district court , VA argued that Salesforce `` could have used but deliberately and tactically withheld from the post-grant proceeding '' the so-called `` Oracle Projects '' prior art . VA 's Response in Opposition to Defendants ' Joint Motion To Stay Proceedings at 1 . Defendants responded that Salesforce did not include Oracle Projects in the CBM petition because it is `` a proprietary software system , not strictly a printed publication of the type typically considered by the PTO , '' and would require testimony from `` live third party witnesses at trial . '' Defendants ' Reply In Support of Motion To Stay at 4 , VirtualAgility Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 13-cv-00111 ( E.D.Tex . July 1 , 2013 ) , ECF No . 74 . Defendants also indicated that they had difficulties in obtaining evidence in connection with another piece of prior art `` of particular importance '' not used in CBM review , `` Tecskor product , '' necessitating a letter of request for international judicial assistance from Canada from the district court . Oral Argument at 42:13-45:26 , available at http : //oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx ? fl & 2014-1232 . mp3 ; VirtualAgility Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 13-cv-00111 ( E.D.Tex . Nov. 7 , 2013 ) , ECF No . 104 ; see VirtualAgility , 2014 WL 94371 , at *3 . In some circumstances , a defendant 's decision to save key pieces of prior art for district court litigation in case its CBM challenge fails would weigh against a stay . Even though the `` splitting '' of prior art is allowed by statute in the sense that litigation estoppel does not attach to art that could have been , but was not , raised in CBM review , such behavior can still give the movant a clear tactical advantage within the meaning of ¡± 18.8 This record does not establish such a clear tactical advantage given the uncontradicted evidence that , at the time Salesforce filed its CBM petition , it did not have the evidence necessary to include the Oracle Projects and Tecskor prior art . Given these unusual circumstances , we conclude that there is no clear tactical advantage to Defendants of granting the stay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On this record , the evidence of competition is weak and the patentee 's delays in pursuing suit and seeking preliminary injunctive relief belie its claims that it will be unduly prejudiced by a stay . We conclude that the district court clearly erred in concluding that undue prejudice here weighs heavily against granting the stay . At best , under the clear error standard , this factor weighs slightly against a stay on this record . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * * * * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Three of the four factors weigh heavily in favor of a stay in this case : simplification of the issues and streamlining of the trial , whether discovery is complete and a trial date has been set , and reduction of the burden of litigation on the parties and the court . The undue prejudice factor , at best , weighs slightly in favor of denying a stay . On this record , we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it denied the stay . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ We reverse the district court 's order denying Defendants ' motion for a stay of the district court proceedings pending CBM review and remand with instructions to grant the motion . This decision moots Defendants ' motion to stay district court proceedings pending appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1321 COSTS _NEWLINE_ No costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ NEWMAN , Circuit Judge , dissenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The America Invents Act permits but does not require the district court to stay earlier-filed litigation during later-requested post-grant PTO proceedings . Such a stay is not obligatory , but is consigned to the district court 's discretion . During consideration of the proposed post-grant review legislation , there was extensive debate about the relation between concurrent infringement actions in the courts and post-grant patentability redeterminations in the PTO . After eight years of discussion , the America Invents Act adopted rules for concurrent proceedings in various circumstances . No statute or rule requires the district court to stay ongoing court proceedings after a petition for post-grant review is filed in the PTO . My colleagues ' contrary ruling today is also contrary to the legislation and its purpose . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The decision of a trial judge not to stay an infringement action in litigation , when the defendant requests a stay but the plaintiff wishes to proceed , is consigned to the discretion of the judge . Here the plaintiff objected to the stay and the district court exercised its discretion and denied the stay . Nonetheless my colleagues reverse the district court and grant the stay , although it is not shown that the district court abused its discretion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court may choose to stay its proceedings when the interest of justice warrants , and the AIA lists several factors for the court to consider in deciding how to exercise its discretion in a particular case . However , a stay of litigation is not available as a matter of right when a petition for post-grant review is filed in the PTO.1 See Commodity Futures Trading Comm ' n v. Schor , 478 U.S. 833 , 850 , 106 S.Ct . 3245 , 92 L.Ed.2d 675 ( 1986 ) ( `` Article III , ¡± 1 preserves to litigants their interest in an impartial and independent federal adjudication of claims within the judicial power of the United States ... . '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , the district court applied the traditional stay factors as recorded in AIA Section 18 ( b ) , and ruled that stay of the ongoing judicial proceeding was inappropriate . The district court exercised its discretion to continue with the trial , which was on a fast track to completion . This ruling is well within the district court 's statutory and discretionary authority . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although the Covered Business Method ( CBM ) statute provides that appellate review of a district court 's decision to grant or deny a stay `` may be de novo , '' when the district court 's decision is within its range of discretion , it warrants appellate respect . My colleagues on this panel do not identify any abuse of the district court 's discretion ; nor do they acknowledge the deference owed to a trial judge in rulings on matters of equity and the balance of interests . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I respectfully dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ A stay is an `` intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review , and accordingly is not a matter of right , even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the appellant . '' Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418 , 427 , 129 S.Ct . 1749 , 173 L.Ed.2d 550 ( 2009 ) . Section 18 ( b ) ( 1 ) of the America Invents Act authorizes the district court to stay the litigation of a patent for which CBM review in the PTO has been requested . Such a stay is not *1322 automatic ; the statute authorizes the district court in its discretion to stay its proceedings , on taking into account certain equitable factors as may exist in the particular case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In today 's ruling the panel majority overrides the district court 's discretion , and effectively creates a rule that stays of district court litigation pending CBM review must always be granted . Here the district court carefully considered the four factors set out in the statute , and concluded that VirtualAgility is likely to be harmed disproportionately in both the litigation and the marketplace if the defendants are allowed to draw out this case for an extended period , all the while continuing to infringe a presumptively valid patent . The district court considered the phase of the litigation , the completion of document production and much of discovery , and the early trial date , and exercised its discretion to proceed with the trial proceedings . Whether or not my colleagues ' prolongation of the dispute by way of a potential multiplicity of administrative trials and appeals can be defended , the district court 's evaluation of the equities is reasonable , is consistent with the analyses by other district courts , and warrants deference . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The near automatic grant of litigation stays today engrafted onto the statute tilts the legislated balance , for the statute recognized that a stay pending CBM review may , depending on the circumstances , lead to inequity and tactical abuse . See Tuitionfund , LLC v. SunTrust Banks , Inc. , 2012 WL 4758382 , at *1 ( M.D.Tenn . Oct. 5 , 2012 ) ( `` Further , there may be tactical advantages to the Vesdia Defendants in seeking a stay , the most apparent being delay . `` ) ; Bausch & Lomb Inc. v. Rexall Sundown , Inc. , 554 F.Supp.2d 386 , 389 ( W.D.N.Y.2008 ) ( `` Resort to the reexamination procedure should not be sanctioned through the issuance of a stay , however , where it is pursued for tactical advantage after substantial and costly discovery has been conducted or where trial is imminent. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Successive proceedings can add extensive delay to final resolution , while the patent life continues to expiration . The district court emphasized the heavy impact of delay on this patentee . Deference is owed to the district court 's assessment , for the trial court is in a better position than either the PTO , or this court , to attune a request for stay to the particular situation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court has discretionary authority to manage its cases , as well as to consider equitable factors . The Supreme Court has recognized this authority , see Landis v. North American Co. , 299 U.S. 248 , 254-55 , 57 S.Ct . 163 , 81 L.Ed . 153 ( 1936 ) ( discussing power and circumstances of stay of proceedings , stating that : `` Only in rare circumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand aside while a litigant in another settles the rule of law that will define the rights of both . `` ) , as has the Federal Circuit , see Viskase Corp. v. American National Can Co. , 261 F.3d 1316 , 1328 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( `` The court is not required to stay judicial resolution in view of the reexaminations. '' ) . Indeed , the party appealing denial of a stay historically faced a steeper burden because the appeal seeks `` interference by an appellate court with management of proceedings entrusted to the district court . '' Gould v. Control Laser Corp. , 705 F.2d 1340 , 1341 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Congress did not change this precedent in the America Invents Act , when it directed the courts to apply the established precedent of litigation stays to the vast variety of possible situations in overlapping district court and PTO post-grant proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In *1323 Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt . Sys. , Inc. , -- - U.S. -- -- , 134 S.Ct . 1744 , 188 L.Ed.2d 829 ( 2014 ) , the Supreme Court discussed the rationale for abuse of discretion review in the context of the Patent Act 's fee-shifting provisions . The Court stated that as a matter of the sound administration of justice , the district court is better positioned to decide whether a case is exceptional because it has lived with the case over a prolonged period . The Court observed that the fee shifting question is `` multifarious and novel , '' and not susceptible to `` useful generalization '' of the sort that de novo review provides , but is more `` likely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of-discretion rule will permit to develop . '' Id . at 1748-49 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Court 's reasoning in Highmark applies forcefully to a district court 's exercise of discretion in deciding whether to stay pending litigation despite the patentee 's objection . The inquiry created by the AIA 's four factor test is highly fact specific , not susceptible to `` useful generalization ; '' the district court is better positioned to decide whether a stay serves the best balance of interests of the parties and the court . My colleagues on this panel ignore this reality . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Depending on the stage of the litigation , as the AIA provides , a court may conclude , within its discretion , that `` the principle of maximizing the use of judicial and litigant resources is best served by seeing the case through to its conclusion . '' Mkt.-Alerts Pty . Ltd. v. Bloomberg Fin . L.P. , 922 F.Supp.2d 486 , 494 ( D.Del.2013 ) . Several courts have expressed concern that a stay will interfere with their ability to manage their dockets and fulfill their judicial responsibilities . For example , in response to a requested stay pending reexamination , a district court recently stated : _NEWLINE_ The Court is concerned that allowing the progress of its docket to depend on the status of proceedings elsewhere can interfere with its obligation `` to secure the just , speedy , and inexpensive determination of every action . '' Fed.R.Civ.P . 1 . `` If litigation were stayed every time a claim in suit undergoes reexamination , federal infringement actions would be dogged by fits and starts . Federal court calendars should not be hijacked in this manner . '' Comcast Cable Commc'ns Corp. , LLC v. Finisar Corp. , No . C 06-04206 WHA , 2007 WL 1052883 , at *1 ( N.D.Cal . Apr . 5 , 2007 ) . This consideration weighs against a stay . _NEWLINE_ Universal Elecs. , Inc. v. Universal Remote Control , Inc. , 943 F.Supp.2d 1028 , 1035 ( C.D.Cal.2013 ) . The panel majority does not acknowledge these concerns . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AIA Section 18 ( b ) lists four factors relevant to evaluation of a stay request . In this case the district court conscientiously applied this framework , and on consideration of the nature of the patent , this case 's trial schedule , and the competitive relationship between the parties , the court concluded that the potential benefits of a stay are outweighed by the harm that VirtualAgility is likely to experience , in both the litigation and the marketplace , if a stay were granted . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court 's analysis of the four factors represents a consistent application of precedent , and neither the appellants nor the panel majority have shown that the balance reached by the court is an abuse of discretion . I briefly review the four statutory factors set forth in AIA section 18 ( b ) ( 1 ) : _NEWLINE_ `` ( A ) whether a stay , or the denial thereof , will simplify the issues in question and streamline the trial '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that `` [ t ] his factor is essentially neutral , if not slightly against , granting a stay . '' VirtualAgility , Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 2014 WL 94371 , at *5 ( E.D.Tex . Jan. 9 , 2014 ) ( `` DCt . Op. '' ) . The court emphasized `` the thoroughness of the PTO 's prior examination of the ¡¬413 patent , during which time more *1324 than sixty prior art references were considered , '' contrasting it to `` more common business method patents '' which Congress explained `` have not been thoroughly reviewed at the PTO due to a lack of the best prior art . '' Id . at *3 . The court stated that it was not persuaded that the single prior art reference at issue in this CBM review would invalidate all or a substantial number of the asserted claims , and as a result the court would almost certainly need to consider other prior art references , including two which appellants have alleged are `` of particular importance . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court was also not persuaded that the PTAB would be likely to cancel all claims of the ¡¬413 patent under ¡± 101 , citing `` even greater uncertainty with respect to the PTAB 's ¡± 101 determination . '' Id . at *4 . The court concluded that it was `` not convinced that granting a stay will simplify the issues in this case . '' Id . at *5 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court correctly recognized that if one claim were to survive CBM review , a stay would not simplify the litigation issues in this case . There would still be full litigation of invalidity issues ; the elimination of one reference of the almost fifty references that the defendants placed at issue in the district court would not simplify this case . In addition , the defendants in the district court litigation raised invalidity defenses under sections 103 , 112 , and 256 , whereas the CBM proceeding involves only sections 101 and 102 . Unless each and every claim is invalidated in the CBM review , the district court was correct that a stay will simply increase the burden on the parties . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The majority states that it reached its decision on this factor without considering possible amendment to the claims . The PTO record states that VirtualAgility 's proposed amendments `` are strictly contingent on the Board finding each respective original independent claim unpatentable . '' Patent Owner 's Contingent Motion to Amend , Dkt . No . 137-1 . The district court undertook a detailed review of the proposed amendments , and concluded that in the unlikely event the amendments would affect the court 's claim construction , supplemental claim construction could be considered . The court stated : _NEWLINE_ Inconsistency would only arise under the narrow contingency that this Court sides with Defendants in construing 'processor ' and 'storage device , ' and the PTAB adopts Plaintiff 's proposed substitute claim 28 after finding that the original claim 7 is unpatentable . If this does occur , the Court will consider holding a supplemental claim construction on these two terms to resolve the conflict . In any event , the proposed amendments would not alter the construction of the remaining seven disputed claim terms . _NEWLINE_ VirtualAgility , Inc. v. Salesforce.com , Inc. , 2014 WL 807588 , at *6 n. 1 ( E.D.Tex . Feb. 27 , 2014 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In sum , the district court fully and fairly considered whether the stay would simplify the issues and streamline the trial , and concluded that it was not likely to do so . _NEWLINE_ `` ( B ) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has been set '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court discussed the stage of document production and depositions , which were proceeding toward a trial date of November 2014 , but were not yet complete . Precedent illustrates the reluctance of district courts to stay litigation that is well advanced . See Verinata Health , Inc. v. Ariosa Diagnostics , Inc. , 2014 WL 121640 , at *2 ( N.D.Cal . Jan. 13 , 2014 ) ( timing factor weighs against stay when trial date is thirteen months away and `` discovery is well underway with the parties having exchanged initial disclosures , infringement and invalidity contentions , and some document productions '' ) ; *1325 ImageVision.Net , Inc. v. Internet Payment Exch. , Inc. , 2013 WL 663535 , at *3-4 ( D.Del . Feb. 25 , 2013 ) ( timing factor weighs against stay when claim construction hearing and close of fact discovery are four and five months away respectively , even though no trial date set ) ; Universal Elecs. , Inc. , 943 F.Supp.2d at 1031 ( timing factor weighs against stay when , although little discovery had occurred , trial date was twelve months away and court had expended substantial effort construing the claims ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority states that generally the time of filing the motion to stay is the relevant time to measure the stage of litigation . Maj. op . at 1318 . The majority cites three district court cases in which the timing of filing the motion was mentioned , but in those cases there is no apparent difference in the state of discovery etc . between when the motion was filed and when it was decided . See , e.g. , Norred v. Medtronic , Inc. , No . 13-2061 , 2014 WL 554685 , at *2 ( D.Kan . Feb. 12 , 2014 ) ( granting stay when `` [ l ] ittle discovery other than initial disclosures and some preliminary document discovery has been exchanged . No depositions have been taken , no interrogatories have been served , and no expert reports have been exchanged '' ) . In Boston Scientific Corp. v. Cordis Corp. , 777 F.Supp.2d 783 , 789 ( D.Del.2011 ) , the timing of the motion was discussed only with respect to the prejudice factor . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In general , district courts consider the current stage of litigation in analyzing this factor . See , e.g. , Hansen Mfg . Corp. v. Enduro Sys. , Inc. , 2012 WL 381238 , at *1 ( D.S.D . Feb. 6 , 2012 ) ( `` The parties are currently in the discovery phase of litigation . They have provided their infringement contentions and invalidity contentions to one another . `` ) ; Forgent Networks , Inc. v. Echostar Techs . Corp. , 2006 WL 6922224 , at *2 ( E.D.Tex . Nov. 20 , 2006 ) ( `` The parties have already produced over five million pages of documents in this case and the discovery deadline is less than four months away . In addition , the parties have also fully briefed and argued the claim construction issues , and the Court is currently working on its claim construction order . `` ) ; Soverain Software LLC v. Amazon.com , Inc. , 356 F.Supp.2d 660 , 663 ( E.D.Tex.2005 ) ( `` The parties have already produced hundreds of thousands of pages of documents and millions of lines of source code and should complete discovery next month . As previously mentioned , the parties have also fully briefed and argued the claim construction issues , and the Court is currently working on its order construing the claims at issue. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority has acknowledged that the district court need not rule on a stay motion before the PTAB has actually instituted the CBM proceedings , and that the district court is not obligated to `` freeze '' the litigation proceedings while the PTAB is considering whether to proceed . Maj. op . at 1317 . It can not be correct to hold that all interim activity must be ignored , and the stay decided as if nothing had occurred.2 Such a rule contravenes the principle that when `` the Court and the parties have already expended significant resources on the litigation , the principle of maximizing the use of judicial and litigant resources is best served by seeing the case through to its conclusion . '' Mkt.-Alerts Pty . Ltd. , 922 F.Supp.2d at 494 ; see also Rensselaer Polytech . Inst . v. *1326 Apple Inc. , No . 13-cv-0633 , 2014 WL 201965 , at *5 , 8 ( N.D.N.Y . Jan. 15 , 2014 ) ( denying stay , without prejudice to renewal of request after PTO action on petition for inter partes review ) ; TPK Touch Solutions , Inc. v. Wintek Electro-Optics Corp. , No . 13-cv-2218 , 2013 WL 6021324 , at *4-5 ( N.D.Cal . Nov. 13 , 2013 ) ( denying stay pending inter partes review , observing that stay is never obligatory , but may be justified `` where the outcome of the reexamination would be likely to assist the court '' ) ; Boston Scientific , 777 F.Supp.2d at 789 ( denying stay , explaining that the stage of litigation clearly cuts against a stay because discovery was complete , and stating that the reexamination is `` fraught with the potential for multiple appeals '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` ( C ) whether a stay , or the denial thereof , would unduly prejudice the nonmoving party or present a clear tactical advantage for the moving party '' _NEWLINE_ The district court held that the prejudice factor `` weighs heavily against granting a stay . '' DCt . op . at *7 . The district court explained that courts are reluctant to stay proceedings where the parties are direct competitors , and observed that the `` loss of market share and consumer goodwill is particularly high in the growing market of enterprise cloud-computing , where contractors and governmental agencies are developing lists of preferred vendors . '' Id . at *6 ( citing Polymer Techs. , Inc. v. Bridwell , 103 F.3d 970 , 975-76 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` Years after infringement has begun , it may be impossible to restore a patentee 's ... exclusive position by an award of damages and a permanent injunction . Customers may have established relationships with infringers. '' ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that Salesforce and VirtualAgility compete in the same market and the same customer base , and stated that VirtualAgility , a small company with limited resources , `` will be 'forced to compete against products that incorporate and infringe ' its own invention . '' DCt . op . at *6 ( quoting Douglas Dynamics , LLC v. Buyers Prods . Co. , 717 F.3d 1336 , 1344 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ) . The court concluded that granting a stay would unduly prejudice VirtualAgility both in the marketplace and in this litigation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that Salesforce and VirtualAgility `` directly compete in at least the enterprise cloud computing market targeting public sector entities . '' DCt . op . at *6 . The panel majority states that there was no evidence of direct competition . That is contrary to the record . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ VirtualAgility 's President and Chief Executive Officer stated that he has `` personally had conversations with VirtualAgility customers and potential customers in which the customer or potential customer compares the functionality of VirtualAgility 's products with that of Salesforce 's products . '' Declaration of Stuart E. Rudolph ( June 19 , 2013 ) at J.A . 317 . He stated that those customers include federal and state agencies , which he identified . Id . The district court did not clearly err in finding that the parties directly compete in the enterprise cloud computing market targeting public sector entities . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The panel majority acknowledges the district court 's undue prejudice findings , but gives them scant weight . Instead , my colleagues fault VirtualAgility for not moving for a preliminary injunction . Maj. op . at 1320 . The district court presented a perceptive analysis of this position : _NEWLINE_ A party 's decision to seek or not seek a preliminary injunction often rests upon a variety of factors , including that party 's resources , the uncertainty of the outcome , or as part of an overall strategy to streamline the process and focus on other procedural steps in the litigation . Not being in a role to judge the parties ' litigation strategy , the Court deems it unfair to hold VirtualAgility to *1327 a position based upon what is no more than a dubious implication . _NEWLINE_ DCt . op . at *7 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A preliminary injunction proceeding often delays the litigation , and it is a truism that interim relief is not easy to obtain . The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold VirtualAgility 's reasonable choice against it . See Zillow , Inc. v. Trulia , Inc. , 2013 WL 5530573 , at *6-7 ( W.D.Wash . Oct. 7 , 2013 ) ( collecting cases on the significance of failure to seek a preliminary injunction ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court here gave weight to VirtualAgility 's small size and limited resources , the competitive relationship between the parties , and the high potential for loss of market share and consumer goodwill in the market in which they compete . The court concluded that a stay may cause `` outsized consequences '' to VirtualAgility . DCt . op . at *5 . The district court reasonably weighed the undue prejudice factor heavily against granting a stay . _NEWLINE_ `` ( D ) whether a stay , or the denial thereof , will reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and on the court '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With the stay now imposed by my colleagues , VirtualAgility will undergo an inter partes trial in the PTAB on some , but not all , of the invalidity issues that the defendants raised in the district court . Whichever side loses in the PTO then has the right first to request reconsideration by the PTAB , and then the right of judicial review of the PTO decision . Unless all of VirtualAgility 's patent claims are finally eliminated in the PTO and that ruling sustained on appeal , the procedure could be repeated in the district court . The district court has discretion to consider this tactical reality , in exercising its discretion to weigh the burden of litigation on the parties and the court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is apparent that the district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing and balancing the statutory factors and declining to stay its proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Conclusion _NEWLINE_ The panel majority has imposed greater rigor on `` stay '' considerations than the statute warrants . Post-grant review in the PTO is a useful tool , but the principle of post-grant review does not require elimination of judicial discretion to proceed with pending litigation . Indeed , the America Invents Act contemplates such discretion . I must , respectfully , dissent from my colleagues ' distortion of the statutory plan . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 759 F.3d 1307 , 111 U.S.P.Q.2d 1763 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ When we refer to `` Defendants , '' we mean all defendants-appellants . When we refer to `` Salesforce , '' however , we mean only `` Salesforce.com , Inc. '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the petitioner in the CBM proceeding , Salesforce is estopped from asserting at the district court that the ¡¬413 patent claims are `` invalid on any ground that [ it ] raised during the ... proceeding . '' AIA ¡± 18 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( D ) . Although this provision does not apply to the other , non-petitioner defendants in this case , `` all other defendants will agree to this same scope of statutory estoppel '' if a stay pending CBM review is granted . Defendants ' Joint Motion To Stay Proceedings at 8 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It would also be inappropriate for the district court to evaluate the potential success of an APA challenge to the PTAB 's determination that the ¡¬413 patent is a `` covered business method patent '' when analyzing whether CBM review will simplify the issues and reduce the burdens on the parties and the court . Like the district court 's validity analysis , this inquiry would amount to an improper collateral attack on the PTAB 's decision to institute CBM review . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We note that , while the same pieces of evidence can often relate to both the first and the fourth factors as they do here , this may not always be the case . While simplifying issues would as a general matter always reduce the burdens of litigation on the parties and the court , the reduced burden of litigation factor may implicate other considerations , such as the number of plaintiffs and defendants , the parties ' and witnesses ' places of residence , issues of convenience , the court 's docket , and in particular its potential familiarity with the patents at issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dissent is correct that some cases discuss the time of the motion in conjunction with the prejudice factor because those cases were considering whether defendants ' delays in seeking a stay would unduly prejudice the plaintiff-an entirely different issue . None of those cases suggests , however , that the stage of the litigation should be anything other than the time of the filing of the motion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While district courts should generally consider `` whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date has been set '' as of the date of the stay motion , there was no error in also taking into account the stage of litigation as of the date that CBM review was granted . Similarly , the district court may consider evidence that develops after the date of the stay motion-for example , the fact that the PTAB granted the CBM petition , any claim amendments proposed or entered in the post-grant proceeding , further evidence of competition , and so on-as it pertains to the other three factors . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 7 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This period may be extended by no more than six months `` for good cause shown . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 326 ( a ) ( 11 ) ( 2012 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 8 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We note , however , that it may not be necessary , or even prudent , in some situations for the petitioner to provide all known prior art , no matter how irrelevant or redundant , to the PTAB during CBM review . Failure to advance irrelevant or redundant prior art would not demonstrate a clear tactical advantage . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Compare 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1659 ( a ) , giving a party in district court the absolute right to a stay when there is a concurrent action in the International Trade Commission , provided only that the stay request is made 30 days after the party is named as a respondent , or 30 days after the district court action is filed , whichever is later . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In some jurisdictions , the district court case may have received major effort in the interim . It is reported that for patent litigation cases filed in the fast track Eastern District of Virginia between 2000 and 2010 the average trial was completed less than a year after the case was filed . Mark Lemley , Where to File Your Patent Case , 38 AIPLA Q.J . No . 4 , at 1 ( Fall 2010 ) .

( `` DeAngelo '' ) appeals from the denial by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida of DeAngelo 's motion for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) as to invalidity and infringement of U.S . Patents No . 5,740,670 ( `` ¡¬670 Patent '' ) and No . 6,035,633 ( `` ¡¬633 Patent '' ) owned by Woodrow Woods ( `` Woods '' ) and exclusively licensed to Marine Exhaust Systems , Inc. ( `` MES '' ) following a jury verdict in MES 's favor . DeAngelo also appeals the district court 's evidentiary ruling and claim construction underlying the jury verdict and the denial of DeAngelo 's motion to sanction MES for failing to conduct an adequate pre-filing investigation . For the reasons set forth below , this court affirms . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . The Patents in Suit _NEWLINE_ Water jacketed marine exhaust systems cool exhaust as it exits the engine of a marine vessel . These devices generally consist of two metal cylinders with exhaust flowing through the inner cylinder and water flowing through the space between the inner and outer cylinders . The patents in suit are directed to an apparatus that more efficiently cools exhaust by tapering the tail end of the outer liner so it directs the cooling water into the exhaust stream , and prevents water migration and corrosion by tapering the tail end of the inner liner to reduce the turbulence at the end of the pipe . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Woods filed U.S. Patent Application No . 08/419,097 ( `` ¡¬097 Application '' ) on April 10 , 1995 . The ¡¬097 Application disclosed and claimed : ( 1 ) a water jacketed exhaust system with an elongated , tapered , inner liner and outer shell ; ( 2 ) a spacer separating the liner and shell ; and ( 3 ) the inner and outer tapered surfaces acting as a clip for turbulence and a deflection surface respectively . *1276 See , e.g. , ¡¬097 Application claim 1 . On December 29 , 1995 , Woods filed U.S. Patent Application No . 08/580,548 ( `` ¡¬548 Application '' ) as a continuation-in-part ( `` CIP '' ) of the ¡¬097 Application . The ¡¬ 548 Application 's claims were broader than the ¡¬097 Application 's claims . For example , claim 1 of the ¡¬548 Application required extension of the inner liner beyond the outer shell , but did not limit the tapered surfaces to deflecting water and clipping turbulence . Compare ¡¬097 Application claim 1 , with ¡¬548 Application claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On July 1 , 1996 , an examiner rejected all claims of the ¡¬097 Application as anticipated by U.S . Patents No . 5,212,949 ( `` Shiozawa '' ) and No . 799,013 ( `` Moffitt '' ) . Instead of responding to the ¡¬097 anticipation rejection , Woods allowed the ¡¬097 Application to go abandoned and continued to prosecute the CIP ¡¬548 Application . On April 25 , 1997 , the same examiner who had rejected the ¡¬097 Application allowed several of the claims in the ¡¬548 Application . On April 21 , 1998 , the ¡¬548 Application issued as the ¡¬670 Patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On December 15 , 1997 , before the ¡¬548 Application had matured into the ¡¬670 Patent , Woods filed CIP application No . 08/990,821 ( `` ¡¬821 Application '' ) . The invention claimed in the ¡¬821 Application was similar to that of the ¡¬548 Application , but was not limited to an elongated inner liner extending beyond the outer shell . On April 1 , 1999 , the examiner rejected claims 1-4 , 6 , and 8-21 of the ¡¬821 Application as anticipated by U.S. Patent No . 4,977,741 ( `` Lulloff '' ) . Woods amended the claims by reciting a spacer between the inner and outer cylinders that created a back pressure so that water forcefully sprayed out of a spray ring . Woods argued that Lulloff did not contain this limitation and that the amended claims were not anticipated . Woods never argued that the claims were or were not patentable as initially written . The examiner allowed the amended claims , and the ¡¬821 Application issued as the ¡¬ 633 Patent on March 14 , 2000 . Woods exclusively licensed both the ¡¬670 and ¡¬633 Patents to MES . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B. Pre-Suit Investigation _NEWLINE_ MES competes with DeAngelo in the marine exhaust system market . Sometime prior to March 2006 , other members of the industry informed MES that DeAngelo was selling exhaust systems that were believed to infringe the Woods patents . Based on these statements , on March 10 , 2006 , MES wrote a letter to DeAngelo requesting information on its water cooled products . DeAngelo indicated in an April 3 , 2006 response that it would investigate MES 's infringement concerns and contact MES . DeAngelo never contacted MES after sending its initial April 3 , 2006 letter . Over a year later one of MES 's employees photographed an allegedly infringing DeAngelo device on a vessel in West Palm Beach , FL . A year after that , Sheila Prieschl , Vice President of MES , personally inspected and photographed additional DeAngelo devices . On December 31 , 2008 , after reviewing these photographs , MES and Woods filed this patent infringement suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. The Proceedings Below _NEWLINE_ Woods 's suit alleged that DeAngelo infringed one or more claims of the ¡¬670 or ¡¬633 Patents and sought both damages and injunctive relief . DeAngelo responded that it did not infringe the Woods patents and that the asserted claims are invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . The case moved forward with discovery set to close on February 9 , 2010 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ From the record it appears that on May 15 , 2009 , MES propounded Interrogatory 25 , which read : `` State with specificity all prior art that anticipates such claims of *1277 one or more of the patents at issue or renders them obvious . In doing so , specify the particular claim being referred to and identify why such prior art anticipates such claims or renders them obvious . '' Pl 's Mot . to Strike and/or Exclude Evidence of Prior Art not Disclosed in Disc , Ex . A , Woods v. DeAngelo Marine Exhaust , Inc. , No . 08-cv-81579 ( S.D.Fla . Apr . 11 , 2010 ) , ECF No . 177-1 ( `` Mot . to Strike Drawings '' ) . It appears that DeAngelo timely responded in mid-June that `` [ the ] interrogatory seeks attorney work-product information , and is not discoverable . DeAngelo has not yet decided which prior art references it will use to challenge the validity of the patents in suit ... [ they ] shall be disclosed as required by 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On February 8 , 2010 , the day before discovery closed , DeAngelo located several engineering drawings that allegedly predated the ¡¬670 and ¡¬633 Patents . DeAngelo immediately forwarded the drawings to MES with a letter stating that `` [ t ] hese documents arguably may anticipate the Woods invention ( s ) , or may be relied upon as showing the state of the art in the early 1990 's . '' E-mail from Michael C. Cesarano , counsel for DeAngelo , to Jennifer Simpson , counsel for MES ( Feb. 8 , 2010 ) ( J.A . 293 ) ( `` Disclosure E-mail '' ) . DeAngelo 's letter questioned `` whether [ MES ] would object to [ DeAngelo 's ] use of [ the newly discovered drawings ] if trial should begin before March 10 , '' because DeAngelo 's disclosure would then violate 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 . Id . It appears that MES did not object at that time . Oral Arg . at 17:10-18:25 , available at http : // www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/all/woods.html . On February 12 , 2010 , the parties submitted their joint pretrial stipulation and included their exhibit and witness lists . DeAngelo 's exhibit list included Exhibit 38 : `` Prior art drawings of DeAngelo Marine Exhaust risers and diffusers . '' Def . 's Ex . and Witness List , Woods v. DeAngelo Marine Exhaust , Inc. , No . 08-cv-81579 ( S.D.Fla . Feb. 12 , 2010 ) , ECF No . 105-2 . These were the drawings found on February 8 , 2010 . On February 24 , 2010 , DeAngelo alleged that MES and Woods failed to conduct an adequate pre-filing investigation and moved for sanctions under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A two-week jury trial commenced on April 5 , 2010 . At the beginning of DeAngelo 's defense , MES moved under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26 and 37 to strike the drawings DeAngelo had found on February 8 , 2010 . See Mot . to Strike Drawings . MES argued that because DeAngelo had failed to adequately supplement Interrogatory 25 with information about these drawings , they were not properly identified prior to the close of discovery and should be excluded . The district court found a violation of Rule 26 ( e ) , ruling that : _NEWLINE_ a party confronted with interrogatory [ sic ] of that nature has some obligation to move forward with the development of its defense and in a timely fashion to respond and supplement to its answer ... . [ T ] o wait to do that until February 8th of 2010 is not responsible ... . [ T ] his is not a timely response and it is not a timely supplement to the propounded interrogatory . It is not a timely supplement to the answer that was [ originally ] given ... its timing is way off , it should have done that much earlier . _NEWLINE_ Tr . of Prior Art Argument at 23-25 , Woods v. DeAngelo Marine Exhaust , Inc. , No . 08-cv-81579 ( S.D.Fla . Sept. 12 , 2010 ) , ECF No . 284 ( `` Prior Art Argument '' ) ( emphasis added ) ( paragraph structure not indicated ) . The court then found DeAngelo 's untimely disclosure neither justified nor harmless and excluded the drawings pursuant to *1278 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 ( c ) ( 1 ) . The jury found Woods 's patents valid and infringed and DeAngelo renewed its motions for JMOL on validity and infringement . On June 3 , 2010 , the court denied DeAngelo 's motions for JMOL and for sanctions against Woods and MES . DeAngelo timely appealed and alleges five errors by the district court : ( 1 ) the exclusion of its drawings ; ( 2 ) the district court 's claim construction ; ( 3 ) denial of JMOL as to validity ; ( 4 ) denial of JMOL as to non-infringement ; and ( 5 ) denial of its motion to impose Rule 11 sanctions .

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 and 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo 's principal argument is that the district court erred by excluding the engineering drawings disclosed on February 8 , 2010 , as an untimely interrogatory supplement despite DeAngelo 's identification of the drawings immediately upon finding them and on the final day of the scheduled discovery period . DeAngelo points out that it stated in its initial interrogatory response that it had not decided which prior art references it would use and would disclose the references on which it would rely as required by 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 . It is undisputed that these drawings were *1279 disclosed more than thirty days before trial as specified by ¡± 282 . DeAngelo also argues that the court failed to address its contention that MES waived its right to object to the drawings by not objecting when it received them . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ MES counters that the court properly excluded the drawings because DeAngelo failed to supplement its answer to MES 's Interrogatory 25 , failed to justify its late disclosure , and failed to show that the late disclosure was harmless . Oral Arg . at 20:50-21:20 , available at http : //www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/2010-1478/all/woods.html . Accordingly , this appeal requires us to determine whether the district court abused its discretion by excluding the drawings , despite DeAngelo 's discovery and disclosure of the drawings within the thirty-day period required by ¡± 282 , and within the discovery period set by the court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . _NEWLINE_ We begin by disposing of DeAngelo 's argument that MES waived its right to object to the drawings . DeAngelo cites several cases to support its contention that MES waived its right to object by not doing so when it received DeAngelo 's letter disclosing the drawings and supplementing its interrogatory answer . See Butler v. Pettigrew , 409 F.2d 1205 , 1207 ( 7th Cir.1969 ) ( finding waiver when plaintiffs did not object until after entry of judgment ) ; Sure Fill & Seal , Inc. v. GFF , Inc. , 2010 WL 3063287 , at *7 n. 4 ( M.D.Fla . July 6 , 2010 ) ( citing Brandt v. Vulcan , Inc. , 30 F.3d 752 , 756-57 ( 7th Cir.1994 ) ) . Those cases merely support the proposition that a trial court 's decision whether or not to find waiver is discretionary-they do not compel this court to find that a district court abuses its discretion when it does not find waiver in a case like this . Here , the district court was given no clear basis on which to find waiver , and we see no reason to question the district court 's actions or re-visit the issue . Accordingly , we turn to the merits of DeAngelo 's argument . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . _NEWLINE_ This court generally reviews application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by applying the law of the regional circuit . Trilogy Commc'ns. , Inc. v. Times Fiber Commc'ns. , Inc. , 109 F.3d 739 , 744 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that courts have broad discretion to fashion discovery sanctions . United States v. Certain Real Prop . Located at Route 1 , Bryant Ala. , 126 F.3d 1314 , 1317 ( 11th Cir.1997 ) . Issues that are `` unique to patent law , '' however , are reviewed as a matter of Federal Circuit law . O2 Micro , 467 F.3d at 1364 . The application of ¡± 282 is `` unique to patent law . '' Thus , Federal Circuit law governs its application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Rule 26 imposes an obligation on parties to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the factual basis of their discovery responses and requires that a party who `` responded to an interrogatory ... supplement or correct its disclosure or response ... in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect ... . '' Fed.R.Civ.P . 26 ( e ) ( 1 ) ; see also id . 26 ( b ) . Indeed , the district court has discretion , when circumstances warrant , to exclude evidence not produced in compliance with a proper discovery request . See Goodman-Gable-Gould , 595 F.3d at 1210-13 ( affirming the district court 's exclusion of evidence because statements made during a deposition and references to relevant expenses in a discovery supplement did not provide notice of the party 's theory of liability ; those disclosures did not constitute a supplement at all ) ; see also Innogenetics , N.V. v. Abbott Labs. , 512 F.3d 1363 , 1375-76 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( affirming the district court 's exclusion of a prior art *1280 patent disclosed on the final day of discovery because `` the time for depositions had passed [ and ] Abbott had not discussed the Cha patent in an expert report , identified it during discovery in response to Innogenetics ' interrogatories on anticipation , or mentioned it in the final pretrial conference '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Contention interrogatories-like the interrogatory here-serve an important purpose in helping to discover facts supporting the theories of the parties . Answers to contention interrogatories also serve to narrow and sharpen the issues thereby confining discovery and simplifying trial preparation . See Fed.R.Civ.P . 33 advisory committee 's note ( 1970 Amendment , Subdivision ( b ) ) . This court has recognized that answers to contention interrogatories evolve over time as theories of liability and defense begin to take shape ; answers to those interrogatories may not come into focus until the end of discovery . See O2 Micro , 467 F.3d at 1365 . Rule 26 ( e ) requires that as theories mature and as the relevance of various items of evidence changes , responses to interrogatories , and particularly contention interrogatories , be corrected or supplemented to reflect those changes . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court has considerable discretion in overseeing compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , including discretion to permit parties to defer supplementing responses to contention interrogatories until theories of the case have ripened for trial . Given that deferred responses to contention interrogatories may result in considerable last minute activity in preparation for trial , however , some courts have passed local rules limiting the extent to which parties are at liberty to defer answering contention interrogatories . See id . at 1365-66 . Independent of the existence , vel non , of such local rules , district courts have discretion to exclude evidence when a party acts in bad faith or prejudices its adversary by deliberately delaying , or wholly failing , to respond to contention interrogatories . See Zenith Elecs . Corp. v. WH-TV Broad. , Corp. , 395 F.3d 416 , 420 ( 7th Cir.2005 ) ( `` The district judge banned evidence on that subject after WH-TV failed to respond to Zenith 's contentions interrogatory with a description of its damages theory and the proof to be employed ... . His decision was not an abuse of discretion. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Recognizing the evolving nature of the contentions of the parties leading up to trial and to protect patentees from unfair and prejudicial surprise at trial , Congress established 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 to provide a statutory outer limit for the disclosure of certain information relating specifically to defenses to be relied upon by an accused infringer at trial . Section 282 requires notice in writing : _NEWLINE_ at least thirty days before the trial , of ... any publication to be relied upon ... as showing the state of the art , and the name and address of any person who may be relied upon as the prior inventor or as having prior knowledge of or as having previously used or offered for sale the invention of the patent in suit . In the absence of such notice proof of the said matters may not be made at the trial except on such terms as the court requires . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Section 282 does not eliminate a defendant 's obligations under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . To the contrary , the statute and the rules are intended to coexist . See ATD Corp. v. Lydall , Inc. , 159 F.3d 534 , 551 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( `` The purpose of ¡± 282 , like that of the Federal Rules , is to prevent unfair and prejudicial surprise , not to facilitate last-minute production of evidence . `` ) ; see also Thermo King Corp. v. White 's Trucking Serv. , Inc. , 292 F.2d 668 , 674 ( 5th Cir.1961 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1281 3 . _NEWLINE_ During the hearing on MES 's motion to exclude the drawings , the district court treated the timing of the production of the drawings and the supplementation of the interrogatory as two separate , but related issues . See Prior Art Argument at 3-8 . When gathering the facts necessary to its decision , the district court inquired : `` Why were [ the drawings ] not produced in an earlier fashion and why was the answer to the interrogatory not supplemented at an earlier time . '' Id . at 8 ( emphasis added ) . After receiving DeAngelo 's response describing why the documents were not produced earlier , the district court again asked `` why was n't the answer to the interrogatory supplemented ? '' Id . at 12 . In issuing its decision , the district court specifically considered DeAngelo 's contention that the e-mail of February 8 , 2010 was a supplement to Interrogatory 25 . Id . at 24 . The court quoted the e-mail , which was admittedly `` general , '' and concluded that the e-mail was `` not a timely supplement to the propounded interrogatory . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While the ruling by the district court did not explicitly address the propriety of the supplementation and focused primarily on the issue of timeliness , the record is clear that both issues were presented to the district court and are reiterated before us on appeal . MES specifically argues that `` [ w ] hile DeAngelo provided the documents to MES 's attorney on February 8 , 2010 , DeAngelo did not clearly state the purpose of the documents or how they might be used . '' Appellee 's Br . 20 . MES thus argues that the February 8 e-mail `` did not serve to supplement the mandatory Rule 26 disclosures or the interrogatory responses . '' Id . at 22 ( emphasis added ) . Woods also specifically raised the issue at oral argument , stating `` there was no Rule 26 ( e ) disclosure-the providing of the documents without answering the questions that we actually asked and without giving us the information that we actually needed is not a satisfactory Rule 26 ( e ) disclosure . '' See Oral Arg . at 20:48-21:04 . Thus , the `` issue '' here-whether DeAngelo 's e-mail of February 8 constituted an adequate and timely supplement to its interrogatory response-includes consideration of both the timeliness of the response and the propriety of the supplementation of the interrogatory itself . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 . _NEWLINE_ The district court held that the documents in question were not timely produced and imposed a sanction under Rule 37 ( c ) for their late production . To be sure , ¡± 282 , in requiring that a party `` give notice ... in writing to the adverse party at least thirty days before the trial , ... of any publication to be relied upon as anticipation of the patent in suit or ... as showing the state of the art , '' imposes only a minimum limit on the duty to disclose prior art references . The district court , by local rule1 or by court order,2 may require such production at an earlier date . But the problem here is that there was no such local rule or court order , save the order setting a discovery deadline of February 9 , 2010 . The documents were disclosed on February 8 , before the discovery deadline and before the thirty day outer *1282 limit set by ¡± 282 . Furthermore , Rule 26 ( e ) requires only that parties supplement prior discovery responses `` in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect ... . '' Fed.R.Civ.P . 26 ( e ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( emphasis added ) . The rule prohibits parties who are aware of their deficient response from `` hold [ ing ] back material items and disclos [ ing ] them at the last moment . '' 8A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller , Federal Practice and Procedure ¡± 2049.1 ( 3d ed.2011 ) ; see also Fed.R.Civ.P . 26 advisory committee 's note ( 1993 Amendment , Subdivision ( e ) ) ( `` The obligation to supplement disclosures and discovery responses applies whenever a party learns that its prior disclosures or responses are in some material respect incomplete or incorrect. '' ) . DeAngelo disclosed the drawings within one day of their discovery and thus did not shirk its obligations under Rule 26 ( e ) with respect to timely production of the drawings . Whether DeAngelo made a reasonable inquiry in the first instance , however , as to the whereabouts of such drawings is unclear . But we need not answer that question as the issue before us can be resolved on the basis of the inadequacy of the supplementation itself . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court agrees with the district court that Rule 26 ( e ) was violated and concludes that the district court imposed an appropriate sanction . The interrogatory in question did more than require the identification of documents ( a requirement that DeAngelo satisfied by the production ) . It requested that DeAngelo `` [ s ] tate with specificity all prior art that anticipates such claims of one or more of the patents at issue or renders them obvious . In doing so , specify the particular claim being referred to and identify why such prior art anticipates such claims or renders them obvious . '' Mot . to Strike Drawings at 1-2 ( emphasis added ) . While DeAngelo 's e-mail of February 8 , 2010 ( in which it disclosed the drawings ) stated that the drawings `` may anticipate the Woods inventions , or may be relied upon as showing the state of the art in the early 1990 's , '' DeAngelo did not comply with the emphasized requirements before the discovery deadline . Such compliance was important . As discussed above , contention interrogatories serve an important purpose in enabling a party to discover facts related to its opponent 's contentions . In order for MES to have an opportunity to meaningfully challenge DeAngelo 's reliance on the drawings as prior art ( including whether the drawings were published or whether devices made from the drawings contained the claimed features and were in fact on sale in the early 1990s ) , it would have needed to know what features of the drawings DeAngelo contended rendered MES 's patents obvious on a claim-by-claim basis.3 See Innogenetics , 512 F.3d at 1376 ( `` Abbott 's disclosure of the Cha patent as an anticipatory prior art reference on the very last day of discovery meant Innogenetics was stripped of any meaningful opportunity to prepare an adequate cross-examination of the reference. '' ) . Having failed to provide MES with this information , DeAngelo 's purported supplement of its response to Interrogatory 25 was in violation of Rule 26 ( e ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Having properly found that DeAngelo 's failure to supplement its interrogatory response was a violation of Rule 26 ( e ) , the district court was well within its discretion in excluding the drawings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 ( c ) . The court found that DeAngelo 's failure to *1283 supplement its interrogatory response harmed MES because the drawings themselves were not prior art , and MES would need to depose people and subpoena records to defend against testimony that these drawings would elicit . Prior Art Argument at 25-30 . The court found that MES could not cure this harm at such a late stage . Id . This court sees no error in the district court 's explicit findings that DeAngelo 's failure to supplement its interrogatory response prejudiced MES and hindered MES 's ability to put on its case and that this error was not substantially justified or harmless . See Fed.R.Civ.P . 37 ( c ) ( `` If a party fails to [ supplement an interrogatory response ] as required by Rule [ 26 ( e ) ] , the party is not allowed to use that information ... to supply evidence on a motion , at a hearing , or at a trial , unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless . `` ) ; see also Eaton Corp. v. Appliance Valves Corp. , 790 F.2d 874 , 879 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) ( `` The boundaries of the district court 's discretion are defined by unfair , prejudicial harm to a party deprived of an adequate opportunity to present its case. '' ) . Thus we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in precluding DeAngelo from relying on the drawings as prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. Claim Construction _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo next argues that the district court erred in its construction of four disputed claim terms . According to DeAngelo , the court 's constructions fail to account for the inventions ' physical and functional limitations required by the specifications . See ICU Med. , Inc. v. Alaris Med . Sys. , Inc. , 558 F.3d 1368 , 1375-76 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . MES counters that DeAngelo merely proposes alternative , more restrictive descriptions of terms that already have a clear meaning to one of skill in the art , and the district court 's construction correctly refrains from reading unnecessary limitations into the claims . See Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1323 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( en banc ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim terms are given their ordinary and customary meaning-the meaning that they would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in light of the specification and prosecution history at the time of the invention . Id . at 1312-13 . The specification need not describe every embodiment of the claimed invention , see Netword , LLC v. Centraal Corp. , 242 F.3d 1347 , 1352 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) , and the claims should not be confined to the disclosed embodiments-even when the specification discloses only one embodiment , Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1323 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim terms are properly construed to include limitations not otherwise inherent in the term only `` when a patentee sets out a definition and acts as his own lexicographer , '' or `` when the patentee disavows the full scope of a claim term either in the specification or during prosecution . '' Thorner v. Sony Computer Entm't . Am. , LLC , 669 F.3d 1362 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) . `` To act as its own lexicographer , a patentee must 'clearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim term ' ... . '' Id . ( quoting CCS Fitness , Inc. v. Brunswick Corp. , 288 F.3d 1359 , 1366 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) ) . Moreover , `` [ w ] here the specification makes clear that the invention does not include a particular feature , that feature is deemed to be outside ... the patent , even though the language of the claims , read without reference to the specification , might be considered broad enough to encompass the feature in question . '' Id . at 1366 ( internal citation omitted ) . As detailed below , the district court 's construction of each term is consistent with the plain meaning of the term , while DeAngelo 's constructions require us to adopt limitations not defined in , or required by , the specification . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1284 1 . `` elongated outer shell '' _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo argues that the court 's construction of the claimed expression `` elongated outer shell '' as `` the outer pipe that extends past the spray ring , '' is overly broad and should be limited to outer shells having a length sufficient to deflect and break apart water from the spray ring-the function stated in the specification . MES counters that the plain meaning of `` elongated '' outer shell is simply that the outer shell extends past the spray ring . MES points to claims that cover an embodiment where the water is not directed toward the outer shell . See ¡¬633 Patent col. 7 ll . 45-62 ; ¡¬670 Patent col. 6 ll . 17-33 . MES thus contends that defining the term `` elongated outer shell '' as a shell long enough to deflect water improperly reads a limitation into the term-a limitation not required by every embodiment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ MES is correct . Nothing in the plain meaning of `` elongated outer shell '' requires that the shell extend far enough past the inner shell to serve as a deflection plane for water . In fact , `` elongated '' is an adjective used to describe both the inner liner and outer shell within the same claim . Compare ¡¬ 633 Patent col. 7 l. 48 ( `` an elongated inner liner '' ) , with ¡¬ 633 Patent col. 7 l. 50 ( `` an elongated outer shell '' ) . Therefore `` elongated '' can not mean long enough to provide a deflection surface ; and `` outer shell '' simply refers to the outer cylinder . Woods 's abandonment of the ¡¬097 Application , an event that DeAngelo stresses in its obviousness argument , further undermines DeAngelo 's claim construction argument . The claims of the abandoned ¡¬097 Application expressly required a deflection surface for the sprayed water . The ¡¬670 Patent 's claims do not have such a limitation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The patentee did not expressly define `` elongated outer shell '' as providing a deflection surface , nor did he disavow an outer liner that does not deflect water . This court will not read such a limitation into the term merely because it is disclosed in some embodiments . Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1323 . The district court correctly construed `` elongated outer shell . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . `` inwardly tapered section '' _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo next argues that the court erred in construing the phrase `` inwardly tapered section '' as `` the section of the elongated outer shell or elongated inner liner that has a reduction in diameter . '' Just as DeAngelo urged us to limit `` elongated outer shell '' to account for the `` functional limitation '' of a water deflection surface , it argues that `` inwardly tapered section '' should also be so limited . According to DeAngelo , the term should be construed to require the tapered section occur near the tail end of the shell , so water can deflect off of the tapered surface . In support , DeAngelo points to embodiments in the specification where water collides with the inwardly tapered section . See , e.g. , ¡¬670 Patent col. 2 U . 25-28 . MES disagrees and argues that while some embodiments may indeed function by deflecting water off of the tapered surface into the exhaust stream , the claims need not be restricted to that embodiment . We see nothing in the claims or written description to warrant limiting this term to a single embodiment . The district court correctly construed `` inwardly tapered section '' not to require a deflection surface . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 . `` directed towards '' _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo argues that the district court 's construction of the phrase `` directed towards '' as `` caused to flow in a direction that results in contact with , '' is overly broad because the specification requires the water to hit the liner with enough force to fan out , not merely contact the liner . MES counters that the ordinary meaning of the phrase `` directed towards '' *1285 is clear and unencumbered with the additional limitation DeAngelo seeks to incorporate . According to MES , nothing warrants adding the requirement of a forceful collision to the term `` directed towards . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court 's construction of `` directed towards '' is correct . Like the other disputed terms , the specification does not require the water to forcefully collide with a surface . For example , some claims specifically require that the water forcefully exit the spray ring and flow towards a wall , other claims do not require such force . Compare ¡¬670 Patent col. 6 l. 64-col. 7 l. 4 , with ¡¬633 Patent col. 8 ll . 49-53 . The patentee never expressly defined `` directed towards , '' nor did he disavow the clear definition found by the district court . This court will not construe this otherwise clear term to include a limitation already present in some claims but not others . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 . `` angularly disposed '' _NEWLINE_ Finally , DeAngelo argues that the district court 's construction of `` angularly disposed '' as `` a spray ring positioned in a way that is not parallel or perpendicular to the central axis of the inner liner '' is overbroad because it does not limit the spray of the water stream towards the outer shell . DeAngelo claims that the court 's construction allows a spray ring that directs water towards the inner liner , an embodiment not described in the specification . According to DeAngelo , `` [ t ] he specifications of each of the Patents-in-Suit disclose only two possible orientations for the spray ring , '' at an approximately 90¢X angle relevant to the central axis , or directed towards the outer liner . Appellant 's Br . 55 . MES accuses DeAngelo of again reading an unwarranted limitation into the claims based on specific embodiments , in contravention of Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1323 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court 's construction comports with the ordinary meaning of this term . The phrase `` angularly disposed '' does not prescribe any specific angle . The patentee never defined the term nor disavowed a broader meaning . Furthermore , it is not necessary to read DeAngelo 's proposed limitation into the term because every claim that uses this term already limits the ring to being directed toward the outer wall . See ¡¬670 Patent col. 6 l. 54-col. 7 l. 4 , col. 7 l. 12-col. 8 l. 12 ; ¡¬633 Patent col. 8 ll . 35-53 , col. 9 ll . 11-18 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court correctly declined to read unwarranted limitations into the disputed claim terms . For the foregoing reasons , this court affirms the district court 's claim construction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D. Validity _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo challenges the district court 's denial of JMOL that the asserted claims of Woods 's patents are invalid as obvious under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . DeAngelo sets forth three main arguments in support of its obviousness contention . First , DeAngelo argues that the prior art patents contain every limitation of Woods 's asserted claims , and Woods admitted as much during prosecution when he chose to add an additional claim limitation instead of arguing to the examiner that the reference did not anticipate the claim . DeAngelo then argues that its excluded prior art drawings , see supra ¡± II.B. , render the claims obvious . Finally , DeAngelo contends that the Key Marine Riser , a product that predates Woods 's patents , exhibits a tapered inner liner , the only element of the asserted claims that is arguably not shown in the prior art patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ MES counters that the prior art references do not show every limitation of Woods 's asserted claims ; they specifically lack any teaching of a tapered inner liner . MES also argues that because DeAngelo 's prior art drawings were properly excluded , they can not support an obvious rejection . *1286 Moreover , MES argues that the jury had the opportunity to observe the Key Marine Riser and still concluded that it did not render the claims of Woods 's patents obvious . Finally , MES characterizes Woods 's patents as having solved a longstanding problem in the marine exhaust industry and that such a showing is objective evidence of non-obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Supreme Court reaffirmed the appropriate obviousness analysis in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) . The Court instructed us to : ( 1 ) determine the scope and content of the prior art , ( 2 ) ascertain the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue , ( 3 ) resolve the level of ordinary skill in the art , and ( 4 ) determine obviousness in light of objective factors like `` commercial success , long felt but unsolved needs , failure of others , etc . '' KSR , 550 U.S. at 406 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ( quoting Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City , 383 U.S. 1 , 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) ) . At bottom , the obviousness analysis is a common sense test , and `` [ i ] f a person of ordinary skill ... would have found the invention [ a ] predictable and achievable variation or combination of the prior art , then the invention likely would have been obvious . '' Rolls-Royce , PLC v. United Techs. , Corp. , 603 F.3d 1325 , 1338 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) ( citing KSR , 550 U.S. at 417 , 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . The Prior Art Patents _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo first contends that because all claims of Woods 's initial ¡¬097 Application were rejected as anticipated by the Shiozawa and Moffit references , Woods 's abandonment of the ¡¬097 Application is `` an inference , if not an admission that the claims of that application are unpatentable as being anticipated by both Shiozawa and Moffit ( thus defining the scope and content of the prior art ) . '' Appellant 's Br . 36 . MES contests that assertion and cites Paperless Accounting v. Bay Area Rapid Transit System , 804 F.2d 659 ( Fed.Cir.1986 ) , to support the proposition that Woods 's decision to abandon the ¡¬097 Application and pursue the broader ¡¬548 Application can not constitute even an inference that the ¡¬097 Application was properly rejected . MES argues that although Shiozawa and Moffit are within the prior art , neither teaches an inwardly tapered tail end of the inner liner . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo 's characterization of Woods 's abandonment of the ¡¬097 Application as an admission that the Shiozawa and Moffit references disclose every element of Woods 's patents is meritless . DeAngelo fails to consider that Woods filed the ¡¬548 Application more than six months before the examiner rejected the ¡¬097 Application . Moreover , the claims in the ¡¬548 Application are arguably broader than the claims in the ¡¬097 Application , and Woods prosecuted the ¡¬548 Application before the same examiner who eventually rejected the ¡¬097 Application . There is nothing to suggest that Woods did anything other than simply choose to pursue the similar , but broader , ¡¬548 Application instead of continuing to prosecute the ¡¬097 Application . This court declines to characterize Woods 's conduct as an admission or concession that the claims in the ¡¬097 Application are anticipated by Shiozawa or Moffitt . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo next contends that Woods 's amendment in response to the examiner 's April 1 , 1999 rejection constituted an admission that the originally filed claims of the ¡¬821 Application ( ultimately the ¡¬633 Patent ) were anticipated by Lulloff . DeAngelo argues that Woods acquiesced to the substance of the examiner 's rejection because Woods added a different limitation instead of arguing that Lulloff does not teach a tapered liner . According to DeAngelo , this qualifies as an admission that all limitations in the initial claims , *1287 including the tapered liner , existed in the prior art . DeAngelo urges us to preclude MES from now arguing that Lulloff does not contain a tapered liner . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In TorPharm , Inc. v. Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , 336 F.3d 1322 , 1330 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) , this court rejected Ranbaxy 's similar acquiescence rationale , explaining that `` Ranbaxy 's argument blurs the distinction between claims and limitations : patentability is assessed for the former , not the latter . '' Explicit limitations are material to the infringement inquiry . Id . at 1331 n. 9 . But viewing an amendment as an admission that the initial claim was unpatentable requires more than the mere presence of a limitation . See id . at 1330 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo relies on a number of reissue proceeding cases like Hester Industries , Inc. v. Stein , Inc. , 142 F.3d 1472 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) , which address the surrender of subject matter during the initial prosecution . But Hester cites Mentor Corp. v. Coloplast , Inc. , 998 F.2d 992 , 995 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) , which suggests there must be additional evidence ( e.g. , argument to the examiner ) to support a conclusion that an amendment was an admission . Hester , 142 F.3d at 1480-81 . DeAngelo also relies on Lemelson v. General Mills , Inc. , 968 F.2d 1202 , 1207-08 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) , to support its acquiescence theory . But in Lemelson , it is not clear to what extent the patentee argued the rejection with the examiner . Id . Moreover , this court specifically distinguished Lemelson in TorPharm based on similar facts to those here . TorPharm , 336 F.3d at 1331 n. 9 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court does not accept DeAngelo 's acquiescence theory as support for its contention that Lulloff contains a tapered surface as a matter of law . The examiner rejected the ¡¬821 Application as anticipated by Lulloff , which showed an elongated liner and shell with an inwardly tapered section . Woods made no statement representing that a tapered liner was not disclosed by Lulloff . He never admitted it . He never addressed it . All he argued to the examiner was that using a spacer to create back pressure in the inner volume was not disclosed by Lulloff . A patent applicant is not presumed to have conceded the presence in the prior art of every claim limitation he had no reason to dispute . This court has considered DeAngelo 's other arguments that Woods 's specifications and the prior art patents render the asserted claims of the Woods patents obvious and finds them to be without merit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . Excluded Drawings and the Key Marine Riser _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo also argues that its excluded drawings demonstrate that every limitation of the asserted claims was known in the prior art . As discussed above , see supra ¡± II.B , the district court properly excluded these drawings and the drawings are properly excluded from the obviousness analysis . Finally , DeAngelo relies on the `` Key Marine Riser , '' a device presented to the jury , to show that a tapered tail end existed in the prior art . But the jury physically inspected the Key Marine Riser and was free to conclude that it did not support DeAngelo 's theory . DeAngelo has failed to show that the prior art singly or collectively disclosed or taught every limitation of the claims at issue . On this evidence , this court can not say that the jury could not have sustained the validity of the claims at issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ E. Non-Infringement _NEWLINE_ DeAngelo 's argument that the district court erred in denying its motion for JMOL of non-infringement is relatively narrow . DeAngelo argues that MES failed to introduce any infringement evidence , other than engineering drawings , for DeAngelo 's `` notched diffusers , '' and *1288 that no reasonable jury could have found infringement based on those drawings . Although all of DeAngelo 's products contain a hose bead , DeAngelo stresses that Darrin Woods 's ( MES 's vice-president ) testimony explaining how the hose bead creates a tapered surface dealt only with `` conical diffusers . '' DeAngelo thus contends that , as a matter of law , the `` notched diffusers '' can not infringe . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ MES counters that at trial the jury heard testimony that adding a `` hose bead '' to the end of a liner , regardless of the type of diffuser , would cause an indentation and tapering effect . Also , the jury was able to physically inspect the Key Marine Riser and observe the taper that a hose bead caused . MES argues that , in light of DeAngelo 's admission that all of its products contain a hose bead , the evidence of a hose bead induced taper was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that DeAngelo 's notched diffusers also had a tapered liner and infringed the Woods patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ MES is correct . DeAngelo admitted that all of its products contain a hose bead . Darrin Woods testified that a hose bead on the diffuser causes an indentation in the liner resulting in the requisite tapered surface . Darrin Woods 's testimony was a legally sufficient basis on which the jury could have found that DeAngelo 's notched diffusers infringed the asserted claims of the Woods patents . The district court did not err by denying JMOL of non-infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ F. Rule 11 Sanctions _NEWLINE_ Finally , DeAngelo alleges that MES and Woods filed this lawsuit without conducting an adequate pre-suit investigation into whether or not DeAngelo 's products actually infringe . DeAngelo argues that MES decided to file this lawsuit based only on photographs taken by an MES employee and that MES 's attorney did not make an adequate infringement determination prior to filing . DeAngelo stresses that Woods made the decision to file the infringement suit based only on grainy photographs that Woods himself admitted did not clearly show the elements of the claims . MES counters that the grainy black and white photographs DeAngelo used to elicit Woods 's testimony were not the same photos on which the suit was based ; the suit was based on the same high definition color photos presented at trial and used to prove infringement to the jury . Moreover , Woods and MES point out that for over two years , DeAngelo denied them the access to DeAngelo 's products that they sought and that DeAngelo now argues was required . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Eleventh Circuit imposes Rule 11 sanctions where the `` frivolous nature of the claims-at-issue is unequivocal . '' Carter v. ALK Holdings , Inc. , 605 F.3d 1319 , 1323 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) . In a patent case , this court stated that `` an attorney violates Rule 11 ( b ) ( 3 ) when an objectively reasonable attorney would not believe , based on some actual evidence uncovered during the pre-filing investigation , that each claim limitation reads on the accused device ... . '' Antonious v. Spalding & Evenflo Cos. , 275 F.3d 1066 , 1074 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , the record is replete with evidence supporting the district court 's conclusion that MES conducted a sufficient pre-filing investigation including photographing and studying photographs of DeAngelo 's accused products . See supra ¡± LB . Nonetheless , DeAngelo argues that Judin v. United States , 110 F.3d 780 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) , compels the conclusion that MES 's mere observations of DeAngelo products can not constitute an adequate investigation . DeAngelo 's reliance on Judin is misplaced . In Judin , the plaintiff observed allegedly infringing products from a distance , but never sought access to investigate *1289 them more closely . Id . at 784 . Here , MES directly requested from DeAngelo , in writing , information about DeAngelo 's allegedly infringing devices . When that information was not forthcoming , MES took the photographs of DeAngelo 's products that were used as the basis for filing suit . At trial a number of witnesses testified that they could discern the features covered by the asserted claims from the digital color photographs . This is not a case like Judin where the plaintiff sued without seeking access to examine allegedly infringing devices . The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sanction MES . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , the judgment of the district court is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 692 F.3d 1272 , 83 Fed.R.Serv.3d 770 , 104 U.S.P.Q.2d 1169 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ See , e.g. , N.D.

In our earlier opinion , we held that the dosage of the prior art composition used in half-life comparisons with the patented composition was information material to patentability , but we remanded to the district court to determine whether there was an intent to deceive by Aventis in failing to disclose the dosage . After a trial on the matter , the district court found that there was intent to deceive and held the patents unenforceable for inequitable conduct . Because we find no abuse of discretion by the district court in its holding of inequitable conduct , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ Aventis is the owner of U.S. Patent No . RE 38,743 ( `` the ¡¬743 patent '' ) and U.S. Patent No . 5,389,618 ( `` the ¡¬618 patent '' ) , which was surrendered upon the issuance of the ¡¬743 Patent . The patents are directed to a composition comprising low molecular weight heparins ( `` LMWHs '' ) . Claim 1 of the ¡¬618 patent recites : _NEWLINE_ A heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides , such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight less than that of heparin and said admixture consisting essentially of _NEWLINE_ from 9 % to 20 % of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight less than 2,000 daltons _NEWLINE_ from 5 % to 20 % of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight greater than 8,000 daltons , and _NEWLINE_ from 60-86 % of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight of between 2,000 and 8,000 daltons , _NEWLINE_ the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight thereof ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 _NEWLINE_ said admixture ( i ) exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic activity greater than heparin and ( ii ) having an average molecular weight of between approximately 3,500 and 5,500 daltons . _NEWLINE_ The drug is marketed as Lovenox ( r ) in the United States and Clexane ( r ) in Europe and is effective in preventing thromboses ( blood clotting ) while minimizing the possibility of hemorrhaging , especially during high-risk surgery . According to the specification , the advantage of the claimed LMWHs as compared to heparin is that they exhibit a longer half-life , excellent bioavailability , higher rate of absorption , low clearance , resistance to degradation , increased residence time , and reduced sensitivity to serum factors . ¡¬618 patent , col. 2 , l. 55-col. 3 , l. 26 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ The prosecution history of the ¡¬618 patent is germane to the issue of inequitable conduct . Original claim 1 of the ¡¬618 patent application recited as follows : _NEWLINE_ A heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides , such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight *1338 average molecular weight less that that of heparin and which comprise from 9 % to 20 % of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight less than 2,000 daltons and from 5 % to 20 % of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight greater than 8,000 daltons , the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight thereof ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the first office action , the patent examiner rejected the claims under 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 102 ( b ) /103 over several references , including European Patent 40,144 ( `` EP ¡¬144 '' ) . The examiner stated that each of the prior art references teaches sulfated heparinic admixtures within the molecular weight ( `` MW '' ) range of the claims and is considered to be inherently the same as the claimed admixtures . In particular , the examiner explained that _NEWLINE_ the Patent and Trademark Office does not have facilities for testing and comparing various products , and where the prior art teaches a product which is identical or nearly identical to that claimed , it is incumbent upon the Applicant to convincingly demonstrate that the claimed product provides some unexpected or unobvious property not demonstrated by the prior art products . _NEWLINE_ ( Emphases added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response to the office action , Aventis independently addressed the anticipation and obviousness portion of the rejection.1 With respect to anticipation , Aventis argued that EP ¡¬144 does not expressly state that the mixture contains two types of polysaccharides , one with a MW less than 2,000 daltons and one with a MW greater than 8,000 daltons , nor does it state the number average/weight average MW ratio . Presuming , therefore , that the examiner 's anticipation rejection rested on inherency , Aventis argued that the evidence in the specification rebuts inherency . In particular , Aventis pointed to example 6 in the specification , which provides in relevant part : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This example illustrates the increase in stability , in vivo , of the mixtures of the invention , expressed by their plasma half-life . _NEWLINE_ ... . _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) From the mixtures produced in Examples 3 and 4 : _NEWLINE_ 40 mg dose : in 75 % of the cases , the half-life was longer than 4 hours , and was even longer than 4 1/2 hours in approximately 45 % of the cases ; _NEWLINE_ 60 mg dose : in 75 % of the cases , the half-life was longer than 3.7 hours . _NEWLINE_ ... . _NEWLINE_ ( 3 ) When the product was prepared according to the process described in European Patent EP 40,144 , the half-life was longer than 4 1/2 hours in 17 % of the cases . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬618 patent , col. 9 , ll . 33-58 ( emphases added ) . Example 6 was prepared with the assistance of Dr. Andre Uzan , a French chemist who was a non-inventor . Based on the example , Aventis argued that the claimed LMWHs exhibit a significantly longer half-life than formulations prepared in accordance with EP ¡¬144 . Aventis went on to explain that , because it is well established that compounds are inseparable from their properties , the evidence of a difference in a property , i.e. , half-life , serves as evidence of a difference in structure . With regard to the obviousness portion of the rejection , Aventis contended that , under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 , the prior art must suggest the modification to one of skill in the art , yet EP ¡¬144 provides absolutely no suggestion to select the particular combination of oligosaccharide chains of specified lengths as claimed . _NEWLINE_ *1339 The examiner was not convinced and issued a second ( final ) office action , maintaining the prior 102/103 rejection `` for the reasons of record in the last Office action . '' The examiner reiterated that the MW requirements of the claimed compounds are within the range of the compounds disclosed in EP ¡¬144 and that any properties would be inherent in the prior art compounds because they have the same structure as the claimed compounds.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thereafter , Aventis amended claim 1 to read : _NEWLINE_ A heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides , such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight less that that of heparin and said admixture comprising [ 3 ] _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ from 9 % to 20 % of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight less than 2,000 daltons _NEWLINE_ from 5 % to 20 % of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight greater than 8,000 daltons , and _NEWLINE_ from 60-86 % of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight of between 2,000 and 8,000 daltons , _NEWLINE_ the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight thereof ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 , _NEWLINE_ said admixture ( i ) exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic activity greater than heparin and ( ii ) having an average molecular weight of between approximately 3,500 and 5,500 daltons . _NEWLINE_ Aventis also submitted a declaration from Dr. Uzan ( `` first Uzan declaration '' ) . In ? 8 of the declaration , Dr. Uzan distinguished the claimed formulations from the formulations in EP ¡¬144 . First , he noted that the half-life of the claimed formulation is greater than 4 1/2 hours 45 % of the time , as compared to the EP ¡¬144 formulation which achieved such a half-life only 17 % of the time . He remarked , `` This represents an increase in 250 % in the half life and is very significant because it enables the same effect to be achieved with lower dosages . '' Further , Dr. Uzan stated that he analyzed the EP ¡¬144 product and found that 21 % of the chains had a MW lower than 2,000 ; 6 % of the chains had a MW greater than 8,000 ; and 73 % of the chains had a MW between 2,000 and 8,000 . Id . Finally , he concluded that `` the formulations of [ EP ¡¬144 ] are clearly outside the scope of the present invention . '' Aventis relied on example 6 and the first Uzan declaration to address the anticipation rejection , arguing that the compounds disclosed in EP ¡¬144 are not inherently the same as the claimed compounds because the claimed compounds have a longer half-life and because compounds prepared in accordance with EP ¡¬144 fall outside the scope of the claims . With respect to obviousness , Aventis argued that the claimed compounds are non-obvious over EP ¡¬144 because the compositions in EP ¡¬144 did not exhibit the unexpected properties of the claimed combination of MW chains . _NEWLINE_ In the third office action ( first office action in the continuing application ) , the examiner affirmatively withdrew several 102/103 rejections over other prior art references . The examiner continued to reject *1340 the claims under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 over EP ¡¬144 `` for the reasons of record in '' the second office action . According to the examiner , EP ¡¬144 teaches `` admixtures of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides having molecular weight ranges which are not patentably distinct from those of the instant claims . `` 4 The examiner explained that `` the instant molecular weight requirements are highly similar to those of the prior art molecular weight ranges , '' and that no evidence has been presented that the claimed compounds would have `` any properties or activities not necessarily inherent [ in ] the prior art compounds . '' With respect to the half-life comparisons between the claimed compounds and EP ¡¬144 , the examiner stated that the `` [ a ] pplicant has failed to provide evidence that the alleged difference between the half-life of the [ EP ¡¬ 144 ] product and that of the [ claimed ] mixture is statistically significant . '' Further , the examiner contended that the first Uzan declaration showed that the differences in composition based on MW were minimal and there was no showing of any unexpected results . Aventis responded by submitting another declaration from Dr. Uzan ( `` second Uzan declaration '' ) . In ? 3 of the declaration , Dr. Uzan referenced five tables comprising the raw data from the half-life comparisons between the claimed compound and the EP ¡¬144 compound , which tables were attached to the declaration.5 Dr. Uzan also provided results from a statistical analysis showing a statistically significant difference between the mean half-life for the claimed compound and that of the EP ¡¬144 compound . Specifically , Dr. Uzan reported , `` For the claimed compound T 1/2 was 4.36 ¡Ó 1.07 . For the compound of [ EP ¡¬144 ] , T 1/2 was 3.33 ¡Ó 0.2 , '' and the statistical analysis showed that 4.36 and 3.33 were statistically significant . The mean half-life of 4.36 for the claimed compound was taken from Table X , which indicated the dosage to be 40 mg . The mean half-life of 3.33 for the EP ¡¬144 compound was taken from Table III , which did not mention the dosage . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Aventis argued , in its response , that EP ¡¬144 does not suggest compounds containing polysaccharides of the claimed MW in the claimed proportions and that the examiner improperly relied on inherency to reject the claimed compounds over EP ¡¬144 . Referring to the second Uzan declaration , Aventis asserted that different half-lives are obtained with the claimed preparation as compared to the preparation of EP ¡¬144 . Therefore , Aventis averred , the claimed compounds have been shown to differ from the compounds of EP ¡¬144 in both their structure and properties . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thereafter , the ¡¬618 patent application was allowed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ Amphastar Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ( `` Amphastar '' ) and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA , Inc. ( `` Teva '' ) each filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) with the FDA to obtain approval to a market generic version of Lovenox ( r ) . The ANDA contained a paragraph IV certification challenging the two Aventis patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1341 Aventis sued both Teva and Amphastar for infringement of the ¡¬618 patent in the United States District Court for the Central District of California . Aventis Pharma S.A. v. Amphastar Pharms. , Inc. , 390 F.Supp.2d 936 , 938 ( C.D.Cal.2005 ) ( `` Aventis I '' ) . Amphastar filed a motion for summary judgment on its affirmative defense and counterclaim that the ¡¬618 patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct . Id . at 938-39 . Specifically , Amphastar averred that Dr. Uzan engaged in inequitable conduct by failing to disclose that the half-life studies comparing the patented compound to the EP ¡¬ 144 compound were at different doses . Id . at 941 , 944 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court determined that the representation by Aventis that the patented compound had an improved half-life as compared to the EP ¡¬144 compound was material to patentability because Aventis referred to the improved half-life at least four times during prosecution and the examiner ultimately allowed the ¡¬618 patent application after the final representation that the difference in mean half-life was statistically significant . Id . at 950-51 . The court found a strong inference of intent to deceive because it could find no credible explanation for comparing half-lives at different doses and because comparisons at the same dose showed little difference in half-life . Id . at 951-52 . After weighing the evidence of materiality and intent , the court found weighty uncontroverted evidence establishing inequitable conduct . Id . at 952 . It , therefore , granted summary judgment against Aventis and held the ¡¬ 618 patent unenforceable.6 Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Aventis argued that the district court erred in finding materiality because if the dose information were material to patentability , the examiner would have requested it because : she was presented with half-life data that enabled her to compare various doses , Dr. Uzan informed the examiner that the half-life comparison was done at different doses , those of skill in the art frequently compare half-lives at different doses , and half-life is independent of dose . Aventis Pharma S.A. v. Amphastar Pharms. , Inc. , 176 Fed.Appx . 117 , 120 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( `` Aventis II `` ) . To support the argument that Dr. Uzan informed the examiner that the half-life comparisons were done at different doses , Aventis relied on the statement in the first Uzan declaration that `` [ t ] his represents an increase in 250 % in the half life and is very significant because it enables the same effect to be achieved with lower dosages , '' and Dr. Uzan 's deposition testimony stating that he believed this to mean `` that the comparison is a comparison between two doses of which one is lower than the other . '' Id . at 120-21 ( emphasis added ) ( internal quotations omitted ) . Aventis relied on this same statement to argue that Dr. Uzan did not intend to deceive the examiner . Id . at 123 . Aventis further argued lack of intent based on the fact that Dr. Uzan submitted half-life data for the claimed compound at 60 mg , as well as at 40 mg. Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1342 With regard to materiality , this court held that it was not plausible to read the statement in the first Uzan declaration as indicating to the examiner that the half-life comparison was done at different doses and , therefore , there was no genuine issue of material fact that Dr. Uzan did not disclose that the comparison was made using data for the two compounds at different doses . Id . at 121 . We also rejected Aventis 's explanation for nondisclosure that using different doses in half-life comparisons was common practice in the field because , in contrast to the references cited in support of this proposition , Aventis did not disclose the actual doses . Id . Further , this court did not accept the explanation that the half-life data were dose independent because the evidence clearly suggested otherwise . Id . at 121-22 . Therefore , we concluded that the withholding of the EP ¡¬144 dosage information prevented the examiner from considering information important to patentability and constituted a failure to disclose material information . Id . at 122 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While this court found that the dosage of the EP ¡¬144 composition was indeed information material to patentability , we held that the district court erred in finding intent to deceive on summary judgment . Id . In particular , we held that the reasonableness of the comparison at different doses is relevant to determining whether there was an intent to deceive in withholding the dosage of the EP ¡¬144 composition . Id . at 122-23 . This court reasoned : _NEWLINE_ [ T ] he district court ... ultimately concluded that the facts supported a strong inference of intent to deceive . The district court 's inference was reasonable-by failing to disclose that the EP 40,144 data was at a 60 mg dose , Aventis may have been painting the rosiest picture possible as to the half-life improvement of its claimed compounds in an attempt to deceive the examiner ... . However , there is another reasonable inference-namely , as Aventis argues , if the comparison between different doses was reasonable , the failure to disclose may have been due purely to inadvertence . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 123 . Accordingly , this court reversed the grant of summary judgment of unenforceability of the ¡¬618 patent and ¡¬743 patent , and remanded to the district court for determination of whether there was intent to deceive . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following remand , the district court held a bench trial limited to the issue of intent . Aventis Pharma S.A. v. Amphastar Pharms. , Inc. , 475 F.Supp.2d 970 , 975 ( C.D.Cal.2007 ) ( `` Aventis III `` ) . Thereafter , the court issued its opinion , considering the principle explanations proffered by Aventis for Dr. Uzan 's failure to disclose the dose of the EP ¡¬144 composition in its half-life comparisons . These explanations were that : ( 1 ) comparison of half-lives at different doses was reasonable because it was customary to compare the half-lives of different drugs at the `` clinically relevant dose , '' i.e. , the dose presenting the best efficacy-safety ratio , and the half-life comparisons were intended to show a difference in therapeutic properties , not a compositional difference ; ( 2 ) comparison of half-lives at different doses was reasonable because half-lives are dose independent ; and ( 3 ) the failure to disclose was due merely to inadvertence . Id . at 977-92 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found Dr. Uzan 's clinical relevance justification implausible because such a justification presumed a compositional difference between the compounds being compared , yet the issue of inherency was repeatedly raised by the examiner during prosecution . Id . at 977-82 . The court noted that the examiner recognized that a compound 's properties , e.g. , half-life , are inherent in its composition and thereby rejected the claims as anticipated by the EP ¡¬144 compound under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 . Id . Therefore , the *1343 court was not persuaded that Dr. Uzan presented the half-life comparisons to show only a difference in property and not also a difference in composition . Id . The court was similarly unpersuaded by Aventis 's dose-independence argument because the evidence did not establish that the half-lives were dose-independent , given the high intra-subject variability . Id . at 984-86 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , the court rejected Dr. Uzan 's clinically-relevant dose justification on the grounds that it was incredible because : ( 1 ) there was no statistical difference in half-lives when the 60 mg dose of EP ¡¬144 composition was compared to the patented composition at a 20 mg , 60 mg or 80 mg dose , i.e. , there was a statistical difference only when a 40 mg dose of the patented composition was compared ; ( 2 ) the ¡¬618 patent was not limited to safe and effective doses for particular therapeutic indications ; ( 3 ) there were a number of preferred therapeutic doses for the patented composition ; and ( 4 ) Aventis offered no corroborating evidence to support Dr. Uzan 's clinically relevant dose justification . Id . at 986-89 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , the court declined to find that Dr. Uzan 's failure to disclose the difference in doses could be justified based on inadvertence because it was not credible that a scientist with Dr. Uzan 's qualifications could have committed , and failed to correct during a lengthy prosecution , such an egregious error , and there was a complete absence of evidence suggesting negligence throughout prosecution . Id . at 989-92 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Based on the totality of the facts and circumstances , the court determined that but for Dr. Uzan 's intentional omissions , the probability was high that the ¡¬618 patent would not have issued . Id . at 994 . Accordingly , the court held the ¡¬618 patent and the ¡¬743 patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Aventis appeals the district court 's finding of intent to deceive and holding of inequitable conduct . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ We review a district court 's finding of intent to deceive for clear error .

'' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ Now , on its second time on appeal , Aventis offers a new justification for Dr. Uzan 's failure to disclose the dosage information in his half-life comparisons.7 According to Aventis , Dr. Uzan 's half-life comparisons were intended to show a difference in properties in response to the obviousness rejection under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 , not to demonstrate a compositional difference to address the anticipation rejection under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 , as the district court concluded . Aventis 's argument is premised on the fact that while a half-life comparison must be done using equivalent doses to establish a compositional difference , a half-life comparison may be done using different doses if the purpose is to establish a difference in property . In fact , Aventis argues , it is more appropriate to use the `` clinically relevant dose '' of each compound to demonstrate a difference in property . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As a preliminary matter , it appears that Aventis 's argument would require us , at least in part , to revisit our prior holding on materiality . The essence of Aventis 's argument is that the reason that Dr. Uzan did not disclose the dosage of the prior art compound in his half-life comparisons is that the comparisons were not being used to show a compositional difference and , therefore , the dosage information was not material . We have previously determined , however , that the dosage information was material to patentability . Aventis II , 176 Fed.Appx . at 122 . Nevertheless , because materiality and intent to deceive are necessarily intertwined , Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson , 745 F.2d 1437 , 1455 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) , we will consider the merits of Aventis 's argument with respect to deceptive intent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Aventis contends that the district court made two clearly erroneous findings of fact : ( 1 ) that the central question relating to patentability was compositional differences , and ( 2 ) that the purpose of Dr. Uzan 's half-life comparisons was to show compositional differences . According to Aventis , coursing throughout the district court 's opinion is the notion that the central question relating to patentability was compositional differences . During oral argument , Aventis emphasized that the district court referred to compositional differences nineteen times in its opinion . Oral Arg . at 3:9-3:17 , available at http : //www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oralarguments/mp3/2007-1280.mp3 . As an example , Aventis quoted the court : _NEWLINE_ Thus , the central question throughout the prosecution of the ¡¬618 patent was whether the [ claimed ] and [ the ] EP ¡¬144 LMWH products were compositionally different . _NEWLINE_ *1345 Id . at 10:50-11:03 ; see Aventis III , 475 F.Supp.2d at 982 . Aventis thus contends that the district court erroneously concluded that anticipation was the only rejection of record , even though there was an obviousness rejection present throughout prosecution . Moreover , Aventis asserts that the district court erred in concluding that the `` issue of obviousness necessarily folds into , and is subsumed , by inherency . '' Aventis III , 475 F.Supp.2d at 982 n. 10 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We find nothing in the district court 's opinion to suggest that it did not recognize the existence of the obviousness rejection , or that it believed the anticipation rejection to be the only rejection of record . Indeed , several statements in the opinion clearly indicate that the court was aware of the obviousness rejection . Id . at 980 ( `` It also relied on [ the claimed composition 's ] properties to rebut obviousness . `` ) , ( `` [ B ] ecause the ratio identified by [ the claimed ] LMWH exhibited superior properties over EP ¡¬144 , the inventive formulation could neither be inherent nor obvious . `` ) , ( `` This signaled to Aventis that its reliance on biochemical properties held promise for overcoming both the [ primary examiner 's ] inherency and obviousness rejections . '' ) ( emphases added ) . Although the court incorrectly suggested , in a footnote , that obviousness is subsumed by inherency , we see this as merely a recognition by the court that the notion of inherency was part and parcel of the examiner 's rejections . Id . at 979 . In other words , the properties of a compound are inherent in its composition and , therefore , a difference in property could successfully demonstrate a difference in composition . Id . The court understood that , based on the information available to her , the examiner viewed the patented composition and the EP ¡¬144 composition to be inherently the same , or nearly the same , and , because the Patent Office did not have the facilities to test the products , the examiner invited Aventis to provide evidence of a difference in property to show a compositional difference . Id . at 980 ; see In re Best , 562 F.2d 1252 , 1255 ( CCPA 1977 ) . We find no clear error in the district court 's ultimate conclusion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Aventis next contends that the district court clearly erred in finding that the purpose of Dr. Uzan 's half-life comparison was to show compositional differences to address the anticipation rejection under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 . Instead , Aventis argues , the MW distribution analysis in the first Uzan declaration , showing a difference between the claimed compounds and those disclosed in EP ¡¬144 in the proportion of chains of a given MW , was directed to the anticipation rejection ; the half-life comparisons were directed to the obviousness rejection . Further , Aventis contends , Dr. Uzan 's statement at the end of the declaration that `` the formulations of [ EP ¡¬144 ] are outside the scope of the claimed invention , '' was based on the MW distribution analysis , not the half-life comparisons . According to Aventis , the district court improperly concluded that Aventis could not establish compositional differences with the MW distribution analysis , so it relied instead on the half-life comparisons to show that the compounds were not identical . In support , Aventis quotes the court 's opinion : _NEWLINE_ But Aventis could not successfully distinguish [ the patented compound ] merely by appealing to [ its ] ratio of number average and weight average molecular weights . The EP ¡¬144 patent is not limited by a specific ratio of constituents . Rather it employs open claim language `` comprising various proportions of particular molecular weight products . '' Therefore , Aventis attacked sameness based on a difference in properties . _NEWLINE_ Oral Arg . at 14:21-14:52 ( quoting Aventis III , 475 F.Supp.2d at 980 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1346 We can not agree that the district court clearly erred in its determination that the half-life comparisons were , at least in part , intended to show compositional differences . Nothing in example 6 suggests that the half-life comparison was designed to show only non-obviousness and not lack of identity . The beginning of the example merely states : `` This example illustrates the increase in stability , in vivo , of the mixtures of the invention , expressed by their plasma half-life . '' ¡¬618 patent , col. 9 , ll . 33-35 . Moreover , the first Uzan declaration does not clearly delineate between evidence intended to address the anticipation rejection and evidence intended to address the obviousness rejection . All of the evidence directed to the EP ¡¬ 144 reference appears in ? 8 of the declaration , without distinction between the ¡± 102 and the ¡± 103 aspects of the rejection , and there is no basis for concluding that the final statement in ? 8- '' Thus , the formulations of [ EP ¡¬144 ] are clearly outside the scope of the present invention '' -refers only to the MW distribution data and not to the half-life data . We likewise reject Aventis 's contention that the court did not recognize that the half-life comparisons were , in part , intended to demonstrate nonobviousness . In fact , immediately following the portion of the opinion quoted by Aventis , the court continued : `` It also relied on [ the claimed composition 's ] properties to rebut obviousness . '' Aventis III , 475 F.Supp.2d at 980 . In addition , the court , in reference to a statement by the examiner in the second office action , observed , `` This signaled to Aventis that its reliance on biochemical properties held promise for overcoming both the [ primary examiner 's ] inherency and obviousness rejections . '' Id . Therefore , we conclude that the district court properly found that the half-life comparisons were intended to address both the anticipation and obviousness rejections , and , to the extent that they were intended to address the anticipation rejection , the failure to disclose the dosage information evidenced intent to deceive.8 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Aventis further contends that , in the third office action , the examiner withdrew the ¡± 102 rejection and maintained only the ¡± 103 rejection over EP ¡¬144 . Yet , Aventis asserts , it was not until the second Uzan declaration , which was submitted after the third office action , that Dr. Uzan provided a statistical analysis showing that the half-life differences were statistically significant . Hence , Aventis urges , the examiner clearly withdrew the ¡± 102 rejection based on the MW distribution data , and the half-life data in the second Uzan declaration was intended only to overcome the ¡± 103 rejection . Aventis thus avers that the district court erred in concluding that the anticipation rejection was still pending at the time of the third office action . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court apparently came to the conclusion that the anticipation rejection was still pending because the rejection had not been expressly withdrawn.9 *1347 Id . at 982 n. 9 . Although the court may have erred in concluding that the anticipation rejection was still pending in the third office action , that conclusion was not critical to the court 's ultimate determination that there was intent to deceive . In fact , as explained by the court : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Even if the Court were to accept as true Aventis ' [ s ] unlikely contention that , by the time of Dr. Uzan 's Second Declaration , the [ primary examiner ] had conceded that the [ claimed ] and EP ¡¬144 products were different , there can be no question that inherency was the central , dispositive question up to that point . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 982 . Therefore , even if anticipation were not at issue at the time of the third office action , the court still concluded , based on evidence prior to the third office action , that there was deceptive intent . Any error by the court in concluding that anticipation was still at issue in the third office action does not override the evidence of intent to deceive based on the failure to disclose dosage information in the half-life comparisons in example 6 of the specification and in the first Uzan declaration , both of which were submitted prior to the third office action . We can not agree that the court clearly erred in its factual findings prior to the third office action and in its determinations with respect to intent to deceive based thereon . _NEWLINE_ In sum , we find that the district court did not clearly err in determining that the half-life comparisons were , in part , intended to show compositional differences to address the anticipation rejection under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 and , therefore , rejecting Aventis 's argument that they were intended only to show differences in property , such that dosage information was immaterial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ Aventis next argues that the district court clearly erred in excluding evidence that comparison of half-lives at different doses was the standard practice in the LMWH field . The `` clinically relevant dose , '' Aventis avers , is the standard dose for comparison of half-lives , and every contemporaneous publication comparing half-lives did so at the clinically relevant doses , even though those doses may have differed . Aventis contends that Dr. Uzan selected the 40 mg dose for the patented compound and the 60 mg dose for the EP ¡¬144 compound because they were the clinically relevant doses . According to Aventis , the 40 mg dose for the patented compound was the approved dose for its most important indication , namely , prevention of deep venous thrombosis ( `` DVT '' ) during high-risk orthopedic surgery . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court excluded the evidence of industry practice because it determined that such evidence was irrelevant to the reasonableness of Dr. Uzan 's nondisclosure . Id . at 975 n. 6 . We find no abuse of discretion by the court 's exclusion of the evidence . First , evidence of industry practice of clinically-relevant doses would only be pertinent if there was a finding that the half-life comparisons were used to address obviousness , and not anticipation , because Aventis has conceded that half-life comparisons must be at the same dose to show compositional differences . Here , however , the district court found , and we have affirmed , that the half-life comparisons were at least in part intended to show compositional differences to address the anticipation rejection . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , the district court , after examining all of the evidence , found *1348 it simply incredible that Dr. Uzan selected the clinically relevant doses for his half-life comparisons . In particular , the court noted that neither the claims nor the specification were limited to prevention of DVT in high-risk surgical patients and that the patented composition could be used at several different doses for several different indications ; 10 that there was not nearly as significant a difference , or no difference at all , in half-life when any other dose ( i.e. , 20 mg , 60 mg , or 80 mg ) of the patented compound was compared to the 60 mg dose of EP ¡¬144 ; and that there was no evidence corroborating Dr. Uzan 's testimony that he selected the 40 mg dose due to its efficacy in preventing DVT.11 Id . at 986-89 . Evidence of industry practice using clinically relevant doses would have no impact on the court 's credibility determination with respect to whether Dr. Uzan intended the clinically relevant doses in this case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Therefore , we can not agree that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence that comparison of half-lives at different doses to demonstrate a difference in property was routine practice in the LMWH field . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C _NEWLINE_ Aventis advances several additional arguments focused on whether Dr. Uzan really had deceptive intent . First , Aventis argues that the court erred in not considering exculpatory testimony by Dr. Uzan indicating that he believed that he informed the examiner that he was comparing half-lives at different doses when he stated , in the first Uzan declaration : `` [ T ] his represents an increase in 250 % in the half life and is very significant because it enables the same effect to be achieved with lower dosages . '' This court already concluded in the prior appeal , `` that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Dr. Uzan did not disclose in this statement that the comparison was made using data from different doses . '' Aventis II , 176 Fed.Appx . at 121 . We left open the possibility , however , that Dr. Uzan may have intended by this statement to convey to the examiner that the half-life comparisons were done at different doses . Id . at 121 n. 2 . The district court heard Dr. Uzan 's testimony and considered it along with all other evidence relevant to deceptive intent , yet determined that it did not outweigh the cumulative evidence evincing an intent to deceive . We can not find that the district court clearly erred in concluding that other evidence outweighed Dr. Uzan 's testimony that he intended by this statement to inform the examiner that the half-life comparisons were done at different doses . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Next , Aventis avers that Dr. Uzan did not fail to disclose the dosage information for the patented compound to the examiner . In example 6 , Aventis urges , Dr. Uzan provided half-life data for the patented compound at 60 mg as well as at 40 mg ; and , in the second Uzan declaration , he attached the raw half-life data for the patented compound in Table XI , which *1349 showed that the half-life of the patented compound was less at a 60 mg dose than at the 40 mg dose that was used in the comparison with the EP ¡¬144 compound . Even if we acknowledge that half-life data at other doses for the patented compound were provided to the examiner , the data were provided in a very misleading way . Paragon Podiatry Lab. , Inc. v. KLM Labs. , Inc. , 984 F.2d 1182 , 1191 ( Fed.Cir.1993 ) ( inference of deceptive intent may arise from misleading character of affidavit ) ; accord B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Aircraft Braking Sys . Corp. , 72 F.3d 1577 , 1585 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) . In example 6 , half-life data for the patented compound at the 4 1/2 hour cut-off , which could be readily compared to the 4 1/2 hour cut-off data for the EP ¡¬144 compound , were only provided at the 40 mg dose . In the first Uzan declaration , reference was made only to the half-life comparison at the 4 1/2 hour cut-off , without reference to the dosage of the patented compound . Moreover , Dr. Uzan failed to disclose , in either example 6 or the first Uzan declaration , the dosage information for the EP ¡¬144 compound . Accordingly , we can not conclude that the district court 's finding that Dr. Uzan failed to disclose the dosage information was clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lastly , Aventis contends that Dr. Uzan 's failure to disclose the dosage information was purely due to inadvertence . In support , Aventis relies on other evidence of inadvertent and benign mistakes made during prosecution of the ¡¬618 patent application , suggesting that its omission of the dose of the EP ¡¬144 compound was likewise inadvertent . For example , Aventis points out that the first Uzan declaration mistakenly stated that the claimed compound had 1.5 % of chains below a specified MW , whereas the remarks by Aventis in its response stated 31.5 % of the chains . Here , however , in contrast to any inadvertent omissions made during prosecution , there is sufficient evidence of concealment to warrant a determination that the dose information was intentionally withheld . The fact that Aventis made other inadvertent errors during prosecution has no bearing on this material failure to disclose . Therefore , we can not agree that the district court clearly erred by not concluding that Dr. Uzan 's failure to disclose the dosage information was due to mere inadvertence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we affirm the district court 's finding of inequitable conduct and holding of unenforceability of the ¡¬618 and ¡¬743 patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ RADER , Circuit Judge , dissenting . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court today affirms the unenforceability of a patent due to inequitable conduct . To my eyes , this record does not show clear and convincing evidence of intent to deceive the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) . Moreover , my reading of our case law restricts a finding of inequitable conduct to only the most extreme cases of fraud and deception . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Without doubt , candor and truthful cooperation are essential to an ex parte examination system . With burgeoning application rates , the USPTO must rely on applicant submissions to narrow the prior art search . And , of course , those submissions must be reliable . The threat of inequitable conduct , with its `` atomic bomb '' remedy of unenforceability , ensures that candor and truthfulness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although designed to facilitate USPTO examination , inequitable conduct has taken on a new life as a litigation tactic . The allegation of inequitable conduct opens new avenues of discovery ; impugns the integrity of patentee , its counsel , and the *1350 patent itself ; excludes the prosecuting attorney from trial participation ( other than as a witness ) ; and even offers the trial court a way to dispose of a case without the rigors of claim construction and other complex patent doctrines . This court has even observed a number of cases , such as this one , that arrive on appeal solely on the basis of inequitable conduct where the trial court has apparently elected to try this issue in advance of the issues of infringement and validity . See , e.g. , Frazier v. Roessel Cine Photo Tech , Inc. , 417 F.3d 1230 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ; Semiconductor Energy Lab . Co. v. Samsung Elecs . Co. , 204 F.3d 1368 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This phenomenon is not new or unprecedented . At an earlier time , the Federal Circuit also observed that inequitable conduct as a litigation strategy had become a `` plague . '' Burlington Indus . v. Dayco Corp. , 849 F.2d 1418 , 1422 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) . In response , this court took a case to reduce abuse of inequitable conduct . Kingsdown Med . Consultants , Ltd. v. Hollister , Inc. , 863 F.2d 867 , 876 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( en banc ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In light of the rejuvenation of the inequitable conduct tactic , this court ought to revisit occasionally its Kingsdown opinion . Kingsdown claimed a two-piece ostomy device . Id . at 869 . The examiner rejected claim 50 as indefinite . Id . at 870 . In response , Kingsdown amended claim 50 . Id . Then , later in the prosecution , Kingsdown copied the rejected claim 50 , not the amended version , into a continuation application as new claim 43 . Id . at 870-71 . The once rejected , now recopied claim 43 matured into claim 9 of U.S. Patent No . 4,460,363 . Id . at 871 . On the basis of this error that certainly called into question the integrity of the examination system , the district court found inequitable conduct . Id . at 871-72 . This court , en banc , reversed . Id . at 877 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Kingsdown , this court clearly conveyed that the inequitable conduct was not a remedy for every mistake , blunder , or fault in the patent procurement process . Even mistakes that struck at the heart and integrity of the process-like repeatedly recopying and acquiring rights to a rejected claim-did not amount to inequitable conduct . Instead this court required `` culpable '' conduct supported by clear and convincing evidence of intent to deceive the USPTO . Halliburton Co. v. Schlumberger Tech . Corp. , 925 F.2d 1435 , 1443 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) ( citing Consol . Aluminum Corp. v. Foseco Int ' l Ltd. , 910 F.2d 804 , 809 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ) . At the same time , it is hard to imagine a more material mistake than reasserting claims to rejected subject matter . Materiality of any undisclosed or misleading information , of course , is the other prong of an inequitable conduct analysis . Cargill , Inc. v. Canbra Foods , Ltd. , 476 F.3d 1359 , 1363 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . In sum , Kingsdown properly made inequitable conduct a rare occurrence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ More recently , however , the judicial process has too often emphasized materiality almost to the exclusion of any analysis of the lofty intent requirement for inequitable conduct . Merging intent and materiality at levels far below the Kingsdown rule has revived the inequitable conduct tactic . For example , in Nilssen v. Osram Sylvania , Inc. , 504 F.3d 1223 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) , one of the reasons this court upheld a judgment of unenforceability for an exaggerated claim of small entity status . Nilssen entered into agreements with Philips Electronics North America Corp. ( `` Philips '' ) to license the patents in suit . Id . at 1227-28 . Because Phillips had more than 500 employees , the district court found that Nilssen had made several improper small entity maintenance fee payments to the USPTO . Id . at 1228 . This court affirmed , stating : `` [ w ] e therefore affirm the district court 's decision finding that all of *1351 the patents in suit are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct in improperly claiming small entity status . '' Id . at 1233 . In General Electro Music Corp. v. Samick Music Corp. , 19 F.3d 1405 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) , this court upheld unenforceability under circumstances that are even harder to reconcile with the en banc Kingsdown rule . The mistake in that case involved a petition to make special . Id . at 1407 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The applicant sought expedited examination of its application on the ground that the claimed invention was being infringed . Id . At that time , such a request required an oath or declaration that the applicant made a careful and thorough search of the prior art . Id . The applicant submitted that declaration , but later conceded that it actually had only conducted an informal search as opposed to a formal search . Id . This process did not result in the issuance of rejected claims , but involved nothing more than an expedited examination . Still this miscarriage rendered the entire patent unenforceable . Id . at 1412 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While the case at bar does not feature small entity status or expedited examination , the record still does not , in the context of Kingsdown , show a clear and convincing intent to deceive . We are cognizant of the high standard of review . To overturn a discretionary ruling of a district court , the appellant must establish that the ruling is based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact or a misapplication or misinterpretation of applicable law or that the ruling evidences a clear error of judgment . Kingsdown , 863 F.2d at 876 . While the standard of review is high , it is not insurmountable . Where the district court made clear error of fact , this court must overturn such a determination . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In this case , Dr. Uzan , Associate Director of Biological Research at Aventis , assisted in the prosecution of the application that led to U.S. Patent No . 5,389,618 ( ¡¬618 ) covering a low molecular weight heparin mixture invented by Roger Debrie ( Debrie LMWH ) . Specifically , Dr. Uzan assembled data from various clinical studies comparing the half-lives of the Debrie LMWH to a prior art LMWH invented by Mardiguian ( Mardiguian LMWH ) . Dr. Uzan submitted this data , from the Duchier study and the Foquet study respectively , as example 6 of the patent . In submitting the data , Dr. Uzan did not draw attention to the different doses in those studies . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Without question , Dr. Uzan should have disclosed the dosage of the Mardiguian LMWH in example 6 subsection 3 . Unfortunately , the Foquet study chart that Dr. Uzan used did not show the dosage information . Dr. Uzan neglected to add the information . To make it clear , Dr. Uzan did not attempt to conceal data that were otherwise present . Rather he just submitted the study without adding to the disclosure . This omission , even if negligent , is hardly Kingsdown 's culpable intent to deceive . Moreover this omission strikes less at the integrity of the system than issuance of a rejected claim , which Kingsdown sanctioned . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Likewise , Dr. Uzan ought to have disclosed to the USPTO that he compared the 60 mg dose of the prior art Mardiguian LMWH to the 40 mg dose of the Debrie LMWH in the declaration he submitted on March 29 , 1993 . Dr. Uzan testified that the different dose `` did not come to his mind . '' In context , this explanation has merit . Dr. Uzan was asked to compare the superior pharmacokinetic properties of the Debrie LMWH over the Mardiguian LMWH prior art compound . Comparison of drug properties at their clinically relevant ( and different ) dosages is , of course , completely appropriate . Again , this oversight may have been careless , but hardly culpable . To my eyes , Dr. Uzan 's negligence *1352 does not rise to the level of intent to deceive , particularly in comparison with Kingsdown . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Even a cursory review of example 6 shows no dosage indications . The Debrie LMWH in subsection 1 indicates two dosages . Dosage is an element in subsections 2 and 4 as well . Thus , the absence of a dosage in subsection 3 is blatantly obvious . Surely if Dr. Uzan had intended to deceive the USPTO , he would not have made this omission so conspicuous . Moreover , I find it difficult to fathom that a scientist of Dr. Uzan 's caliber and reputation would engage in such deception . As the district court points out , Dr. Uzan has had a magnificent fifty year career with Aventis , has published over 350 scientific articles and has received numerous prestigious awards including the Galien Research Prize , France 's highest award for drug discovery . This world-class scientist would hardly risk his reputation and tarnish his brilliant career for a single example in the prosecution of a patent for an invention in which he was not even involved . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The inadvertence in this case presents another difficulty for a finding of intent to deceive . The omissions and prosecution errors were committed by two individuals , Dr. Uzan and Mr. Schulman , Aventis ' prosecuting attorney . Collective actions call into question any showing of intent for inequitable conduct . 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.56 refers to the duty of candor and good faith possessed by `` [ e ] ach individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application . '' ( emphasis added ) . Mr. Schulman did not know that the doses of the Debrie LMWH and the Mardiguian LMWH were different . Dr. Uzan admitted that he inadvertently neglected to add that information to the graphs . The dosage information was not on the original Foquet chart submitted to the Aventis patent department and Dr. Uzan neglected to add it . Mr. Schulman had no way of knowing that the comparison was at two different doses and therefore the impropriety of using that data to demonstrate compositional difference . Mr. Schulman 's arguments also carry the markings of a good faith mistake . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Most important , Dr. Uzan himself revealed the error . This candor is inconsistent with deceptive intent . He submitted all of the underlying data to the patent office with his second declaration on June 9 , 1994 . Thus , unlike the situation in Kingsdown , Dr. Uzan corrected the mistake before it resulted in an issued patent . In Dr. Uzan 's second declaration , he clearly articulated that the half-life data showed superior properties of the Debrie LMWH over the prior art Mardiguian LMWH . Still , with all information before the USPTO , the examiner allowed the patent . Lastly , in early 2003 , before filing its infringement suit , Aventis filed a reissue application for the ¡¬618 patent . The patent reissued on June 14 , 2005 with all of the original independent claims , but without example 6 . The half-life data were apparently not even necessary for patentability . The USPTO determined that the Debrie LMWH was inventive over the prior art Mardiguian LMWH without relying on the controversial half-life data from example 6 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The USPTO granted the reissue a day before the district court judge granted Teva and Amphastar 's summary judgment motion that the ¡¬618 patent was unenforceable . Aventis did not have the opportunity to make this argument to the trial judge . This record does not prevent this court , however , from considering all this information in evaluating the inequitable conduct finding . Thus , both materiality and intent seem suspect on this record . In sum , read in the context of Kingsdown , I would reverse *1353 the district court 's determination of inequitable conduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 525 F.3d 1334 , 87 U.S.P.Q.2d 1110 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All responses by Aventis were made by its outside counsel , Mr. Robert Schulman . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The examiner also reiterated that _NEWLINE_ the Patent and Trademark Office does not have facilities for testing and comparing various products , and where the prior art teaches a product which is identical or nearly identical to that claimed , it is incumbent upon the Applicant to convincingly demonstrate that the claimed product provides some unexpected or unobvious property not demonstrated by the prior art products . _NEWLINE_ ( Emphases added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Upon filing a continuing application `` comprising '' was changed to `` consisting essentially of , '' which is how the claim read when it issued . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The examiner reiterated the statement , in a slightly modified form , that _NEWLINE_ the Patent and Trademark Office does not have facilities for testing and comparing various products , and where the prior art teaches a product which is nearly identical to that claimed , it is incumbent upon the Applicant to convincingly demonstrate that the claimed product provides some unexpected or unobvious property not demonstrated by the prior art products . _NEWLINE_ ( Emphases added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Half-life data for the patented compound were contained in Tables I , X , and XI . Half-life data for the EP ¡¬144 compound were contained in Tables A and III . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ One day prior to issuance of the district court 's order , Aventis surrendered the ¡¬618 patent to the PTO pursuant to reissue proceedings in the ¡¬743 patent application . Aventis Pharma S.A. v. Amphastar Pharms. , Inc. , 390 F.Supp.2d 952 , 954 ( C.D.Cal.2005 ) . In a subsequent order , the district court granted Aventis 's motion to substitute the ¡¬ 743 patent for the ¡¬618 patent , and amended its earlier holding of unenforceability to apply also to the ¡¬743 patent . Id . at 957 . In so holding , the district court relied on the well-settled principle articulated in Hoffman-La Roche Inc. v. Lemmon Co. , 906 F.2d 684 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) , that a reissue proceeding can not rehabilitate a patent held to be unenforceable due to inequitable conduct . Id . at 688 . Thus , contrary to the assertion by the dissent , op . at 1352 , the district court was fully aware of the reissue proceeding , yet recognized that any holding of unenforceability in the original application extended to the reissue application . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 7 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We note that in its first appeal , Aventis argued only that Dr. Uzan did not have deceptive intent in failing to disclose the dosage information because he thought he informed the examiner that the comparisons were done at different doses , and because he did provide half-life data for the claimed compound at 60 mg as well as at 40 mg. Aventis II , 176 Fed.Appx . at 123 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 8 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Aventis further argues that the district court erroneously imputed to Dr. Uzan arguments made by Aventis 's attorney , Mr. Schulman , in response to the examiner 's rejections . While it is indeed true that Mr. Schulman represented to the examiner that the difference in half-life indicated that the compositions were different , we find nothing to suggest that the district court relied entirely , or in large part , on Mr. Schulman 's statements in determining that Dr. Uzan intended to deceive the examiner by his failure to disclose the dosage information in his half-life comparisons . Instead , we find that the court 's conclusion rested almost entirely on example 6 of the specification and on the first Uzan declaration . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 9 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Notably , the examiner did expressly withdraw other prior art rejections . Also , the examiner stated that the rejection over EP ¡¬144 was `` repeated for the reasons of record , '' and reiterated that any properties were considered to be inherent in the prior art compounds , making the record somewhat ambiguous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 10 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Aventis disputes this finding by the district court , relying on In re Chupp , 816 F.2d 643 , 646 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) , for the proposition that a compound need not excel over a prior art compound in all properties to be patentable . However , whether a superior property need be demonstrated throughout the entire claim scope in order to show nonobviousness of a claimed product over a prior art product is a separate question from whether there was deceptive intent in failing to disclose material dosage information in a comparison between the claimed product and the prior art product when there is nothing in the claims or specification to suggest that the dosage of the claimed product was the dosage used for a particular purpose . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 11 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court further noted that the 60 mg dose of the EP ¡¬144 composition was the only dose for which there was half-life data available . Aventis III , 475 F.Supp.2d at 984 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

( collectively , `` Shire '' ) for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos . 5,770,193 and 5,759,830 . The ¡¬ 193 and ¡¬830 patents are directed to three-dimensional scaffolding for growing cells in vitro to produce organ tissue in vivo . Following the district court 's construction of the terms `` vascularized organ tissue '' and `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue '' and its determination that the term `` three-dimensional scaffold '' was not indefinite , the parties stipulated to a final judgment of validity and infringement . For the reasons below , we affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ In the field of organ transplantation , surgeons face the challenge of donor scarcity in addition to the technical complexity of transplanting whole or segmented organs into organ recipients . Given the limited availability of implantable organs , scientists have developed methods of growing artificial organ tissue in vitro1 by seeding cells onto support structures , known as scaffolds or matrices . These scaffolds are engineered to allow cells to attach and grow , while enabling the diffusion of vital cell nutrients to the cells to contribute to the growth of new functional tissue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Before the inventions of the asserted patents , scientists created organ tissue with scaffolds made of either `` permanent '' synthetic polymers or biodegradable , non-synthetic materials like collagen . Preferably , these scaffolds eventually would be absorbed by the body , leaving behind the newly formed tissue . With the former method , however , the `` permanent '' synthetic matrix could not be absorbed by the body . Drawbacks of the latter collagen-based matrix included the inability to control the collagen structure 's configuration and the variable absorption of the collagen matrix by the surrounding tissue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It was also generally understood that in engineering thick organs , like a liver or pancreas , the cells at the center of the *1114 artificial structure tended to die as the cell density increased . This was due to the decreased diffusion rate of oxygen and nutrients to the inner cells at the center of the growing structure . These prior art methods of tissue engineering , therefore , were primarily used to make thinner organs such as artificial skin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the face of these challenges , the inventors of the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830 patents , Drs . Vacanti and Langer , developed biodegradable , synthetic matrices that provide support for cell growth and enhance the formation of blood vessels ( i.e. , vascularization ) of the growing cell mass after implantation . The specifications of the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830 patents state that `` [ t ] he design and construction of the scaffolding is of primary importance , '' and that the scaffolding must be `` shaped to maximize surface area to allow adequate diffusion of nutrients and growth factors to the cells . '' ¡¬193 patent col. 6 ll . 25-27 ; ¡¬830 patent col. 10 ll . 12-15 . While the prior art methods were generally used to grow only artificial skin , the scaffolding of the claimed invention can support the growth of organs with varying thicknesses . Indeed , the specifications describe that an object of the invention is to `` provid [ e ] a variety of organs , including skin , liver , kidneys , blood vessels , nerves , and muscles which functionally resemble the naturally occurring organ . '' ¡¬193 patent col. 3 ll . 9-13 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬193 and ¡¬830 patents claim three-dimensional , synthetic , biodegradable structures for growing tissue for vascularized organs as well as methods for creating those structures . MIT brought suit against Shire in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts , alleging that Shire 's sale of its Dermagraft ( r ) scaffold infringes claims 1-4 , 6-9 , and 15-16 of the ¡¬193 patent and claims 1-4 , 6 , and 8 of the ¡¬830 patent . Claim 1 of the ¡¬830 patent is illustrative and recites the following , with emphasis given to the disputed terms : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A cell-scaffold composition prepared in vitro for growing cells to produce functional vascularized organ tissue in vivo , comprising : _NEWLINE_ a fibrous three-dimensional scaffold composed of fibers of a biocompatible , biodegradable , synthetic polymer ; and _NEWLINE_ cells derived from a vascularized tissue attached in vitro to the surface of the fibers of the scaffold uniformly throughout the scaffold ; _NEWLINE_ wherein the fibers of the scaffold provide sufficient surface area to permit attachment in vitro of an amount of the cells effective to produce the functional vascularized organ tissue in vivo ; _NEWLINE_ wherein the fibers of the scaffold are spaced apart such that the maximum distance over which diffusion of nutrients and gases must occur through a mass of cells attached to the fibers is between 100 and 300 microns ; and _NEWLINE_ wherein the diffusion provides free exchange of nutrients , gases and waste to and from the cells uniformly attached to the fibers of the scaffold and proliferating throughout the scaffold in an amount effective to maintain cell viability throughout the scaffold in the absence of vascularization . _NEWLINE_ '830 patent col. 24 ll . 23-46 ( emphases added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shire 's accused Dermagraft ( r ) scaffold uses a synthetic , bioabsorbable scaffold seeded with connective tissue cells called fibroblasts to grow the dermis ( or inner ) layer of skin for `` the treatment of full-thickness diabetic foot ulcers . '' J.A . 1004 . Product literature for Dermagraft ( r ) describes that `` [ d ] uring the manufacturing process , the human fibroblasts are seeded onto a bioabsorbable polyglactin mesh *1115 scaffold . '' Id . After seeding onto the Dermagraft ( r ) scaffold , `` [ t ] he fibroblasts proliferate to fill the interstices of this scaffold and secrete human dermal collagen , matrix proteins , growth factors and cytokines , to create a three-dimensional human dermal substitute containing metabolically active , living cells . '' Id . The fibroblasts attach to the top , bottom , and sides of the fibers of the mesh scaffolding that , after implantation , is gradually absorbed by the surrounding tissue . According to MIT , Shire uses a three-dimensional , synthetic , biodegradable scaffold to grow vascularized organ tissue and thus infringes the asserted claims of the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830 patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ The parties dispute whether prosecution history disclaimer applies to the asserted claims . In particular , Shire argues that prosecution disclaimers apply to the terms `` vascularized organ tissue '' and `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue . '' Prosecution of the asserted patents began with their parent application , U.S . Application Serial No . 06/933,018 , filed in 1986 and abandoned in 1989 . The ¡¬193 patent , a continuation of the parent , and the ¡¬830 patent , a continuation-in-part of the parent , both issued in 1998 . During the intervening years , MIT 's strategy shifted in response to the examiners ' prior art rejections , and the claim language evolved over the course of prosecution . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As originally filed , the pending claims in the ¡¬018 application were directed to : _NEWLINE_ [ P ] roviding a matrix formed of a biocompatible material , wherein said matrix is used to support cell growth in a nutrient solution , said matrix being configured to allow adequate diffusion of nutrients from the nutrient solution to all of the cells so as to maintain cell growth and proliferation to form a three dimensional cell-matrix structure . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 22231-32 . An examiner rejected the ¡¬018 application 's claims based on prior art that , according to the examiner , `` shows a tissue culture method on a carrier as claimed . '' J.A . 22212 . In 1988 , during an examiner interview in response to the prior art rejection , MIT explained that the prior art was directed to skin substitutes . In particular , MIT described the prior art as `` limited to extremely thin pieces of collagen matrix for use in preparing skin substitutes , which could not be used to create organ equivalents . '' J.A . 22234 . This interview summary further explained that `` although porous structures for implantation have been made in the past , the pores have not allowed adequate diffusion through the matrix material between the environment and the attached cells to support the growth and proliferation of cells on the interior of the matrix material unless the dimensions of the matrix were very small . '' J.A . 22238 . At the same time , MIT sought to amend the claims to recite a `` matrix having adequate surface area to provide surfaces of attachment for a cell suspension and a geometric configuration to uniformly support cell growth in a nutrient solution . '' J.A . 22231-32 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dr. Vacanti , a co-inventor on the asserted patents , submitted a declaration in 1989 in support of allowance of the ¡¬018 application , explaining that the prior art methods relied on by the examiner to reject the claims were `` limited to a very thin layer of cells , principally serving as skin substitutes . '' J.A . 22268 . He described the `` key difference '' between the claims and prior art as `` the design of a polymer scaffold which provides adequate sites for attachment and growth of enough cells to survive and function in vivo yet does not limit survival and growth of cells adjacent to the matrix surface as cells increase in number in vitro . '' Id . Dr. Vacanti further emphasized the `` general applicability '' of the invention , *1116 which may be `` use [ d ] with different cell types . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response , the examiner maintained his rejections of the ¡¬018 application 's claims over prior art disclosing skin substitutes , dismissing MIT 's argument that `` the claimed method is not a method for making very thin structures . '' J.A . 22313 . The examiner explained that the `` claims herein are not exclusive to methods involving only thick structures . '' Id . At that time , the claims did not include a thickness limitation and were directed to : _NEWLINE_ An artificial matrix for controlled cell growth in a nutrient solution comprising : a biocompatible matrix configured to provide points of attachment for a cell suspension , said matrix being configured to uniformly support cell growth in a nutrient solution , having sufficient area to allow adequate diffusion of nutrients , elimination of waste , and adequate gas exchange from the nutrient solution to all of the cells such that , in the absence of a vascular network , sufficient cellular growth and differentiation can occur to form a three dimensional cell-matrix structure . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 8142-43 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 1989 , in response to these continued rejections , MIT amended the claims of the ¡¬018 application to limit the claims to scaffolds for growing `` non-skin organ cells . '' J.A . 8142-43 . Likewise , MIT amended the claims in the applications that ultimately issued as the ¡¬830 and ¡¬193 patents to claim , respectively , `` [ a ] biodegradable polymeric support matrix for culturing non-skin organ cells '' and `` [ a ] method for preparing a biodegradable polymeric matrix that serves as a cell culture scaffolding for non-skin organ cells . '' J.A . 1866 , 3735 . The examiner rejected all the new claims in each application under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 , reasoning that the `` non-skin '' limitations constituted new matter that was not supported by the original patent application . For example , the examiner of the ¡¬193 patent application stated : _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 , newly amended , recites an invention that includes `` non-skin '' organ cells . There is no description or teachings of enablement in the present specification of `` non-skin '' organ cells , per se . Consequently , the present specification as filed fails to meet the requirements of 35 USC 112 , first paragraph with respect to `` non-skin '' organ cells . The term `` non-skin '' in claim 1 is deemed to be new matter . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 3768 ( '193 patent ) ; see also J.A . 8166 ( same rejection for ¡¬ 830 patent ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ MIT then withdrew the `` non-skin '' amendments for the asserted patents . J.A . 2272-73 , 3774-75 , 8173-74 . In doing so , MIT emphasized that `` no one , prior to applicants , recognized that the free diffusion of nutrients and gases , as opposed to cells , in combination with structure and sufficient attachment sites for the number of cells required to replace lost function , was essential to the formation of an organ replacement . '' J.A . 3789 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ MIT abandoned the ¡¬018 parent application and continued to prosecute the applications that ultimately issued as the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830 patents . At the time , MIT 's claims included a limitation directed to the thickness of the claimed cell mass . For example , claim 1 of the ¡¬193 patent recited `` [ a ] method for preparing cell-matrix structures comprising : determining the thickness through which nutrients and oxygen can diffuse through an animal cell mass for attachment and survival of the cells throughout the cell mass , wherein the dimensions of the cell mass are greater than 300 microns . '' J.A . 1638 . The examiner rejected the claims under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 , first paragraph , asserting that `` [ t ] he original specification fails [ to ] contain adequate support for steps a ) and b ) of claim 1 , and *1117 for dimensions of a cell mass of greater than 300 microns . '' J.A . 4795 . MIT responded by pointing to support in the specification , stating : _NEWLINE_ Skin is differentiated from organs at page 6 of the application [ i.e. , ¡¬193 patent col. 2 l. 64-col. 3 l. 17 ] , where it is noted that it is considered to be such a thin structure that one does not have the limitations as to free diffusion into the center of the tissue . _NEWLINE_ ... It is clear from the foregoing excerpts from the patent application that construction of matrices for implantation of cells forming organs ( as opposed to skin ) are intended ; it is described that this is only a problem when the diffusion distance to the middle is greater than 200 to 300 microns ; and that volumes of greater than two to three mm3 are intended to be implanted . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 1645 . In that same office action response , MIT distinguished prior art `` directed to formation of a skin substitute '' on the ground that the prior art structure `` has only been used to make relatively thin pieces of skin , not organ structures . '' J.A . 1653 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Later during prosecution , again in response to ¡± 112 rejections of claims with the `` greater than 300 microns '' limitation , MIT stated : _NEWLINE_ The specification identifies the problem to be solved as the need for structures replacing or supplementing tissue function , specifically pancreatic , liver , intestine , heart and skeletal or smooth muscle function ( pages 2-5 ) . The failure of the prior art to meet this need is reviewed at pages 5-6 , noting that the prior art only exemplified skin replacement , not replacement of organs ... . The objects of the invention recited at page 7 make clear that it is the formation of thick organ structures that is the primary goal of the invention . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 1709 . Similarly , in the same office action response , Applicants discussed the prior art reference Yannas , which is directed to skin substitutes : `` [ B ] ecause Yannas , et al . never makes a thick structure , they do not recognize the inherent limitation of their collagen gels which prevent making thick structures , which are essential for making organs but not for making skin replacements . '' J.A . 1716 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In 1997 , when the examiners continued to reject the claims directed to a cell mass greater than 300 microns , MIT removed these thickness limitations from the claims and again shifted its prosecution strategy . Specifically , MIT cancelled the pending independent claims and added claims in both the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830 patents to require that the scaffold be used `` to produce functional vascularized organ tissue in vivo . '' J.A . 4972 , 9116 . In an examiner interview summary , MIT explained that , `` although the [ prior art Yannas ] lattice is uniquely suited for treating skin , it would be unsuitable for carrying out the goal of the claimed invention , especially when applied to vascularized organs , and structures that are thicker than skin . '' J.A . 9125 . MIT further described Yannas as `` suitable for skin repair , or for regenerating nonvascular tissues . '' J.A . 9126 . MIT asserted that Yannas could not , `` without serious modification , be applied to the purposes of the presently claimed invention for producing vascularized tissues and organs . '' J.A . 9126-27 . MIT also cited a report by Yannas himself , which stated that his matrix `` supported regeneration of the epidermis ( i.e. , the outer avascular layer of skin ) on top of the grafted lattices '' but that it `` induced only partial regeneration of the dermis-i.e. , the vascularized component of skin . '' J.A . 9127 . Following minor amendments , the ¡¬193 and ¡¬830 patents issued in 1998 , claiming structures for growing cells to produce functional vascularized *1118 organ tissue and methods for creating those structures . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . _NEWLINE_ During claim construction proceedings in the district court , Shire argued that the term `` vascularized organ tissue '' should be construed to exclude skin as an organ based on various statements made during the prosecution of the asserted patents , discussed above . Shire made similar arguments regarding construction of the term `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue , '' arguing that MIT had made statements during prosecution that limited the term to certain types of cells , namely parenchymal cells and bone forming cells . Shire further argued that the term `` three-dimensional scaffold '' was indefinite under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 . The district court , however , determined that prosecution history disclaimer did not apply and additionally held that the term `` three-dimensional scaffold '' was not indefinite . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following the district court 's claim construction and indefiniteness determinations , Shire stipulated to validity and infringement of the patents-in-suit and dismissed its declaratory judgment counterclaims of invalidity and noninfringement . The district court accordingly entered judgment of validity and infringement , and Shire appealed . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ Shire argues on appeal that the district court erred in construing the term `` vascularized organ tissue '' simply as `` vascularized tissue from an organ '' and in determining that the term `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue '' encompasses `` at least some cells derived from skin . '' See J.A . 3-4 . Shire also challenges the district court 's determination that the term `` three-dimensional '' is not indefinite , as well as its construction of the term `` three-dimensional scaffold '' to mean `` a supporting structure that allows cells to attach along its width , length , and height . '' J.A . 4 . We address each claim limitation in turn below . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ The `` ultimate interpretation '' of a claim term , as well as interpretations of `` evidence intrinsic to the patent ( the patent claims and specifications , along with the patent 's prosecution history ) , '' are legal conclusions , reviewed by this court de novo . Teva Pharm . USA , Inc. v. Sandoz , Inc. , -- - U.S. -- -- , 135 S.Ct . 831 , 841 , -- - L.Ed.2d -- -- ( 2015 ) . `` Subsidiary factual determinations based on extrinsic evidence are reviewed for clear error . '' Info-Hold , Inc. v. Applied Media Techs . Corp. , 783 F.3d 1262 , 1265 ( Fed . Cir . 2015 ) ( citing Teva , 135 S.Ct . at 841 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The purpose of claim construction is to give claim terms the meaning understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of invention . Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1312-14 ( Fed . Cir . 2005 ) ( en banc ) . `` There is a heavy presumption that claim terms are to be given their ordinary and customary meaning . '' Aventis Pharm . Inc. v. Amino Chems . Ltd. , 715 F.3d 1363 , 1373 ( Fed . Cir . 2013 ) . `` Properly viewed , the 'ordinary meaning ' of a claim term is its meaning to the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent . '' Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1321 . A patent 's prosecution history , though `` 'less useful for claim construction purposes ' than the claim language and written description , plays various roles in resolving uncertainties about claim scope . '' SAS Inst. , Inc. v. ComplementSoft , LLC , 825 F.3d 1341 , 1349 ( Fed . Cir . 2016 ) ( quoting Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317 ) . We recognize that `` the prosecution history can often inform *1119 the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention . '' Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1317 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . _NEWLINE_ `` The doctrine of prosecution disclaimer ... preclud [ es ] patentees from recapturing through claim interpretation specific meanings disclaimed during prosecution . '' Omega Eng ' g , Inc. v. Raytek Corp. , 334 F.3d 1314 , 1323 ( Fed . Cir . 2003 ) . `` [ I ] n order for prosecution disclaimer to attach , the disavowal must be both clear and unmistakable . '' 3M Innovative Props . Co. v. Tredegar Corp. , 725 F.3d 1315 , 1325 ( Fed . Cir . 2013 ) . This case therefore requires that we analyze whether statements MIT made during the prosecution of the asserted patents amount to a clear and unmistakable disclaimer limiting the meaning of the claim terms . `` Where the alleged disavowal is ambiguous , or even 'amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations , ' we have declined to find prosecution disclaimer . '' Avid Tech. , Inc. v. Harmonic , Inc. , 812 F.3d 1040 , 1045 ( Fed . Cir . 2016 ) ( quoting Cordis Corp. v. Medtronic AVE , Inc. , 339 F.3d 1352 , 1359 ( Fed . Cir . 2003 ) and citing Omega Eng ' g , 334 F.3d at 1325 ( `` [ W ] e have thus consistently rejected prosecution statements too vague or ambiguous to qualify as a disavowal of claim scope. '' ) ) . `` The party seeking to invoke prosecution history disclaimer bears the burden of proving the existence of a 'clear and unmistakable ' disclaimer that would have been evident to one skilled in the art . '' Trivascular , Inc. v. Samuels , 812 F.3d 1056 , 1063-64 ( Fed . Cir . 2016 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . _NEWLINE_ On the first term , `` vascularized organ tissue , '' the district court determined that there was no clear and unmistakable disclaimer that would exclude skin from the term 's ordinary meaning . The court therefore construed the term `` vascularized organ tissue '' according to its ordinary meaning as `` vascularized tissue from an organ , '' reasoning that because `` the dermal layer of skin contains blood vessels , this term encompasses skin . '' J.A . 3 . We agree with the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shire does not dispute that the ordinary meaning of `` organ '' includes skin . Similarly , the ordinary meaning of `` vascularized organ tissue '' includes skin because skin contains vascularized layers , such as the dermis ( or inner ) layer . As MIT points out , the parties ' Joint Technology Tutorial , provided to the district court as background during claim construction , expressly categorizes skin as an `` organ , '' J.A . 3379 , 3381 , that is `` vascularized , '' J.A . 3383-84 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The patents ' respective specifications also support the district court 's determination that the term `` organ '' includes skin . The specifications explicitly state that `` [ s ] kin is an organ subject to damage by disease or injury '' and that skin is `` considered an 'organ ' of the body . '' ¡¬193 patent col. 2 ll . 31 , 64 ; see also ¡¬830 patent col. 4 ll . 8-9 , 59 . Moreover , the specifications state that `` an object of the present invention '' is `` to provide a method and means for providing a variety of organs , including skin , liver , kidneys , blood vessels , nerves , and muscles which functionally resemble the naturally occurring organ . '' ¡¬193 patent col. 3 ll . 9-13 ( emphasis added ) ; see also ¡¬830 patent col. 5 ll . 10-14 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shire nonetheless argues that skin should be excluded from the construction of `` vascularized organ tissue '' based on certain statements made by MIT during prosecution of the asserted patents ' family . First , Shire pulls out a single sentence from the 1988 interview summary prepared during prosecution of the parent ¡¬018 application , which stated that the asserted prior art `` was limited to extremely thin *1120 pieces of collagen matrix for use in preparing skin substitutes , which could not be used to create organ equivalents . '' J.A . 22234 . These statements , however , were made in the context of different claims that did not include the terms `` vascularized organ tissue '' or even `` organ tissue . '' Rather , the claims were directed to `` providing a matrix formed of a biocompatible material . '' J.A . 22231 . Moreover , the interview summary particularly emphasized that `` a crucial aspect of applicants ' invention '' is that the scaffold 's structure allows `` adequate diffusion through the matrix material between the environment and the attached cells to support the growth and proliferation of cells on the interior of the matrix . '' J.A . 22238 . Reading the selected sentence in the context of the entire summary and the claim terms then at issue reveals that MIT emphasized the structure of the invention 's scaffold , not the type of organ it can be used to grow . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shire also points to Dr. Vacanti 's 1989 declaration submitted during prosecution of the ¡¬018 application when the claims had been amended to require `` determining the distance over which adequate nutrients and oxygen can diffuse through a cell mass having dimensions of greater than 200 microns to maintain viability of the cells on the interior of the cell mass . '' J.A . 2043 . In particular , Shire relies on Dr. Vacanti 's statement that , `` [ w ] hile making skin equivalents does not require the use of thick layers of cells , making functional organs in vivo does . '' J.A . 22268. Review of the then-pending claims and Dr. Vacanti 's declaration in full , however , reveals that he did not distinguish the claims from the prior art on the ground that organs do not include skin . Rather , Dr. Vacanti contrasted the prior art from the then-claimed invention on the ground that the prior art matrices can not support `` cells [ that ] are grown to a thickness greater than the thickness which allows adequate diffusion of oxygen and nutrients to [ the ] inner cells . '' Id . Dr. Vacanti further explained that the claimed polymer matrices can be used `` with different cell types , '' id . and that , while his research focused on growing artificial livers , `` a great strength of our approach is the generic application of knowledge to other organ systems . '' J.A . 22286 . A skilled artisan would not read these statements in context as limiting the invention to any particular organ or as excluding skin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shire also points to Dr. Vacanti 's statement that the prior art methods were `` limited to a very thin layer of cells , '' whereas `` the claimed method is not a method for making very thin structures . '' J.A . 22268 , 2048 . The declaration , however , was filed in support of claim limitations requiring a matrix of a minimum thickness . No such limitation is present in the issued claims . In determining whether a clear and unambiguous disclaimer attaches to particular claim language , it is important to consider the statements made by the applicant both in the context of the entire prosecution history and the then-pending claims . See Ecolab , Inc. v. FMC Corp. , 569 F.3d 1335 , 1342 ( Fed . Cir . 2009 ) ( `` Even if an isolated statement appears to disclaim subject matter , the prosecution history as a whole may demonstrate that the patentee committed no clear and unmistakable disclaimer. '' ) . In the context of the overall prosecution history , the isolated statements plucked from Dr. Vacanti 's declaration do not meet the high standard for prosecution disclaimer to attach . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ MIT 's attempt to add the `` non-skin '' limitation during prosecution of the asserted patents reinforces our conclusion that the asserted claims as issued include skin within their scope . MIT tried to narrow the application claims early in prosecution to exclude skin organ cells , but the examiner rejected the `` non-skin '' limitation under *1121 ¡± 112 as new matter . MIT never again sought to limit the claims to exclude skin organ cells . Had the examiner actually agreed with MIT 's arguments and allowed the proposed amendments , the claims could well have a different claim scope . But the examiner did not , and MIT took a different approach . Since claims to `` vascularized organ tissue '' were ultimately allowed over the prior art without the proposed `` non-skin '' amendment , it is difficult to infer that a skilled artisan would interpret other isolated statements by MIT during the course of the prosecution history as a clear and unmistakable disclaimer of claim scope . Rather , we determine that a skilled artisan , reading the prosecution history as a whole , would conclude that MIT 's invention does in fact cover vascularized skin . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shire also points to a statement made by MIT during prosecution of a related but ultimately abandoned patent application . MIT stated there that `` [ t ] he prior art describes the design of matrices for use as skin replacements , having different requirements than those of thick matrices required for organ function . '' J.A . 1913 . The pending claims , however , required that the `` dimensions of the cell mass are greater than 300 microns . '' J.A . 1972 . Moreover , MIT described the pending claims as directed to `` a method for the design and preparation of a matrix for the creation of thick organ equivalents . '' J.A . 1912 . In context , Shire 's reliance on MIT 's statements is misplaced . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shire similarly identifies statements made in 1995 during prosecution of the ¡¬193 patent to the effect that `` construction of matrices for implantation of cells forming organs ( as opposed to skin ) are intended . '' J.A . 1645 . Again , the pending claim language at that time included a thickness limitation , requiring that the `` dimensions of the cell mass are greater than 300 microns . '' J.A . 1638 . And these remarks were made in response to ¡± 112 rejections in which the examiner stated that the original application lacks support for the thickness limitation . The full passage indicates that MIT was merely showing the examiner where the specification provided support for the claim limitation `` greater than 300 microns '' : _NEWLINE_ Adequate support means that one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to make and use the claimed invention . It is clear from the foregoing excerpts from the patent application that construction of matrices for implantation of cells forming organs ( as opposed to skin ) are intended ; it is described that this is only a problem when the diffusion distance to the middle is greater than 200 to 300 microns ; and that volumes of greater than two to three mm3 are intended to be implanted . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 1645 . MIT thus directed the examiner to written description support in the specification , which describes that `` [ a ] lthough skin is considered to be an 'organ ' of the body , these methods for making artificial skin have not been used to make other types of organs such as a liver or pancreas . '' ¡¬193 patent col. 2 ll . 64-66 . MIT 's remarks were made in the context of a thickness limitation not present in the issued claims and supported the notion that while the prior art was limited to creating artificial skin , the invention is capable of creating skin and also has a broader application . Moreover , several paragraphs later , the specification expressly states that an object of the invention is `` to provide a method and means for providing a variety of organs , including skin . '' Id . col. 3 ll . 9-11 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , Shire points to MIT 's statement that `` the prior art only exemplified skin replacement , not replacement of organs . '' J.A . 1709 . Again , this statement must be *1122 read in context . It was made when the claims included a thickness minimum , and MIT attempted to distinguish the claims on that basis , asserting that `` it is the formation of thick organ structures that is the primary goal of the invention . '' Id . ( emphasis added ) . As such , MIT 's statement can not be read as limiting the ordinary meaning of `` vascularized organ tissue '' in the issued claims , which do not recite a thickness minimum . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with the district court that Shire failed to meet its burden of demonstrating the existence of a `` clear and unmistakable '' disclaimer that would have been evident to one skilled in the art . See Elbex Video , Ltd. v. Sensormatic Elecs . Corp. , 508 F.3d 1366 , 1371-72 ( Fed . Cir . 2007 ) . In the context of the entire prosecution history , the statements that Shire pulls out as alleged disclaimers , regarding claim limitations not present in the issued claims , do not alter or disclaim the ordinary meaning of `` vascularized organ tissue '' as used in the specification . We conclude that the district court properly determined that `` vascularized organ tissue '' includes skin as an organ . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. _NEWLINE_ We also agree with the district court 's construction of `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue '' to include both parenchymal and non-parenchymal ( e.g. , bone-forming ) cells . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The claims themselves do not distinguish between parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells . Shire acknowledges that bone-forming cells , a type of non-parenchymal cell , fall within the claims ' scope . Similarly , Shire 's expert agrees that the ordinary meaning of `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue '' would `` encompass both the parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells . '' J.A . 1320 . In addition , several dependent claims expressly include organs with parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells . For example , claim 11 of the ¡¬193 patent lists smooth muscle cells , which are non-parenchymal stromal cells , not parenchymal cells . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Moreover , the respective specifications do not limit the term `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue '' to parenchymal cells , but instead use the term to also refer to several types of non-parenchymal stromal cells , namely cells forming smooth muscle and blood vessel endothelial cells . E.g. , ¡¬193 patent col. 4 ll . 6-16 , col. 7 ll . 39-42 ; ¡¬830 patent col. 6 ll . 27-34 , col. 7 ll . 51-56 . Shire points out that the specifications `` repeatedly refer to the cells of the invention as 'parenchymal , ' 'functional , ' or cells possessing the 'necessary ' or 'desired ' function . '' Appellant Br . 44 . But Shire has not shown that these descriptions are synonymous , such that the invention should be limited to only parenchymal cells , especially in the face of the broad ordinary meaning of `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue . '' And the specifications ' reference to `` an advantage of the present method '' being `` a means for selective transplantation of parenchymal cells '' does not amount to a clear and unmistakable disclaimer restricting the claims to only parenchymal cells . ¡¬193 patent col. 5 ll . 56-58 ; see also ¡¬830 patent col. 9 ll . 14-18 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , Shire pulls out statements from the prosecution of the ¡¬193 patent and a related patent that it argues disclaim non-parenchymal cells . The pending claims in these patent applications at the time of the statements , however , did not include the limitation in dispute- '' cells derived from a vascularized tissue '' -and do not clearly and unmistakably show that MIT intended to limit the claims at issue to only parenchymal cells . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For example , Shire quotes MIT 's remarks made in response to a double patenting *1123 rejection during prosecution of the ¡¬193 patent . Specifically , MIT stated that `` there are two major differences between what appellants are claiming and the claims '' in Application No . 07/509,952 relating to cartilage , including `` the requirement for chondrocytes rather than parenchymal cells . '' J.A . 1695-96 . At the time of the double patenting rejection , the claims pending in the application that ultimately issued as the ¡¬193 patent did not require the use of `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue , '' and dependent claim 14 specifically recited cells forming cartilage ( chondrocytes ) . J.A . 4672-74 . In response to the double patenting rejection , MIT amended the ¡¬193 application claims to require the formation of `` vascularized tissue '' and removed claim 14 's recitation of cartilage . The statements to which Shire points , therefore , simply distinguished the co-pending ¡¬952 application claims as being limited to cartilage , which is an avascular tissue . A skilled artisan would not read MIT 's statements , which distinguish avascular cartilage from vascularized tissue made with parenchymal cells , as limiting the term `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue '' to parenchymal cells . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shire also points to a statement made during prosecution of another related patent in the family , U.S. Patent No . 5,770,417 , where MIT stated that `` the types of cells described in the application are defined in Medical dictionaries and textbook [ s ] as 'parenchymal ' cells . '' J.A . 1579 . At that time , the application that ultimately issued as the ¡¬417 patent had claims directed to `` cells selected from the group consisting of parenchymal cells from vascularized tissue and cells forming bone . '' J.A . 1598 . This remark was made in response to an indefiniteness rejection , in which the examiner directed MIT to identify support in the specification for the disclosure of `` parenchymal cells from vascularized tissue . '' MIT referenced the specification 's list of types of cells , which included parenchymal cells as well as non-parenchymal stromal cells , in addition to general categories like intestine and kidney cells , which would include both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells . MIT later shifted its prosecution strategy and removed the limitation of parenchymal cells in the claims , electing instead to require that the cells come from a vascularized tissue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After reading the full prosecution history in light of the then-pending claim language , we conclude that a skilled artisan would not read MIT 's statement made during prosecution of the ¡¬417 patent-and directed to very different claim language-as limiting the term `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue '' to parenchymal cells . We , like the district court , determine that the ordinary meaning applies because Shire has not shown that a clear and unmistakable disclaimer attaches to limit the claim scope . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . _NEWLINE_ Finally , Shire appeals the district court 's determination that the term `` three-dimensional scaffold '' is not indefinite , as well as the court 's ultimate construction of the term as `` a supporting structure that allows cells to attach along its width , length , and height . '' J.A . 4 . We affirm the district court 's validity determination and adopt its claim construction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` We review a district court 's ultimate determination that a claim is invalid as indefinite under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 112 ? 2 de novo , although , as with claim construction , any factual findings by the district court based on extrinsic evidence are reviewed for clear error . '' UltimatePointer , L.L.C . v. Nintendo Co. , 816 F.3d 816 , 826 ( Fed . Cir . 2016 ) ( internal footnote *1124 omitted ) .2 A claim is invalid for indefiniteness if its language , when read in light of the specification and the prosecution history , `` fail [ s ] to inform , with reasonable certainty , those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention . '' Nautilus , Inc. v. Biosig Instruments , Inc. , -- - U.S. -- -- , 134 S.Ct . 2120 , 2124 , 189 L.Ed.2d 37 ( 2014 ) . Patents are presumed valid , and the challenger bears the burden of establishing invalidity . See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 ; Nautilus , 134 S.Ct . at 2130 n.10 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Shire asserts that the term `` three-dimensional scaffold '' is indefinite because the intrinsic record provides `` no guidance '' as to the meaning of `` three-dimensional . '' Appellant Br . 64 . The district court rejected this argument and construed the term `` three dimensional '' according to its accepted , ordinary meaning , as confirmed by dictionary definitions . Shire complains that the dictionaries cited by the district court are from the present day and are not technical in nature . Yet Shire does not explain how technical dictionaries or dictionaries contemporaneous to the patents ' filing date would define the term any differently . Moreover , the district court 's construction is consistent with Shire 's own expert 's opinion regarding the term 's ordinary meaning at the time of the invention : _NEWLINE_ [ A ] t the time of the invention , ... a POSA would have had some familiarity with the phrases `` two-dimensional '' and `` three-dimensional '' in the context of growing cells ... . At that time a POSA would have understood the term `` three-dimensional '' as it relates to cell culture to refer to growing cells on and within a structure ... . It is my understanding that a reference to three dimensions was an attempt to contrast this system ( i.e. , growing on and within ) with the more traditional and widely-practiced `` two-dimensional '' conditions in which cells are grown in a single layer , usually on a flat , hard glass or plastic surface . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 1356 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Given the ordinary meaning of `` three-dimensional '' and Shire 's own expert 's description of `` three-dimensional scaffold , '' we agree that the claim language is sufficiently definite under Nautilus . We likewise discern no error in the district court 's construction of `` three-dimensional scaffold '' to mean `` a supporting structure that allows cells to attach along its width , length , and height . '' J.A . 4 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the above reasons , we find no error in the district court 's claim constructions of `` vascularized organ tissue , '' `` cells derived from a vascularized tissue , '' and `` three-dimensional scaffold . '' We affirm its determination that the term `` three-dimensional scaffold '' is not indefinite . Accordingly , we affirm the district court 's judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ O'Malley , Circuit Judge , concurring . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I agree with the majority that the district court did not err either in its construction of the disputed claim terms or in its conclusion that the term `` three-dimensional scaffold '' was not indefinite . Indeed , I believe the district court thoroughly and correctly analyzed all arguments and issues presented . I write separately , however , because I continue to believe that a judgment that is final except for a determination *1125 of damages and willfulness is not a final judgment at all . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ The appellants assert that jurisdiction is proper because `` [ t ] he judgment is 'final except for an accounting . ' `` Appellants ' Br . 1 ( quoting 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) ) . This is apparently so `` because aside from MIT 's request for ( i ) damages and ( ii ) a finding of willful infringement , the judgment disposes of all claims and counterclaims pending in the present case . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Robert Bosch , LLC v. Pylon Manufacturing Corp. , 719 F.3d 1305 ( Fed . Cir . 2013 ) ( en banc ) , we created a broad jurisdictional rule that excepts this court from the rules of finality followed by every other Article III court of appeals . We held that 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) `` confers jurisdiction on this court to entertain appeals from patent infringement liability determinations when a trial on damages has not yet occurred '' or `` when willfulness issues are outstanding and remain undecided . '' Id . at 1317 , 1319 . And while I fully understand that ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) is an exception to the final judgment rule that applies only to patent cases , I do not believe we should have strayed so far from the wise judgment of our sister courts . See id . at 1331 ( O'Malley , J. , dissenting ) ( collecting cases from other circuits holding that the finality requirement applies to outstanding damages determinations ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In declaring this broad , new rule in Bosch , we framed the question as `` whether a trial on damages and willfulness is an accounting for the purposes of ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) '' and , therefore , an `` exception [ ] to the final judgment rule . '' Id . at 1308 . We answered that question by `` conclud [ ing ] ( albeit incorrectly in my view ) that damages and willfulness determinations are sufficiently 'ministerial ' to constitute no more than an 'accounting . ' `` ePlus , Inc. v. Lawson Software , Inc. , 789 F.3d 1349 , 1371 ( Fed . Cir . 2015 ) ( O'Malley , J. , dissenting ) . In so doing , we hammered a square peg into a round hole-these appeals are more properly characterized as interlocutory and are , therefore , improper . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is well established that `` [ t ] he finality requirement ... embodies a strong congressional policy against piecemeal reviews , and against obstructing or impeding an ongoing judicial proceeding by interlocutory appeals . '' United States v. Nixon , 418 U.S. 683 , 690 , 94 S.Ct . 3090 , 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 ( 1974 ) . Yet this court 's continuing practice of allowing parties to appeal judgments where damages and willfulness remain undecided multiplies judicial proceedings by endorsing piecemeal review . See Dow Chem . Co. v. Nova Chems . Corp. ( Canada ) , 809 F.3d 1223 , 1229 ( Fed . Cir . 2015 ) ( `` [ Bosch ] authorized , nay encouraged , parties to engage in piecemeal appeals in patent cases and encouraged district judges to authorize the same . '' ) ( O'Malley , J. , dissenting from denial of petition for rehearing en banc ) . This practice further incentivizes the disruption of district court proceedings by encouraging `` district courts to bifurcate liability determinations from damages and willfulness trials-and all other remedial determinations , '' which will `` drag out the litigation '' in many cases , `` causing multiple appeals and probably multiple remands . '' Fresenius USA , Inc. v. Baxter Int ' l , Inc. , 733 F.3d 1369 , 1381 ( Fed . Cir . 2013 ) ( O'Malley , J. , dissenting from denial of petition for rehearing en banc ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The final judgment rule is invaluable to ensuring the efficient and just resolution of patent disputes . _NEWLINE_ The final judgment rule serves several important interests . It helps preserve the respect due trial judges by minimizing appellate-court interference with the *1126 numerous decisions they must make in the pre-judgment stages of litigation . It reduces the ability of litigants to harass opponents and to clog the courts through a succession of costly and time-consuming appeals . It is crucial to the efficient administration of justice . _NEWLINE_ Flanagan v. United States , 465 U.S. 259 , 263-64 , 104 S.Ct . 1051 , 79 L.Ed.2d 288 ( 1984 ) . Exceptions to that rule are rare and disfavored . The Supreme Court has `` repeatedly stressed , '' in the context of the collateral order doctrine , that a `` 'narrow ' exception should stay that way and never be allowed to swallow the general rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal , to be deferred until final judgment has been entered , in which claims of district court error at any stage of the litigation may be ventilated . '' Dig . Equip . Corp. v. Desktop Direct , Inc. , 511 U.S. 863 , 868 ( 1994 ) . The increasing regularity of appeals taken under ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 2 ) , with damages and willfulness yet to be decided , demonstrates that the exception is indeed swallowing the general rule . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For these reasons , while I understand I am bound by it , I continue to believe that our decision in Bosch was in error . I concur in the result reached by the majority on the merits , but do not believe this court should continue its practice of exercising jurisdiction in cases where , as here , the district court has yet to determine damages and/or willfulness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 839 F.3d 1111 , 120 U.S.P.Q.2d 1492 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In vitro refers to an artificial environment outside of a living organism , such as a test tube or culture .

Apotex , Inc. v. UCB , Inc. , 970 F.Supp.2d 1297 ( S.D.Fla.2013 ) . Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding inequitable conduct , we affirm the district court 's judgment on that basis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . The ¡¬556 Patent _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬556 patent , titled `` Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising Moexipril Magnesium , '' is about ten years old . The patent issued on July 27 , 2004 , from an application that claims priority to a Canadian application filed on April 5 , 2000 . Dr. Bernard Charles Sherman , founder and chairman of Apotex , wrote the ¡¬ 556 patent application and is its sole inventor . Dr. Sherman leads the development of Apotex 's drug formulations and manufacturing processes , and has himself written approximately one hundred patent applications for Apotex . He also directs all litigation for Apotex . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬556 patent is generally directed to a process for manufacturing moexipril tablets . Moexipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme ( `` ACE '' ) inhibitor used to treat hypertension . Like other ACE inhibitors , Moexipril and its acid addition salts ( e.g. , moexipril hydrochloride ) are susceptible to degradation and instability . To improve stability , the ¡¬556 patent discloses a process of making moexipril tablets consisting mostly of moexipril magnesium obtained by reacting moexipril or its acid addition salts with an alkaline magnesium compound . ¡¬556 patent col. 2 ll . 53-56 . This *1356 process is captured in claim 1 , the only independent claim of the ¡¬556 patent : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A process of making a solid pharmaceutical composition comprising moexipril magnesium , said process comprising the step of reacting moexipril or an acid addition salt thereof with an alkaline magnesium compound in a controlled manner in the presence of a sufficient amount of solvent for a predetermined amount of time so as to convert greater than 80 % of the moexipril or moexipril acid addition salt to moexipril magnesium . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the preferred embodiment , moexipril hydrochloride is reacted with magnesium hydroxide or the magnesium salt of a weak acid ( e.g. , magnesium carbonate ) to obtain moexipril magnesium . See id . col. 2 l. 66-col. 3 l. 5 . The ¡¬556 patent explains that the reaction can not be accomplished in dry form and must be carried out in the presence of a solvent . Id . col. 2 ll . 38-45 . After the reaction has occurred and the solvent has evaporated , the dried material can be compressed into tablets . This process is called `` wet granulation '' and has been known in the pharmaceutical industry since at least the 1980s . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . The Prior Art _NEWLINE_ Several methods for stabilizing ACE inhibitors in general , and moexipril in particular , were known in the prior art before Dr. Sherman filed the ¡¬556 patent application . U.S. Patent No . 4,743,450 ( `` the ¡¬450 patent '' ) , which issued in 1998 to Warner-Lambert , discloses a method for stabilizing an ACE inhibitor using alkaline magnesium compounds . ¡¬450 patent col. 3 ll . 25-35 . The examples in the ¡¬450 patent use quinapril as the ACE inhibitor and magnesium carbonate as the alkaline stabilizer . Id . col. 4 l. 58-col. 5 l. 39 . As in the ¡¬556 patent , wet granulation is the preferred technique for processing tablets according to the ¡¬450 patent . Id . col. 4 ll . 26-28 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The two accused products in this case , Univasc and Uniretic , are also prior art to the ¡¬556 patent . Both products are moexipril tablets that have been sold in the United States since 1995 and 1997 , respectively . Univasc and Uniretic are made in accordance with the process described in the ¡¬450 patent , which Defendant UCB , Inc. licenses from Warner-Lambert and has listed in the FDA 's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations ( the `` Orange Book '' ) for both products . The manufacture of Univasc and Uniretic involves the wet granulation of moexipril hydrochloride and magnesium oxide . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬556 patent discusses the ¡¬450 patent and the Univasc product . Specifically , the Background section states that Univasc tablets contain moexipril hydrochloride and magnesium oxide , and are made in accordance with the teachings of the ¡¬450 patent . ¡¬556 patent col. 2 ll . 16-22 . This section also states that the moexipril hydrochloride and alkaline magnesium compound are capable of an acid-base reaction that is difficult to control and results in uncertainty regarding the final composition of the product . Id . col. 2 ll . 31-39 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬556 patent also discusses a 1990 article by Gu et al.1 ( `` the Gu article '' ) , which describes the chemistry involved in stabilizing moexipril . Gu examined the degradation of moexipril after mixing it with alkaline stabilizers in both wet granulation and dry powder mixing ( dry granulation ) , concluding that only wet granulation *1357 stabilizes moexipril . The Gu article theorizes that such stabilization results from `` neutralization '' by the outer surface of the granulated material and also possibly because `` a portion of the moexipril hydrochloride was converted to the cation salts via granulation '' ( i.e. , moexipril magnesium was obtained ) . According to the Background section of the ¡¬556 patent , the Gu article teaches that only a portion ( if any ) of the drug may be converted to moexipril magnesium and that stabilization therefore occurs not because of conversion , but because of the presence of the alkaline stabilizing compound in the final product . ¡¬556 patent col. 2 ll . 4-11 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. The Prosecution History _NEWLINE_ During prosecution before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( `` PTO '' ) , the ¡¬ 556 patent received three obviousness rejections . First , the Examiner rejected the claims based on the combination of the ¡¬450 patent and U.S. Patent No . 4,344,949 , which discloses using moexipril tablets to treat hypertension . In response , Dr. Sherman 's counsel argued that the cited prior art did not disclose a reaction , but disclosed only combining moexipril hydrochloride and an alkaline magnesium compound . In support , counsel submitted the Product Monograph for Univasc and the portion of the Orange Book that lists Univasc as being covered by the ¡¬450 patent , stating : _NEWLINE_ Applicant herewith submits the Product Monograph for Univasc ( r ) ( Moexipril Hydrochloride Tablets ) wherein the tablets marketed by Schwarz Pharma ( as listed in the FDA Orange Book as per the teachings of United States Patent No . 4,743,450 ) include magnesium oxide ; unreacted but combined and functioning as a stabilizer ( see first page ) . The Examiner is referred to those pages . Full reconsideration is respectfully requested . _NEWLINE_ Joint Appendix ( `` J.A . '' ) at 12172 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Examiner rejected the claims a second time , but this time based on the combination of the ¡¬450 patent and the Gu article . The Examiner observed that it would have been obvious to combine the ¡¬450 patent 's teaching that ACE inhibitor drugs can be stabilized with an alkaline magnesium compound , with Gu 's teaching regarding stabilization of moexipril hydrochloride via wet granulation . In response , counsel again distinguished the prior art on the basis that no reaction was taught : _NEWLINE_ The Examiner alleges that Gu et al . renders obvious the process of making moexipril magnesium and that Gu discloses a process of making a moexipril alkaline salt by allegedly reacting moexipril hydrochloride with an alkaline stabilizing agent . Respectfully no such reaction is taught . The components are merely combined and any reaction is insignificant to the desired end result . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 12223 ( emphasis in original ) . Dr. Sherman 's counsel once more referred the Examiner to the Product Monograph for Univasc and the Orange Book and argued that Univasc includes magnesium oxide `` unreacted but combined . '' Id . at 12224 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Unconvinced , the Examiner issued a third and final rejection on obviousness grounds based on Gu and the ¡¬450 patent , finding that the neutralization taught by the cited references constituted a reaction . Dr. Sherman 's counsel appealed the final rejection to the PTO 's Board of Appeals , arguing that the cited references merely taught combining moexipril hydrochloride with an alkaline stabilizing agent . Id . at 12249 . Counsel again referred the Board to the Product Monograph for Univasc and the Orange Book and represented that Univasc , made according to the ¡¬450 patent , contained `` unreacted but combined '' *1358 moexipril hydrochloride and magnesium oxide . Id . at 12251 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ At the direction of Dr. Sherman , counsel also submitted the expert declaration of Dr. Michael Lipp , who reinforced the representations regarding the prior art . Specifically , Dr. Lipp explained that the function of a stabilizer is to inhibit or prevent reactions that would degrade the active ingredient , and that a stabilizer needs to be unreacted to perform this function . See id . at 12288 . According to Dr. Lipp , a person of skill in the art would therefore not expect a reaction to occur between the ACE inhibitor and the alkaline stabilizer disclosed in the ¡¬450 patent . Id . at 12289 . Dr. Lipp relied on Univasc to support his conclusion : _NEWLINE_ An additional example particularly relevant to the matter at hand is the UNVASC ( r ) [ sic ] moexipril hydrochloride formulation ... . The product monograph for the UNVASC [ sic ] moexipril hydrochloride formulation lists moexipril hydrochloride as being present in the final formulation in addition to magnesium oxide as an alkaline stabilizer , as per the teachings of the ¡¬450 patent which is listed on the FDA Orange Book for this formulation . As a result , in my opinion , a skilled formulator reading Harris et al . would not expect a reaction to occur between an alkaline or saccharide stabilizer and an ACE inhibitor drug in the formulations disclosed therein . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 12288-89 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In a subsequent telephonic interview , the Examiner and Dr. Sherman 's counsel agreed to incorporate into claim 1 a limitation requiring `` greater than 80 % '' conversion of the moexipril or moexipril acid addition salt to moexipril magnesium . As a result , the Examiner allowed the ¡¬556 patent claims on April 20 , 2004 . As reasons for allowance , the Examiner stated : _NEWLINE_ The primary reason for allowance is that the prior art does not disclose nor fairly suggest a process of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising moexipril magnesium , comprising the step of reacting moexipril or an acid addition salt thereof with an alkaline magnesium compound so as to convert greater than 80 % of the moexipril or moexipril acid addition salt to moexipril magnesium . Rather , the prior art teaches that only a portion of drug ( if any ) may be converted to the alkaline salt and that the stable product results entirely or primarily not from conversion to alkaline salts , but from stabilization of the moexipril hydrochloride by the presence of the alkaline stabilizing compound in the final product . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 12399 ( emphasis added ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D. District Court Proceedings _NEWLINE_ Apotex filed suit on April 20 , 2012 , accusing UCB of infringing claims 8-12 of the ¡¬556 patent by manufacturing and selling Univasc and Uniretic , as well as generic versions thereof . Prior to conducting a jury trial on infringement and invalidity , the district court held a three-day bench trial on claim construction and UCB 's equitable defenses . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court ruled that the ¡¬556 patent is unenforceable due to Dr. Sherman 's inequitable conduct before the PTO . Specifically , the district court found that Dr. Sherman was aware that Univasc was made according to his claimed process , concealed this knowledge from the PTO , and misrepresented the nature of Univasc and the prior art through his counsel 's arguments and Dr. Lipp 's declaration . The district court also found that Dr. Sherman withheld relevant prior art and submitted results of experiments that he never conducted . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1359 The district court relied on several pieces of evidence in finding that Dr. Sherman was aware that Univasc involved a reaction . For instance , Dr. Sherman conceded during trial that , before filing the ¡¬556 patent application , he had a `` strong suspicion '' and a `` belief '' that Univasc was made according to his claimed process . Also , on the same day the application was filed , Dr. Sherman conducted tests comparing Univasc to an Apotex moexipril product with no alkaline stabilizer . In his handwritten notes , Dr. Sherman concluded that the Apotex product was `` much less stable than the magnesium salt , '' implying at least a suspicion that Univasc consisted of moexipril magnesium . About a month later , Dr. Sherman 's suspicion was confirmed by two Apotex scientists who produced a detailed mass spectrometry report on Univasc and concluded that moexipril in Univasc is `` mainly present '' as moexipril magnesium . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court also found that Dr. Sherman was aware of , and involved in , all decisions regarding prosecution of the ¡¬556 patent application . The court noted that Dr. Sherman is highly familiar with patent prosecution and patent enforcement litigation . Although Dr. Sherman attempted to disclaim knowledge of the components of Univasc , the prior art , and the statements made to the PTO by his counsel , the district court did not find his testimony to be credible . The district court observed that Dr. Sherman selectively displayed at trial a lack of memory and responsibility that led the court to conclude he was not a credible witness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also found that Dr. Sherman made several misrepresentations to the PTO regarding the prior art . In particular , Dr. Sherman misrepresented the nature of Univasc and the ¡¬450 patent by asserting that the moexipril hydrochloride in Univasc was not reacted but merely combined with an alkaline magnesium compound . The district court also found that Dr. Sherman , in the specification and through Dr. Lipp 's declaration , mischaracterized the Gu article by asserting that only a minor portion of the drug , if any , is converted to moexipril magnesium . Lastly , the district court found that Dr. Sherman lied in the ¡¬556 patent application by including certain examples of experiments that were never conducted . The court noted that each example is written in the past tense as if it had occurred , but Dr. Sherman admitted at trial that the experiments were made up in his head . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court further concluded that Dr. Lipp was only hired to add legitimacy to Dr. Sherman 's misrepresentations . The court found that Dr. Sherman failed to inform Dr. Lipp of the true facts about Univasc and shielded him from the truth , which resulted in a declaration that Dr. Sherman knowingly submitted to the PTO to perpetuate his mischaracterizations of the prior art . Dr. Lipp testified that he was specifically asked to limit his discussions to only the documents provided by Apotex , which did not include any information regarding the tests conducted on Univasc or Dr. Sherman 's knowledge of the product . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In addition to the misrepresentations , the district court found that Dr. Sherman withheld relevant prior art from the PTO . Specifically , PCT Application No . WO 99/62560 , titled `` Stabilization of Quinapril Using Magnesium Oxide '' ( `` the ¡¬560 PCT '' ) , was cited by the PTO in a 2003 office action for U.S . Application No . 10/060,191 ( `` the ¡¬191 application '' ) , of which Dr. Sherman is also an inventor . The ¡¬560 PCT relates to a method for stabilizing an ACE inhibitor drug , like quinapril , using magnesium oxide , and the Examiner interpreted this reference as disclosing a reaction between a hydrochloride *1360 salt and an alkaline base . Given the similarities between the ¡¬191 application and the ¡¬556 patent and Dr. Sherman 's experience , the district court found that Dr. Sherman would have known about the ¡¬560 PCT and understood its relevance to the prosecution of the ¡¬556 patent . The ¡¬560 PCT , however , was never disclosed to the Examiner handling the prosecution of the ¡¬556 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that the foregoing combined misrepresentations and withholding of prior art were material to the prosecution of the ¡¬556 patent application . Based on the Examiner 's reasons for allowance , the district court concluded that the Examiner adopted Dr. Sherman 's repeated misrepresentations verbatim and would not have allowed the claims had he been aware that Univasc contained moexipril magnesium . The district court also found the ¡¬560 PCT 's disclosure of a reaction between a hydrochloride salt and an alkaline base to be material because of the similarities between the ¡¬191 application and the ¡¬556 patent , and the fact that the ¡¬560 PCT discloses the four basic steps of wet granulation recited in claim 8 of the ¡¬556 patent . Although the district court found that the falsification of examples in the ¡¬556 patent was alone not sufficiently material , it nonetheless added to the materiality determination when viewed in conjunction with other misrepresentations and omissions . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the alternative , the district court found that a finding of but-for materiality was not necessary because Dr. Sherman engaged in egregious misconduct during prosecution of the ¡¬556 patent application . In addition to the various misrepresentations made by Dr. Sherman , the district court observed that Dr. Sherman abused the patent system by targeting a competitor 's existing and widely available product and seeking to obtain a patent on it through lies and deception for the purpose of suing that competitor . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Regarding intent , the district court found that the single most reasonable inference that could be drawn from the evidence was that Dr. Sherman intended to deceive the PTO . The court based its determination on Dr. Sherman 's overall pattern of misconduct and his poor credibility at trial . The district court concluded that Dr. Sherman intentionally violated his duty of candor not only by making repeated misrepresentations to the PTO during prosecution of the ¡¬ 556 patent , but also by including experiment results in the specification as if the experiments had actually been conducted , and by purposely shielding an expert from relevant information to obtain a declaration that misinformed and led the Examiner to finally allow the claims . The court also found that Dr. Sherman 's demeanor and evasive testimony at trial were evidence of his intent to deceive the PTO . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court therefore held the ¡¬556 patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct . Additionally , the court ruled in favor of UCB on its judicial estoppel and laches equitable defenses , indefiniteness and claim construction . The court entered final judgment against Apotex on September 19 , 2013 . The jury trial on infringement and invalidity was never held . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex filed a timely appeal . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ We affirm the district court 's holding that the ¡¬556 patent is unenforceable due to Dr. Sherman 's inequitable conduct . The district court 's findings regarding materiality and intent are not clearly erroneous , and its ultimate determination that Dr. Sherman breached his duty of candor , *1361 good faith , and honesty before the PTO was not an abuse of discretion.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A. Materiality _NEWLINE_ Clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that Dr. Sherman engaged in material misconduct . First , Dr. Sherman was actively involved in the prosecution of the ¡¬556 patent and instigated the representations made on his behalf by his counsel and Dr. Lipp . The ¡¬556 patent 's specification , written by Dr. Sherman , omits important details regarding the prior art that were determined to have been known to him . Record evidence shows that Dr. Sherman 's counsel was in constant communication with him during prosecution and kept him appraised of actions taken by the PTO and arguments made in response , including the representation that the prior art did not involve a reaction . Indeed , Dr. Sherman directly instructed his counsel to continue pressing those arguments and to bolster them through an expert declaration . We see no reason to disturb the district court 's finding that Dr. Sherman 's attempt to disclaim knowledge and responsibility at trial was not credible.3 The district court 's finding that Dr. Sherman is responsible for the alleged misconduct is not clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , Dr. Sherman made affirmative misrepresentations of material facts . Apotex 's internal tests showed that moexipril in Univasc is `` mainly present '' as moexipril magnesium . Although the tests were conducted in 2001 , before the PTO issued its first rejection of the ¡¬556 patent claims , Dr. Sherman repeatedly asserted before the PTO that the process of the ¡¬450 patent used to manufacture Univasc did not involve a reaction that would produce moexipril magnesium . Years after issuance of the patent , as part of its infringement case , Apotex confirmed through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) testing that Univasc indeed contains more than 80 % moexipril magnesium . Dr. Sherman 's assertions during prosecution regarding the absence of moexipril magnesium in Univasc were false . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Third , Dr. Sherman 's misconduct was `` but-for material '' to the issuance of the ¡¬556 patent . The Examiner 's rejections were based on the very same prior art that is the subject of Dr. Sherman 's misrepresentations . The Examiner allowed the claims only after being convinced that the prior art moexipril tablets were stable not from conversion to moexipril magnesium ( i.e. , a reaction ) , but because the alkaline stabilizer was combined and remained present in the final product without reacting with the moexipril . See J.A . at 12399 . Dr. Lipp 's declaration was instrumental in this regard . The Examiner 's erroneous belief regarding the prior art corresponds precisely with Dr. Sherman 's repeated misrepresentations made through his counsel and the hired expert . We conclude that the PTO would not have allowed the ¡¬556 patent but for Dr. Sherman 's misconduct . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To be clear , we agree with Apotex that Dr. Sherman had no duty to disclose his own suspicions or beliefs regarding the prior art.4 There is nothing wrong with advocating , in good faith , a reasonable interpretation of the teachings of the prior *1362 art.5 The misconduct at issue , however , goes beyond failing to disclose a personal belief or alternative interpretations of the prior art ; here , Dr. Sherman affirmatively and knowingly misrepresented material facts regarding the prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because we affirm the district court 's finding that the misrepresentations regarding the prior art were but-for material , we need not decide whether Dr. Sherman 's conduct rises to the level of egregious misconduct such that materiality could have been presumed.6 We also need not address the materiality of Dr. Sherman 's failure to disclose the ¡¬560 PCT or his falsification of examples in the ¡¬556 patent . We note , however , that Dr. Sherman 's actions , at a minimum , come close to the type of affirmative misconduct that in Therasense we held could justify finding inequitable conduct without showing but-for materiality . We find particularly significant and inexcusable the fact that Dr. Sherman arranged for the preparation and submission of an expert declaration containing false statements instrumental to issuance of the patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . Intent _NEWLINE_ We affirm the district court 's finding that clear and convincing evidence establishes Dr. Sherman 's intent to deceive the PTO . The district court did not clearly err in finding that Dr. Sherman knew , or at least had a strong suspicion , that he was seeking to patent the very same process used to obtain an already existing and widely available drug . As of the filing of the ¡¬556 patent application , Dr. Sherman was aware that some of the assertions he made in the specification regarding the prior art were at least misleadingly incomplete , if not plainly inaccurate . Additionally , Dr. Sherman admitted that he never performed the experiments described in the ¡¬556 patent , and yet he drafted the examples in the specification entirely in past-tense language . See ¡¬556 patent col. 5 l. 1-col. 6 l. 16 . Dr. Sherman was also aware that additional misrepresentations were made on his behalf to the PTO , and directed his counsel to bolster those misrepresentations by procuring and submitting the declaration of an expert who was deliberately shielded from the truth . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex argues that merely advocating a particular interpretation of the prior art can not support an inference of deceptive intent . But Dr. Sherman 's statements were not mere advocacy for a preferred interpretation ; his statements were factual in nature and contrary to the true information he had in his possession . It is immaterial that , at that time , Dr. Sherman had no direct knowledge of UCB 's actual manufacturing process or had determined the exact amount of moexipril magnesium present in Univasc . He knew enough to recognize that he was crossing the line from legitimate advocacy to genuine misrepresentation of material facts . In the aggregate , Dr. Sherman 's conduct evidences a pattern of lack of candor . We agree with the district court that deceptive intent is the single most reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence.7 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1363 CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding the ¡¬556 patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct . In view of this , we need not reach the district court 's rulings on claim construction , indefiniteness , laches and judicial estoppel .

Oral argument was heard on July 12 , 2001 . Because we hold that the patentee raised a genuine issue as to whether its reduction to practice preceded the publication of the article , we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ In 1991 , Loral sued numerous Japanese electronics manufacturers , and their U.S. distributors , for infringement of claim 1 of its United States Patent No . 3,931,674 ( the ¡¬674 patent ) , which claims a process for manufacturing a charge-coupled device ( `` CCD '' ) . A CCD is an important component in electronic cameras that produces an electrical signal representing the image that is focused upon it . This signal can then be processed and displayed on a video monitor . In August 1995 , the district court severed and stayed Loral 's claims against the non-manufacturing defendants , leaving six manufacturing defendants : Sony , Sanyo , Toshiba , Hitachi , NEC , and OKI . The court ordered separate trials for each . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Sony was the first and only defendant to go to trial . Over the course of five weeks in 1996 , Loral and Sony tried the issues of validity and infringement to a jury . On February 14 , 1996 , the jury returned a verdict finding that Sony did not prove invalidity of the asserted claims , and that Loral had proven infringement under the doctrine of equivalents . Sony then moved for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) or , alternatively , for a new trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court granted Sony 's motion for JMOL , holding that no reasonable jury could find that Sony infringed . See Loral Fairchild Corp. v. Victor Co. of Japan , 931 F.Supp . 1014 ( E.D.N.Y.1996 ) ( Loral II ) . One basis for the court 's decision was that Sony 's accused process could not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because it had been disclosed in a journal article authored by Dr. Darrel Erb ( `` the Erb reference '' ) and published on December 3 , 1973 , prior to the February 8 , 1974 filing date of the application that issued as the *1361 ¡¬674 patent . Id . at 1030 ( citing Wilson Sporting Goods Co. v. David Geoffrey & Assoc. , 904 F.2d 677 , 683-85 , 14 USPQ2d 1942 , 1948-49 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ( patentee may not assert a range of equivalents for infringement purposes that includes the prior art ) ) . Although the jury had returned a special verdict form indicating that it found that the Erb reference did not qualify as prior art against the ¡¬674 patent , the district court concluded that no reasonable jury could have done so . Loral II , 931 F.Supp . at 1031 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , we affirmed the grant of JMOL , but solely on the ground that Loral 's allegations of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents were barred by prosecution history estoppel ; our decision did not address whether the Erb reference is prior art with respect to the ¡¬674 patent . Loral Fairchild Corp. v. Sony Corp. , 181 F.3d 1313 , 1316 n. 3 , 50 USPQ2d 1865 , 1876 n. 3 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ( Loral III ) . In response , Loral maintained its actions against only those of the remaining manufacturing defendants that it believed were literally infringing the ¡¬674 patent-Toshiba and NEC . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On April 10 , 2000 , Toshiba and NEC each moved for summary judgment that claim 1 is invalid as obvious in view of the Erb reference , which was asserted to be prior art under ¡± 102 ( a ) . The district court held a two-day hearing on the motions . The court then issued a final judgment and an unpublished decision granting the motions , holding that there was no genuine issue as to the status of the Erb reference as prior art , and that claim 1 was obvious in light of it . Loral Fairchild Corp. v. Victor Co. of Japan , Nos . 92-0128 & 91-5056 ( E.D.N.Y . June 21 , 2000 ) ( Toshiba I ) . Loral filed a timely notice of appeal , and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ Summary judgment is proper only when no `` reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party . '' Anderson v. Liberty Lobby , Inc. , 477 U.S. 242 , 255 , 106 S.Ct . 2505 , 2510 , 91 L.Ed.2d 202 ( 1986 ) . In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists , the trial court must assume that the evidence presented by the non-movant is credible and draw all justifiable inferences therefrom in the non-movant 's favor . Id . at 255 , 106 S.Ct . at 2513 . Because of the statutory presumption of patent validity , 35 U.S.C . ¡± 282 , at trial Toshiba and NEC would bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the Erb reference was published prior to Loral 's reduction to practice . Mahurkar v. C.R . Bard , Inc. , 79 F.3d 1572 , 1578 , 38 USPQ2d 1288 , 1291 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ( `` Bard must persuade the trier of fact by clear and convincing evidence that the Cook catalog was published prior to Dr. Mahurkar 's invention date. '' ) . Of course , Loral would bear a burden of production to present evidence of its asserted actual reduction to practice prior to the filing date of its patent application . Id . at 1576-77 , 79 F.3d 1572 , 38 USPQ2d at 1290 ( `` Had Dr. Mahurkar not come forward with evidence of an earlier date of invention , the Cook catalog would have been anticipatory prior art under section 102 ( a ) because Dr. Mahurkar 's invention date would have been the filing date of his patent. '' ) . Because Loral does not argue for conception plus diligence to establish a date of invention prior to the publication date of the Erb article , but only an actual reduction to practice , we address only Loral 's actual reduction to practice of the invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The proceedings in the Sony litigation are relevant to this appeal only because Toshiba and NEC relied exclusively upon evidence submitted during the Sony *1362 trial in support of their motions for summary judgment . Loral , however , relied upon both evidence submitted during the Sony trial and new evidence to oppose the motions . Critically , the district court applied neither issue preclusion nor collateral estoppel against Loral when ruling on the motions by Toshiba and NEC . Rather , the district court permissibly regarded its earlier findings on the prior art status of the Erb reference merely as a non-preclusive starting point , allowing the parties here both to submit new evidence and rely upon evidence submitted during the Sony trial . Toshiba I , slip op . at 9 . The trial court 's earlier findings are not law of the case and we do not understand the court to have so treated them when it ruled upon both the old and the new evidence . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In opposition to Toshiba 's and NEC 's motions for summary judgment , Loral argued both that the Erb reference does not render the asserted claim obvious and that it does not constitute prior art . Loral submitted evidence that the inventor named in the ¡¬674 patent , Dr. Gilbert Amelio , conceived of the invention and actually reduced it to practice prior to the publication of the Erb reference . Dr. Amelio 's conception of the invention prior to the publication of the Erb reference is not disputed . Thus , the critical question in this appeal is whether the evidence submitted by Loral was sufficient to raise a genuine issue as to whether Dr. Amelio 's actual reduction to practice occurred prior to the publication of the Erb reference . If so , then the grant of summary judgment must be reversed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . The Evidence Relied Upon By Loral In Opposition to Summary Judgment _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . The Amelio Affidavit _NEWLINE_ Loral referred the district court to several items of evidence tending to indicate that the invention was actually reduced to practice prior to December 3 , 1973 . The only item not previously considered by the trial court during the Sony trial was an affidavit executed on April 14 , 2000 , by Dr. Amelio ( `` the Amelio affidavit '' ) in which he states that the invention was reduced to practice shortly after September 14 , 1973 , but no later than mid-October 1973-when Loral `` had initial production-quality devices . '' Because Dr. Amelio was employed by one of Loral 's competitors during the Sony litigation , he was not available to testify at that time . He subsequently ended that employment , and was retained by Loral for the purpose of submitting an affidavit in this case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court granted the motions for summary judgment , holding that `` claim 1 of the ¡¬674 patent is obvious in light of the Erb reference , and therefore invalid . '' Toshiba I , slip op . at 12 . In its opinion , the district court concluded that `` Dr. Amelio claims no more than that he was 'working on reducing to practice ' from June 1973 'through ' mid-March 1974 . '' Id . at 11 . The Amelio affidavit , however , undermines that conclusion . In the affidavit , Dr. Amelio asserts a reduction to practice in September 1973 , albeit with commercialization efforts continuing through mid-March 1974 , stating ( emphasis added ) : _NEWLINE_ I and those at Fairchild under my direction were diligently working on reducing to practice and commercializing the ¡¬674 Process throughout the period of time from no later than June 1973 through the introduction of the commercial CCD110 product in mid-March 1974 . `` No later than September 14 , 1973 , Fairchild produced working devices and established that the ¡¬674 Process would work for its intended purpose . '' _NEWLINE_ The underlined sentence was not addressed in the district court 's opinion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Once the invention has been shown to work for its intended purpose , reduction *1363 to practice is complete . Mahurkar , 79 F.3d at 1578 , 38 USPQ2d at 1291 . Further efforts to commercialize the invention are simply not relevant to determining whether a reference qualifies as prior art against the patented invention . The district court concluded that Loral 's evidence was insufficient to avoid summary judgment because the Amelio affidavit contains `` no statement asserting that he actually fabricated , and demonstrated by testing , the device claimed in the ¡¬674 patent before March 1974 . '' Toshiba I , slip op . at 11 . This conclusion is also not supported by the Amelio affidavit . The ¡¬674 patent claims a process for producing CCDs , and in his affidavit Dr. Amelio states that he and others at Loral had optimized the claimed process by making iterative changes to its parameters , and then evaluating each change by examining the CCDs produced . He further states that `` by mid-October 1973 , we had initial production-quality devices , '' i.e. , the claimed process had been demonstrated to work for its intended purpose . Thus , in the Amelio affidavit the inventor alleged a reduction to practice prior to publication of the Erb reference . The court may not assess the credibility of testimony when granting summary judgment ; thus to the extent that the district court assessed credibility in reaching its conclusions regarding the Amelio affidavit , those conclusions were improper . Thus , because the Amelio affidavit asserts reduction to practice prior to publication of the Erb reference , the issue then becomes whether Loral submitted independent evidence sufficient to corroborate this assertion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B. Loral 's Evidence to Corroborate the Amelio Affidavit _NEWLINE_ `` In order to establish an actual reduction to practice , an inventor 's testimony must be corroborated by independent evidence . '' Cooper v. Goldfarb , 154 F.3d 1321 , 1330 , 47 USPQ2d 1896 , 1903 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) . The sufficiency of such corroborating evidence is evaluated under a `` rule of reason , '' considering all of the pertinent evidence . Id . ( `` The rule requires an evaluation of all pertinent evidence when determining the credibility of an inventor 's testimony ... . In order to corroborate a reduction to practice , it is not necessary to produce an actual over-the-shoulder observer . Rather , sufficient circumstantial evidence of an independent nature can satisfy the corroboration requirement. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To corroborate the Amelio affidavit , Loral relied , inter alia , upon evidence that had been presented during the Sony trial , including the trial testimony of one of Dr. Amelio 's co-workers at Loral , Dr. David Wen . Dr. Wen had testified that Loral received custom-fabricated lithographic masks necessary for practicing the invention on or about September 14 , 1973 , the date stamped on the masks . Dr. Wen further testified that `` as soon as we receive the masks , which are the stencils , we would actually start manufacturing the device . '' Loral also submitted copies of the actual masks , which had been submitted into evidence during the Sony trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Other than that of Dr. Wen , Loral offered no testimony to corroborate Dr. Amelio 's alleged reduction to practice . Loral did , however , refer the court to other evidence that had been submitted during the Sony trial . In November 1973 , Loral submitted to the United States Air Force a responsive proposal to provide CCDs produced using the claimed process . In the proposal , Loral stated that the claimed process `` is already showing reliable performance and high yield . '' In his declaration , Amelio stated that he `` was ultimately responsible for preparation of the Proposal and personally participated in its preparation . '' To bolster the credibility of the statement , however , Loral points *1364 out that the Air Force Proposal was prepared under a general statutory obligation of truthfulness . See 18 U.S.C . ¡± 1001 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Loral II , the district court afforded the lithographic masks little relevance : `` At best , as recognized by [ Loral 's ] Dr. Wen , the mask overlay set demonstrates [ Loral ] researchers had performed some design work . The overlays do not show that Dr. Amelio had run the process claimed in the ¡¬ 674 patent and knew it would work for its intended purpose . '' Loral II , 931 F.Supp . at 1028 . While we agree that , by themselves , the masks do not prove when the reduction to practice occurred , they were necessary for a reduction to practice and Dr. Wen testified that Loral possessed the masks beginning on or about September 14 , 1973 . Further , Dr. Wen testified that the masks support that Loral employees `` had completed the design of the device and were about to begin manufacturing . '' This is entirely consistent with , and corroborates , the timing of the events constituting the reduction to practice alleged in the Amelio affidavit . It also gives rise to a reasonable inference , which must be made in favor of non-movant Loral , that on or about September 14 , 1973 , Loral began production efforts using the claimed process , with subsequent reduction to practice once process performance had been demonstrated . The Air Force Proposal indicates that process performance was established by November 1973 , prior to publication of the Erb reference in December . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Cooper , 154 F.3d at 1330 , 47 USPQ2d at 1903 , we held that reduction to practice had been proven by the inventor 's testimony corroborated by testimony of his co-workers that he had told them of his reduction to practice , and that they had seen him obtain materials of the type necessary to practice the invention . We so held even though `` no direct evidence supported Goldfarb 's testimony that he measured fibril length and observed tissue ingrowth . '' Id . ( `` We agree with the Board that circumstantial evidence provided sufficient corroboration . `` ) ; see also Lacotte v. Thomas , 758 F.2d 611 , 613 , 225 USPQ 633 , 634 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( affirming finding of reduction to practice , stating `` [ t ] he testimony of Thomas , the inventor , and the written evidence of his reduction to practice in his notebook , are corroborated by independent circumstantial evidence of his withdrawal of supplies to practice the invention , as well as independent corroborating testimony of his associate , Lee. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , Dr. Amelio 's alleged reduction to practice , to be sure , is not corroborated by documentary evidence of test results confirming process performance . It is , however , corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Wen , the delivery date of the masks necessary to practice the invention , and the Air Force Proposal . As in both Cooper and Lacotte , Loral has presented corroborating testimony by a co-worker of the inventor , and has demonstrated that material necessary to practice the invention was obtained prior to the alleged reduction to practice . And more , the district court 's insistence upon `` documentary evidence '' to corroborate test results of Dr. Amelio 's claimed reduction to practice was erroneous as a matter of law . Toshiba I , slip op . at 10 ( `` [ T ] o meet the corroboration requirement , Loral , at a minimum , would need to produce documentary evidence , such as signed laboratory notebooks or test results or activities to show priority . '' ( emphasis added ) ) . Under the `` rule of reason , '' the inventor 's testimony must be sufficiently corroborated by independent evidence , but not necessarily documentary evidence . Rather , `` [ t ] he rule requires an evaluation of all pertinent evidence when determining the credibility of an inventor 's testimony . '' *1365 Cooper , 154 F.3d at 1330 , 47 USPQ2d at 1903 ( emphasis added ) . Furthermore , it is not surprising that Loral has been unable to submit documents showing production test results , considering that the events at issue occurred almost 30 years ago . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ To avoid summary judgment , Loral needed only to show that Dr. Amelio asserted reduction to practice prior to the publication of the Erb article , and to provide the corroborating evidence required under this court 's precedent.1 It did so . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ In view of the evidence submitted by Loral , the grant of summary judgment was improper because that evidence raised a genuine issue as to whether those at Loral reduced the claimed invention to practice prior to the publication of the Erb article . Given that , we have no occasion to consider Loral 's other arguments on appeal , including the correctness of the district court 's conclusion that the claimed invention is obvious in view of the Erb reference . We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment , and remand for further proceedings . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED AND REMANDED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ PAULINE NEWMAN , Circuit Judge , concurring in the judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I agree that it is appropriate to reverse the grant of summary judgment . I write separately lest the majority 's opinion be taken as new law with respect to the requirements for antedating a publication that would otherwise be a reference under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Antedating a Reference _NEWLINE_ The court 's opinion states that a reference can be antedated only by prior reduction to practice , stating : `` Of course , Loral would bear the burden of production to present evidence of its asserted actual reduction to practice prior to the filing date of its patent application . '' The opinion also states that `` at trial Toshiba and NEC would bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the Erb reference was published prior to Loral 's reduction to practice . '' However , the opinion correctly quotes precedent that the inventor `` had to 'come forward with evidence of an earlier date of invention . ' `` The date of invention is the date of conception , not the date of reduction to practice . Pfaff v. Wells Electronics , Inc. , 525 U.S. 55 , 60 , 119 S.Ct . 304 , 142 L.Ed.2d 261 , 48 USPQ2d 1641 , 1644 ( 1998 ) ( `` The primary meaning of the word 'invention ' in the Patent Act unquestionably refers to the inventor 's conception rather than to a physical embodiment of that idea . `` ) ; Id. , at 66 , 119 S.Ct . 304 , 142 L.Ed.2d 261 , 48 USPQ2d at 1646 ( `` petitioner 's argument *1366 ... does not persuade us that it is necessary to engraft a reduction to practice element into the meaning of the term 'invention ' as used in ¡± 102 ( b ) '' ) ; Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Laboratories , Inc. , 40 F.3d 1223 , 1227-28 , 32 USPQ2d 1915 , 1919 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) ( `` Conception is the touchstone of inventorship , the completion of the mental part of invention . '' ) _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Loral had to show that before the publication date of the Erb article the inventor , Dr. Amelio , had either a reduction to practice , or conception of the invention plus diligence to actual or constructive reduction to practice . This is well-established law , in the Patent Office as in the courts : _NEWLINE_ 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.131 ( b ) The showing of facts shall be such , in character and weight , as to establish reduction to practice prior to the effective date of the reference , or conception of the invention prior to the effective date of the reference coupled with due diligence from prior to said date to a subsequent reduction to practice or to the filing of the application ... . _NEWLINE_ The defendants readily concede that Dr. Amelio had conceived the patented invention before the publication date of the reference . Also , the evidence of activity constituting reduction to practice was not disputed by the defendants ; their arguments were directed solely to the issues of corroboration and the position that the Erb date to be overcome was not the date of the article 's publication but the date when the underlying work was conceived and done . The interest of clarity of precedent , and efficiency on remand , require a more positive statement than has been made by my colleagues on this panel . Further , with the correction of the ruling that the work underlying the Erb article sets the date that must be antedated by Loral 's reduction to practice , there is no longer a disputed issue of fact that requires resolution on remand . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Corroboration _NEWLINE_ The court sets requirements of corroboration of the inventor 's testimony based on the law governing Patent Office interference practice , citing Cooper v. Goldfarb , 154 F.3d 1321 , 47 USPQ2d 1896 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) and Lacotte v. Thomas , 758 F.2d 611 , 225 USPQ 633 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) , both PTO interferences , whose detailed and highly formalistic corroboration of the inventor 's work is traditionally required in order to establish priority between competing inventors . That is not at issue here . Here the issue is solely a matter of antedating a publication , where the probative value of the inventor 's testimony is as for any factual question : the weight and value of the evidence is determined , with due consideration to the issue to be decided as well as any contrary evidence and the burden of proof . The evidentiary standard for antedating a reference is not the same as the PTO requirement for establishing priority in an interference contest . Inventors ' affidavits have always been admissible to antedate a reference . The regulations are explicit that evidence to antedate a reference may be provided by the inventor : _NEWLINE_ 37 C.F.R . ¡± 1.131 ( a ) ( 1 ) When any claim of an application or a patent under reexamination is rejected [ on reference to ] a printed publication , the inventor of the subject matter of the rejected claim ... may submit an appropriate oath or declaration to overcome the patent or publication . The oath or declaration must include facts showing a completion of the invention in this country ... before the date of the printed publication . _NEWLINE_ Antedating a reference is a common occurrence , governed by a stable and non-controversial jurisprudence . Let us not add uncertainties to this law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1367 The 102 ( g ) Issue _NEWLINE_ The district court had required that Loral show an actual reduction to practice before the date of the underlying work of the Erb article , invoking ¡± 102 ( g ) . See Loral Fairchild Corp. v. Victor Co. of Japan , No . 92-0128 ( E.D.N.Y. , June 21 , 2000 ) slip op . at 8 ( `` This court , comparing the Erb work with the invention of the ¡¬674 patent , previously determined that the Erb work was prior art to the ¡¬674 patent . `` ) ; id . ( `` Beyond its finding of a lack of diligence , however , this court also determined that Messrs. Erb and Su conceived the invention before Dr. Amelio , the inventor of the ¡¬674 patent . Thus , the Erb/Su conception date predated publication of their article by more than a year . `` ) ; id . at 10 ( `` Loral has not proffered any new evidence to overcome this court 's finding , based on earlier reduction to practice , that the Erb work was prior art under 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 102 ( a ) and 102 ( g ) . '' ) See also Loral Fairchild Corp. v. Victor Co. of Japan , 931 F.Supp . 1014 , 1032 ( E.D.N.Y.1996 ) ( `` [ T ] he record shows that Drs . Erb and Su actually reduced their process to practice at the end of September 1973 ... . Because Dr. Amelio can not show reasonable diligence from before this date to his filing date , the Erb/Su work stands as prior art. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The record reflects a kind of inter partes interference proceeding with the authors of the Erb paper , who testified as to their work and when it was done . There is a specific statutory authorization for conducting an interference in the district court , but this does not apply when there is not an adverse claimant to a patent . Reliance on either the date of the Erb publication or the date of the work underlying the publication is mentioned in an ambiguous Footnote 1 in this court 's opinion , which flags the issue but does not lay it to rest . Much mischief can flow if we open this door whereby a publication is effective as a reference as of the date the authors did the underlying work . It is our obligation , as the reviewing court , to act to assure clarity in the law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 266 F.3d 1358 , 60 U.S.P.Q.2d 1361 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While Loral also argues that the research activities of Dr. Erb which culminated in the Erb reference do not qualify as prior art under ¡± 102 ( g ) , it is not necessary for us to address this issue because the district court held only that the asserted claim was `` obvious in light of the Erb reference . '' Toshiba I , slip op . at 12 . Throughout the trial court 's JMOL decision in the Sony case , the phrase `` the Erb reference '' is used to refer exclusively to the Erb publication , not the underlying research activities . See Loral II , 931 F.Supp . at 1027-31 . In that same opinion , the phrase `` the Erb work '' is used to refer exclusively to the underlying research activities , and not the published article . Id . at 1031-34 . In the decision on review in the instant appeal , the district court stated that `` [ t ] his court previously found that the Erb reference , and the work underlying that article , antedates the ¡¬674 patent . '' Toshiba I , slip op . at 6 ( emphasis added ) . Thus , it seems clear that the court held claim 1 invalid solely on the basis of the Erb article , applying it as prior art under ¡± 102 ( a ) . Further , the issue of validity in view of the underlying research efforts by Dr. Erb , which might qualify as prior art under ¡± 102 ( g ) , is nowhere addressed in the motions for , or opposition to , summary judgment submitted by the parties to the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

We affirm the appealed portions of the judgment in all respects . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . Background _NEWLINE_ Polaroid sued Kodak on April 26 , 1976 for infringement , 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( a ) , and for actively inducing infringement , 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( b ) , of ten Polaroid patents . The complaint requested issuance of temporary and permanent injunctions , treble damages , costs , and attorney fees . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Over the next five years , the parties participated in pretrial conferences , filed numerous motions , and engaged in extensive discovery , accounting for more than one thousand entries in the district court 's certified docket.1 Between October 5 , 1981 and February 26 , 1982 , the district court conducted seventy-five days of trial . On October 11 , 1985 the district court issued its judgment : ( 1 ) holding that Kodak had failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding of invalidity of the asserted claims of seven patents ; 2 ( 2 ) finding certain claims infringed ; ( 3 ) holding claims of five patents invalid , but if valid , infringed ; and ( 4 ) granting a permanent injunction that would become effective on January 9 , 1986.3 On November 4 , 1985 , Kodak moved this court , pursuant to Fed.R.App.P . 8 ( a ) , to stay the injunction , pending completion of its appeal . Following briefing and oral argument on January 6 , 1986 , this court denied that motion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak appeals from certain portions of the judgment : that it had failed to carry its burden respecting validity of seven patents ; 4 and from the judgment that it had infringed certain claims ; 5 and that Patent No . 3,753,392 is not unenforceable . Polaroid has not cross-appealed the judgment that claims of five of its patents are invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . The District Court 's Memorandum Decision _NEWLINE_ With her judgment , the trial judge issued a comprehensive , 122-page Memorandum Decision , in which she exhaustively articulated the parties ' contentions , including each of Kodak 's myriad defenses . Incorporating her fact findings and legal conclusions , she delineated the evidence and testimony introduced at trial and noted her credibility determinations . The Memorandum Decision reflects the district court 's grasp of the involved technology and a correct application of the patent law to the facts found in what was at the trial stage a more complex case than even that presented on this appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Memorandum Decision of the trial judge makes it unnecessary to set forth here the relationships and events involving the parties or the developmental history of the technology , all of which the reader of this opinion may obtain from the reports of *1558 the Memorandum Decision cited here at the outset.6 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . Issue _NEWLINE_ Whether the district court committed reversible error in holding that Kodak had failed to carry its burden in respect of the validity of certain claims of seven Polaroid patents , or in finding some of those claims infringed by Kodak . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . Opinion _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Introduction _NEWLINE_ Though it is not yet ended ( see note 3 , supra ) , this massive and complex litigation already spans almost a decade . Polaroid 's amended complaint alleged infringement of forty-six claims of eleven patents . Kodak 's answer and counterclaims asserted multiple theories of invalidity , unenforceability , and non-infringment . This court granted motions for extended briefs and the appendix before us contains 18,000 pages of testimony , documents , and exhibits . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) Standard of Review _NEWLINE_ Kodak 's primary thrust on appeal , as we shall see , is aimed at the obvious/nonobvious issue . Though it is well settled that the ultimate conclusion on obviousness is just that , a legal conclusion , see Fromson v. Advance Offset Press , Inc. , 755 F.2d 1549 , 1555 , 225 USPQ 26 , 30 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) , that does not mean , as many of Kodak 's arguments would imply , that we may proceed on a paper record as though no trial had taken place.7 This court reviews judgments . Id . at 1556 , 225 USPQ at 31 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . Because we do not retry the case , Kodak must to prevail convince us that the judgment can not stand on the record created at trial , i.e. , that the judgment rests on such fundamental error as to compel reversal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The statutory question under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 is whether a claimed invention would have been obvious or nonobvious at the time it was made to one of ordinary skill in the art . That the question is `` legal '' does not mean that `` to a judge '' may be substituted for the statutory phrase `` to one of ordinary skill in the art '' . Thus the obvious/nonobvious question is not answerable by a judge on the sole basis of what he or she thinks `` ought '' to be patentable under ¡± 103 . The trial judge , eschewing all personal predilections , must decide on the totality of the evidence whether the accused infringer has carried its ¡± 282 burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence facts requiring a conclusion that one of ordinary skill would have found the claimed invention obvious at the time it was made . Id . at 1096 , 227 USPQ at 346 . The appellate judge , equally eschewing all personal predilections , must decide whether the trial judge 's controlling fact findings are clearly erroneous , or whether on the controlling facts correctly found the trial judge 's legal conclusion can or can not stand . Id . at 1096-97 , 227 USPQ at 346-47 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is commonplace that findings other than those of the trial judge might find some support in the record , or that reviewing judges if sitting at trial might have reached such other findings . It is therefore ineffective on appeal merely to present a scenario in which the trial judge could have gone appellant 's way , Anderson v. City of Bessemer City , N.C. , 470 U.S. 564 , 105 S.Ct . 1504 , 1512 , 84 L.Ed.2d 518 ( 1985 ) ( `` where there are two permissible views of the evidence , the fact finder 's choice between them can not be clearly erroneous '' ) . The rules governing appellate review thus require affirmance of judgments based on findings that were on the entire record made without the commission of reversible *1559 error . See American Original Corp. v. Jenkins Food Corp. , 774 F.2d 459 , 462 , 227 USPQ 299 , 300 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . Though seven patents are involved on this appeal , and we have carefully considered Kodak 's arguments on each one , we have been shown no error that might compel us on this record to reverse the judgment or any appealed portion thereof . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The burden of overcoming the district court 's factual findings is , as it should be , a heavy one . In reviewing a judgment based on those findings we do not perform as robed Examiners,8 nor do we repeat the role of the trial judge in finding our own facts . See Atlas Powder Co. v. E.I . Du Pont De Nemours & Co. , 750 F.2d 1569 , 1573 , 224 USPQ 409 , 411 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 2 ) Kodak 's Contentions _NEWLINE_ Kodak says the district court 's findings and conclusions `` are fatally flawed by systemic legal errors which permeate its approach to the issues of validity and infringement , '' supplying a list of six such errors : _NEWLINE_ ( 1 ) At the outset , the district court allowed preconceptions of Kodak 's culpability to influence its approach to the issues of validity and infringement ; _NEWLINE_ ( 2 ) The district court construed claims in a manner not consistent with the specifications and prosecution histories ; _NEWLINE_ ( 3 ) The district court , in considering non-obviousness of the claims , viewed the teachings of the prior art references in isolation , rather than together . _NEWLINE_ ( 4 ) The district court repeatedly evaluated the scope of the claims in light of the accused structure or process , and in light of post-issuance , self-serving statements of the inventors ; and _NEWLINE_ ( 5 ) The district court required anticipating art to teach what the patent in suit teaches . _NEWLINE_ ( 6 ) The district court made numerous `` erroneous '' findings of fact . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In proffering a total of eighteen arguments , Kodak variously applies items on the foregoing list to individual patents . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The assertion that the trial judge was influenced by preconceptions of Kodak 's culpability is unworthy of comment . That the remaining five assertions are without merit will be clear from our discussion of each of the seven patents involved in this appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 3 ) U.S. Patent No . 3,362,821 _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 , the only claim of the '821 patent asserted , reads : _NEWLINE_ 1 . In a process of forming color transfer images wherein a photosensitive element is exposed , an alkaline processing composition is applied to said photosensitive element to effect development thereof and imagewise diffusion transfer of a dye image-forming substance from said photosensitive element to an image-receiving layer in superposed relationship therewith to form a positive dye image , the improvement wherein said photosensitive element contains a layer of a nondiffusible polymeric acid positioned between the support and the innermost layer containing said dye image-forming substance , said layer containing said polymeric acid containing sufficient acid groups to effect a reduction in the pH of the surface of said image-receiving layer of at least 2 pH units , as compared with the initial pH of said alkaline precessing composition , prior to completion of the inhibition period . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court held that Kodak had not carried its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claim 1 is invalid , and that Polaroid had proved that Kodak infringed claim 1 when it made , used , and sold its PR-10 film . 228 USPQ at 312-13 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1560 Validity _NEWLINE_ First , Kodak says the district court misread claim 1 as including a limitation for `` timing '' drawn from the specification , and thus improperly distinguished the '821 patent over U.S. Patent No . 2,584,030 to Land ( '030 patent ) . It says the district court was misled by testimony respecting Polaroid 's attempts to perfect the timing of the pH drop which , `` however important [ those attempts ] may have been commercially , ha [ d ] little to do with what is claimed in '821 . '' Second , Kodak says a `` staining problem '' addressed in the '030 patent is the same problem addressed by the '821 acid layer , and its solution in '030 would have rendered claim 1 of '821 obvious . Third , Kodak asserts that Polaroid mischaracterized the '030 patent before the Examiner . And fourth , Kodak says the district court improperly relied on alleged `` advantages '' of the '821 acid layer to support patentability . Those arguments are without merit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the district court found , the '030 patent is drawn to processes for stabilizing sepia images . It is cited in the '821 patent among the references disclosed to the Examiner , and was fully discussed in Polaroid 's remarks during prosecution . Kodak 's burden in establishing invalidity is thus heavier : `` [ w ] hen no prior art other than that which was considered by the PTO examiner is relied on by the attacker , he has the added burden of overcoming the deference that is due to a qualified government agency presumed to have done its job ... '' American Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , Inc. , 725 F.2d 1350 , 1359 , 220 USPQ 763 , 770 ( Fed.Cir . ) , cert . denied , 469 U.S. 821 , 105 S.Ct . 95 , 83 L.Ed.2d 41 , 224 USPQ 520 ( 1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( a ) `` Timing '' _NEWLINE_ The record does not support Kodak 's assertion that the district court read `` limitations from the specification as well as limitations from other claims '' into claim 1 . Kodak points to language in the Memorandum Decision discussing the invention of the '821 patent with respect to the specification 's disclosure of `` three different timing mechanisms '' . 228 USPQ at 311 . Nothing in that discussion , however , supports Kodak 's assertion that the district court introduced a `` timing '' limitation into claim 1 to distinguish over the '030 patent . The district court 's remarks were there directed to Kodak 's argument at trial that `` the purpose of the [ '821 ] acid layer is to neutralize the processing composition and thereby to prevent stain caused by oxidation of the developer . '' Id . In that context , the district court 's reference to the '821 specification was entirely proper . See ACS Hospital Systems , Inc. v. Montefiore Hospital , 732 F.2d 1572 , 1577 , 221 USPQ 929 , 932 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . Moreover , the district court 's ¡± 103 analysis dealt specifically with the '030 patent and neither contains nor relies on a `` timing '' limitation in claim 1 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( b ) `` Staining '' _NEWLINE_ Kodak 's assertion that the invention set forth in claim 1 is directed to `` staining problems '' disclosed in the '030 patent is no more persuasive here than it was at trial . The district court expressly credited testimony of Polaroid 's Dr. Land , and rejected Kodak 's contention at trial that color and sepia diffusion transfer processes pose identical problems : _NEWLINE_ To say , as did Dr. Trautweiler , that if one deletes the words `` color '' and `` dye '' from claim 1 , one gets the process described by the '030 patent does not take sufficient account of the essential differences between the processes for sepia and color . Color diffusion transfer requires more time than the simpler silver transfer of sepia , and color requires the removal of the alkali metal ions from the environment of the image entirely . Neither these unique requirements of color , nor the mechanisms disclosed in '821 for meeting them , are disclosed in '030 . _NEWLINE_ 228 USPQ at 311 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak simply ignores the district court 's credibility determination and the quoted findings , arguing on appeal as though its `` staining '' contentions had been established as fact , and saying the person of ordinary skill would have known from the '030 patent that Polaroid 's developers *1561 can cause staining problems . The argument must fail . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( c ) Mischaracterization _NEWLINE_ Nothing of record supports Kodak 's statement that , during prosecution , `` [ t ] he sole distinction over '030 was the attorney 's erroneous representation that '821 differed from '030 in the location of the acid layer ... '' The record clearly establishes that the opposite was true . In the specification , Polaroid disclosed that , like the '030 patent , the invention in the '821 patent : _NEWLINE_ proposes to effect a neutralization of at least part of the residual alkali by employing a soluble substance of acid reaction ... . There is a disclosure , however , in [ '030 ] of the use of a polymeric acid such as cellulose acetate hydrogen phthalate , as a component of image-receiving elements effective to obtain pH reduction in silver transfer processes . The instant invention may be distinguished therefrom , among other ways , by the use of dye developers , the use of dyeable polymers as the image layer , and by the relatively thicker polymeric acid layers as compared with the image layer . _NEWLINE_ Col. 14 , lines 2-17 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Though the Examiner initially rejected application claim 10 ( claim 1 ) under ¡± 103 , he did not do so in view of the '030 patent . That reference was cited only with respect to application claims 12 ( cancelled ) and 18 ( non-asserted claim 3 ) . In respect of the latter claim , the Examiner said `` the function of the polymeric acid layer in either element is discussed or is inherent in [ '030 ] . '' In response , Polaroid noted that the '030 patent was fully discussed in Polaroid 's copending application Serial No . 234,864 , also before the Examiner , which it incorporated by reference . Following Polaroid 's Remarks , the Examiner withdrew his rejection based on the '030 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We reject Kodak 's assertion that the Examiner applied the '030 patent only to claims `` in which acid layers are placed in both the image receiving and photosensitive elements . '' That attempt to redefine the prosecution history is unavailing , where , as here , the whole reference was fairly before the Examiner . Cf . Lear Siegler , Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp. , 733 F.2d 881 , 885-86 , n. 4 , 221 USPQ 1025 , 1029 , n. 4 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In sum , Kodak has fallen far short of convincing us that the district court clearly erred in finding that `` the '030 patent was unquestionably before the examiner , '' and that `` Dr. Land and his attorney did not in any way misrepresent its significance . '' 228 USPQ at 312 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( d ) Advantages _NEWLINE_ Kodak makes a general allegation that the district court improperly relied on `` alleged advantages '' of the acid layer of the '821 patent to support patentability , i.e. , `` luminosity '' , `` mordant for alkali '' , etc . That the court mentioned those advantages does not establish that it relied on them . The court 's thorough analysis renders Kodak 's allegation pure conjecture , a conjecture totally unsupported by any record reference that would indicate such reliance . The allegation deserves no further comment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Infringement _NEWLINE_ Kodak attacks the district court 's finding that it infringed claim 1 on two grounds , saying the district court erred in : ( a ) construing `` photosensitive element '' in claim 1 ; and ( b ) finding that the PR-10 film unit was `` comprised of the same layers '' as those in the '821 patent . Kodak 's arguments rest on its own claim construction . The district court rejected that proffered construction and we agree . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( a ) Photosensitive Element _NEWLINE_ The '821 specification discloses a `` photosensitive element '' comprising , in Figure 1 : a support layer ; a layer containing a non-diffusible acid-reacting reagent ; a `` spacer '' layer ; and layers containing dye developers and emulsions . The district court 's use of `` photosensitive element '' is fully consistent with that disclosure . 228 USPQ at 312 . Kodak 's citation of its expert 's testimony respecting the `` ordinary meaning '' of `` photosensitive element '' in no manner undermines the district court 's judgment . That testimony was heard and weighed at trial . Faced with `` conflicting definitions of 'photosensitive *1562 element ' `` , id. , the district court , having heard the witnesses , chose the definition she found in the specification . Kodak has shown no reason why this court should choose its definition over that chosen by the district court . Further , the district court correctly rejected Kodak 's argument based on later-issued Polaroid patents which allegedly used `` photosensitive element '' somewhat differently . That argument is irrelevant where , as here , the patentee 's definition is sufficiently plain from the disclosure of the patent in suit as a whole . Cf . Fromson v. Advance Offset Plate , Inc. , 720 F.2d 1565 , 1569 , 219 USPQ 1137 , 1140 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( b ) Same Layers _NEWLINE_ In attacking the district court 's correlation of layers in its PR-10 film unit with those disclosed in the '821 patent , Kodak says `` during processing [ manufacture ] , a PR-10 film unit contains a layer of fluid processing composition between the cover sheet element ( which contains the acid ) , and the IIR ( the photosensitive element ) . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak 's argument is thrice flawed . First , it assumes that Kodak 's definition of what is , and is not , the `` photosensitive element '' is controlling . That assumption , as above indicated , is ill-founded . Second , as the district court correctly observed , claim 1 is directed to a process involving `` a layer of nondiffusible polymeric acid '' positioned `` between the support and the innermost layer containing said dye image-forming substance . '' 228 USPQ at 312 . The term `` photosensitive element '' , as found by the district court , includes Kodak 's acid layer ( which Kodak coats on the `` cover sheet element '' before assembing the film unit ) , and thus necessarily embraces the layer of processing fluid . Third , as the district court correctly noted , apparatus distinctions not claimed are not controlling in determining infringement of process claims . Amstar Corp. v. Envirotech Corp. , 730 F.2d 1476 , 1482 , 221 USPQ 649 , 653 ( Fed.Cir . ) , cert . denied , 469 U.S. 924 , 105 S.Ct . 306 , 83 L.Ed.2d 240 ( 1984 ) . Nothing in Kodak 's arguments convinces us of clear error in the district court 's finding that , `` regardless of the manner of manufacture , '' the sequence of layers during practice of the claimed process invention `` is comprised of the same layers depicted in Figure 1 of the patent and has the same structure described in claim 1 . '' 228 USPQ at 312 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court 's finding of infringement is fully supported by the record . As the district court correctly discerned , the `` distinction '' argued by Kodak is one without a difference . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 4 ) U.S. Patent No . 3,245,789 _NEWLINE_ Independent claim 5 of the '789 patent , from which claims 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 depend , sets forth : _NEWLINE_ 5 . A process of forming a diffusion transfer image in color comprising the steps of exposing a photosensitive element including a support carrying a silver halide emulsion , applying to said exposed photosensitive element an aqueous alkaline solution and developing said exposed silver halide emulsion in the presence of a colored silver halide developing agent , said silver halide developing agent , upon oxidation , forming an oxidation product which is substantially more mobile and more diffusible in said aquous [ sic ] alkaline solution than is said silver halide developing agent , said oxidation product being colored and having a lower molecular weight than said silver halide developing agent , forming said more mobile oxidation product in developed areas of said exposed silver halide emulsion as a function of said development , and preferentially transferring , by diffusion , said more mobile oxidation product to a superposed image-receiving layer to impart thereto a visible color image which is a negative transfer image . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court held that Kodak had not carried its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 are invalid , and that Kodak had infringed those claims by making , using and selling its PR-10 film . 228 USPQ at 317 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Validity _NEWLINE_ Kodak says the process of its PR-10 film unit is the same as that disclosed in British *1563 Patent No . 840,731 and in three references based on inventions of K.E . Whitmore and P.M. Mader ( Whitmore-Mader ) . See 228 USPQ at 315 & n. 12 . It says the district court erred in failing to hold the '789 patent invalid for anticipation or obviousness based on its finding that : ( a ) because Whitmore-Mader calls for a `` subsequent treatment with ... strong alkali , '' following oxidation , it is a two-step , rather than a one-step , process ; and ( b ) Whitmore-Mader is of questionable utility and commercial value because of `` disadvantages '' . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( a ) `` One-step '' vs. `` Two Step '' _NEWLINE_ Kodak argues that Whitmore-Mader is not a two-step process , but merely requires two `` sequential reactions '' to release the dye , i.e. , an oxidation of the quinoneimide , followed by hydrolysis . It says the district court confused those `` two sequential chemical reactions with a two-step manipulative addition of reagents . '' ( Emphasis in original ) . Thus , it asserts , one skilled in the art would have found it to have been obvious to practice Whitmore-Mader by making the alkaline processing liquid sufficiently strong so that any subsequent treatment with a `` strong alkali '' would have been unnecessary ( i.e. , that Whitmore-Mader either anticipated or would have suggested the `` one-step '' process of both the '789 patent and Kodak 's PR-10 film ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Respecting the scope and content of the prior art , the district court found that : ( 1 ) the `` splittable coupler process '' of the British patent and the `` deamination process '' of Whitmore-Mader were `` relatively slow '' two-step processes ; and ( 2 ) the oxidation and cleaving reactions of the PR-10 and '789 processes take place in the alkaline processing composition and occur essentially simultaneously ( or , as Polaroid 's expert witness Rogers put it , `` in one fell swoop '' ) , 228 USPQ at 316-17 , making those processes `` one-step '' processes . On that basis , it further found that `` both [ PR-10 and '789 ] processes are fundamentally different from those described in the prior art . '' Id . at 317 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We have been shown no basis for reversing those findings , which are fully supportive of the district court 's finding that no reference anticipated the claims in suit . Nor have we been shown a basis for overturning its conclusion that the prior art references , read as a whole , would not have taught or suggested , i.e. , rendered obvious , the inventions set forth in claims 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 . Id . Kodak 's assertions , viewed in light of the undisturbed findings of record , form no basis for reversal . Those same assertions were made to and were convincingly rejected by the district court , whose findings , based on the testimony and evidence before it , have not been shown to have been clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( b ) `` Disadvantages '' _NEWLINE_ We need not consider Kodak 's assertions respecting the district court 's remark , 228 USPQ at 317 , that Whitmore-Mader 's process was of questionable utility and had disadvantages . Nothing in that remark indicates reversible error in the district court 's findings applicable to its determination that Kodak failed to meet its burden respecting validity of the '789 patent . See Richdel v. Sunspool , 714 F.2d 1573 , 1580 , 219 USPQ 8 , 12 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Infringement _NEWLINE_ Kodak says the district court erred in finding that the process of its PR-10 film unit uses : ( a ) a `` colored silver halide developing agent '' ( CSHDA ) as set forth in claim 5 ; and ( b ) an `` oxidation product '' within the meaning of that claim . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( a ) CSHDA _NEWLINE_ Noting that claim 5 calls for a `` colored silver halide developing agent '' , Kodak argues that the only compound in PR-10 capable of developing silver halide , and which does in fact develop silver halide , is the B & W developer . It says its process avoids infringement because its B & W developer is colorless , and thus is not a CSHDA because it does not meet the `` colored '' requirement of claim 5 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In rejecting the same argument raised at trial , the district court said Kodak 's noninfringement analysis was based on `` a strained and narrow '' reading of the '789 claims that hinged on the terminology Kodak selected to describe the respective processes , *1564 and , because those terms were inaccurate , Kodak 's argument failed . 228 USPQ at 316 . We agree . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response to Kodak 's contention that CSHDA 's are compounds `` which can and do `` develop silver halide ( and which consequently must be mobile ) , the district court noted that claim 5 called for development of silver halide not by but `` in the presence of '' a negative dye developer . 228 USPQ at 316 . It found that Polaroid 's auxiliary developer ( which it found the same as Kodak 's B & W developer ) functioned as an `` electron transfer agent '' that moved back and forth between the layers of dye developer and silver halide , oxidizing the former and reducing the latter . Id . at 316-17 . It also found that Kodak 's `` dye releasers '' , i.e . sulfonamidonaphthols , were in reality another species of negative dye developer which did not differ in reaction from Polaroid 's dye developers . Id . at 317 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Though Kodak urges on appeal that we hold the district court 's construction of the term `` developing agent '' to have been contrary to the disclosure of the '789 patent , we have been shown no compelling basis for doing so . The '789 specification discloses use of a silver halide developing agent `` which is also a dye and which yields an oxidation product which is more diffusible than the unoxidized portion thereof . '' Col. 2 , 11 . 50-52 . That disclosure of a relatively non-diffusible CSHDA is consistent with the district court 's determination that `` the patent does not require either explicitly or implicitly , that the dye developer be mobile before oxidation . '' 228 USPQ at 316 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Statements made by Polaroid during prosecution of U.S. Patent No . 2,983,606 ( of which '789 was a continuation in part ) with respect to positive dye developers have not , on the record before us , been shown sufficiently material to require a different conclusion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak acknowledges that '789 contemplates use of an auxiliary dye developer , but asserts that the district court 's infringement analysis improperly converted such `` optional '' use to an `` essential '' of the invention . We have been shown no compelling basis `` in light of the claim language , the other claims , the prior art , the prosecution history , and the specification , '' SRI International , Inc. v. Matsushita Electric Corp. , 775 F.2d 1107 , 1118 , 227 USPQ 577 , 583 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( in banc ) , for holding the district court 's infringement finding clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We see no merit in Kodak 's assertion that the district court `` remade '' the CSHDA element in the '789 invention in light of the accused product , or in view of the inventor 's testimony at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( b ) Oxidation Product _NEWLINE_ Kodak first says Claim 5 requires that the `` oxidation product '' of the silver halide developing agent be : ( 1 ) more mobile and diffusible in the processing liquid than the unoxidized developing agent , ( 2 ) colored , ( 3 ) of lower molecular weight than the unoxidized developer , and ( 4 ) preferentially transfered to the image receiver . That much is undisputed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Urging reversal , however , Kodak says its developing agent ( which it says is the colorless B & W developer ) meets none of those criteria . Kodak here plays mere word games . As above indicated , the district court found ( 1 ) that Kodak 's B & W developer corresponded to Polaroid 's auxiliary dye developer , and ( 2 ) that what Kodak called its `` dye releaser '' was in fact a `` developing agent '' as that term is used in the '789 patent . 228 USPQ at 317 . The auxiliary dye developer/B & W developer is not the oxidation product . As the district court noted , Kodak 's argument falls when accurate terminology is used . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Alternatively , accepting the district court 's finding that its `` dye releaser '' was a `` dye developer '' as claimed , Kodak asserts that a finding of non-infringement was nonetheless required because , while the process of the '789 patent uses an oxidation reaction to release the dye , the process of its PR-10 film unit uses `` the subsequent hydrolysis . '' That assumes , for infringement purposes , that `` oxidation '' and `` hydrolysis '' constitute two distinct steps in the negative dye transfer process . We can not credit Kodak 's argument . *1565 First , it is undercut by Kodak 's validity argument ( made with respect to the Whitmore-Mader references ) that `` oxidation '' and `` hydrolysis '' constitute two reactions in a one-step process . Second , it does not establish that the district court 's contrary finding ( that `` the reaction mechanisms [ of ] '789 and PR-10 are the same '' , 228 USPQ at 317 ) was clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( c ) Miscellaneous _NEWLINE_ Kodak argues that : `` the '789 patent hardly deserves the generous interpretation the district court gave it , '' saying its PR-10 process was `` independently discovered and developed , '' and its accused product enjoys `` widespread commercial acceptance . '' Kodak points to nothing that would establish a nexus of those allegations to the issue of infringement . Mere arguments of counsel on appeal do not constitute the showing needed to undermine a district court 's factual findings . Similarly , Kodak 's mere assertion that `` the processes differ in kind '' is insufficient to show clear error in the district court 's finding , 228 USPQ at 317 , that they are the same . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 5 ) U.S. Patent Nos . 3,594,165 and 3,689,262 _NEWLINE_ The '262 patent issued as a continuation-in-part of the '165 patent . Because of their similarity , the district court and the parties have treated them together , as will we . Polaroid asserted infringement of claims 3 , 5 , and 6 of each patent . Representative claim 3 of the '165 patent reads : _NEWLINE_ 3 . A photographic film unit as defined in claim 1 wherein said opacifying agent is present in said processing composition in a quantity effective , upon distribution on the surface of said photosensitive laminate , to prevent exposure of said photosensitive silver halide layer during processing in the presence of radiation actinic thereto and incident on distributed processing composition and said opaque layer is effective to prevent exposure of said photosensitive silver halide layer during processing in the presence of radiation actinic thereto and incident on said opaque layer . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court held that Kodak had failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 3 , 5 , and 6 of the '165/'262 patents are invalid , and found that Kodak had infringed those claims by making , using and selling its PR-10 film . 228 USPQ at 321 . Kodak appeals from only the validity portion of the judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Validity _NEWLINE_ Kodak says a person of ordinary skill in the art , viewing U.S . Patents Nos . 3,415,645 ( '645 patent ) and 3,053,659 ( '659 patent ) or 3,309,201 ( '201 patent ) , would have found it to have been obvious to replace the opaque cover sheet disclosed in the '645 patent with the `` alternative delayed opacification means '' ( opaque processing liquid ) taught in the '659 patent . Kodak asserts that that `` obvious substitution '' would have resulted in the invention of asserted claims 3 , 5 , and 6 of '165/'262 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '645 patent was cited to the Examiner and thoroughly considered during prosecution of the '165/'262 patents . 228 USPQ at 319 . See also American Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , Inc. , 725 F.2d at 1359 , 220 USPQ at 770 . Kodak 's validity challenge is virtually identical to that advanced by the Examiner in rejecting claims of Application Serial No . 815,585 ( of which '165 was a continuation-in-part ) : _NEWLINE_ Hence , it would not be [ sic , have been ] unobvious to place the opacifier-containing processing solution between the transparent impermeable layer of Land '645 and thus eliminate the opaque sheet of claim 47 of Land '645 and at the same time replacing the opacifier-containing solution of Land '646 with the alkaline processing solution-permeable opaque layer dispensed from land '645 to obtain the element and processes of the instant claims since the changes involved are of optional routine nature in the art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In its response to the Examiner , Polaroid remarked that , absent the specific disclosure in its application , the '644 , '645 , and '646 references , considered singly or as a whole , would not have suggested or *1566 taught the claimed invention . Specifically , it said : _NEWLINE_ [ T ] here is absolutely no suggestion in the cited references of distributing a processing composition on the exposure surface of a photosensitive laminate of the claimed structure , intermediate such exposure surface structure and a separate transparent sheet element , and/or the employment of a processing composition containing opacifying agent present in such composition to prevent , during processing of the film unit , photoexposure of the unit to actinic radiation incident on the exposure surface of the film unit , in combination with protection of the film unit 's additional major surface from exposing actinic radiation incident on the film 's viewing surface by means of a preformed opaque layer positioned intermediate the image-receiving and photosensitive silver halide components of the unit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following reconsideration , the Examiner issued a Notice of Allowance on July 30 , 1970 . On October 30 , 1970 Polaroid entered a Notice of Abandonment of the application , but not the invention , in favor of its continuation-in-part Serial No . 39,646 ( which issued as the '165 patent ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak resurrects the Examiner 's rejection , substituting '659 and '201 for '644 and '646 and saying , incredibly , that the district court `` overlooked the existence of the '645 patent , which teaches every element of the '165/'262 invention except the opacification technique taught by '659 and '201 . '' That argument is without merit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court specifically discussed the '645 patent and rejected Kodak 's assertion that `` the only difference between '' the '645 and '165/ '262 patents was the manner in which the `` delayed '' opaque layer is constructed after exposure , finding that `` the evidence does not support the premise of identity between the '645 and '165/'262 patents , even before processing . '' 228 USPQ at 319 . It found that '645 did not disclose : the photosensitive laminate of '165/ ' 262 ; the manner of adhesion of the corresponding layers ; use of a single opaque layer to act as both light barrier and white background ; and use of separate , preformed black and white layers . 228 USPQ at 319-20 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak contends that the district court `` erred fundamentally '' in stating that `` the specifications of '165/262 and claims 3 , 5 , and 6 of those patents , read together , clearly provide for separate , preformed black and white layers . '' 228 USPQ at 320 . Kodak correctly says none of the claims provides for separate black-and-white layers . Thus , reliance alone on separate black and white layers as a claim element , if that reliance occurred , would have insufficiently supported the district court 's validity conclusion . The statement to which Kodak refers , however , is but one of a number of considerations set forth by the district court as forming the basis for its conclusion : other elements identified and relied on in the district court 's analysis , such as `` the photosensitive laminate '' and `` use of a single opaque layer to act as both light barrier and white background , '' find full support in the claims . Id . We are not persuaded that the district court 's statement about black-and white layers indicates that it overemphasized that element as alone sufficiently distinguishing over prior art , or that the statement otherwise compels reversal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '659 and '201 patents were thoroughly considered by the district court . 228 USPQ at 320 . Both relate to `` peel apart '' film units . The '659 patent is directed to film units used primarily for x-ray images . The district court found that : ( 1 ) the '659 film units `` are not arranged and do not function in the manner of the 165/262 film units , '' and do not permit the forming of the image to be viewed ; ( 2 ) '659 does not disclose the photosensitive laminate of '165/'262 or the opaque layers permeable to the processing composition ; ( 3 ) Figure 10 of the '659 patent does not teach the functional equivalent of an opaque flap and opaque goo , but uses an opaque envelope for processing the transparencies ; and ( 4 ) if opaque goo were substituted for the envelope , the resulting unit would be non-functional . 228 USPQ at 320 . Kodak has *1567 shown none of those findings to have been clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The '201 patent is directed to film units for making 35mm film transparencies . The district court held that the disclosure in that reference of an opaque processing composition between the positive and negative layers would not have suggested the structure of the '165/'262 film unit . 228 USPQ at 320 . Kodak has shown no error in that holding . Recognizing the non-controlling nature of the fact , the district court noted that Kodak , in seeking its own patent on the invention disclosed in the '165/'262 patents , had vigorously argued the non-applicability of the very prior art it was extolling at trial . 228 USPQ at 320-21 . Kodak argues here that the invention was conceived by its `` young and inexperienced '' attorney Cole , and was therefore obvious . Beyond the distinction between conception and invention , the argument does not reflect error in the district court 's analysis , as above described , of the prior art and the invention . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Lastly in respect of the '165/'262 patents , Kodak says the district court failed to consider the prior art as a whole , but cites no support for that assertion . In framing the validity issue under ¡± 103 , 228 USPQ at 320 , the district court correctly said : `` the issue is whether in view of the cited prior art , the similarities between the subject matter of '165/'262 and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious , '' citing this court 's decisions in Thomas & Betts Corp. v. Litton Systems , Inc. , 720 F.2d 1572 , 1579 , 220 USPQ 1 , 6 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) , and Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson , 745 F.2d 1437 , 223 USPQ 603 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . Kodak points to nothing in the district court 's Memorandum Decision or in the record to persuade us that the district court departed from the requirement for consideration of the prior art and the claimed invention as wholes when applying ¡± 103 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 6 ) U.S. Patent No . 3,578,540 _NEWLINE_ Polaroid alleged infringement of claims 5 and 6 ( which depend from claims 1 and 4 ) and 8 ( which depends from claim 7 ) of the '540 patent . The subject matter of claims 1 and 4 ( drawn to `` a laminated photographic product including a transfer image '' ) is described in the district court 's opinion . 228 USPQ at 327 . Claims 5 and 6 read : _NEWLINE_ 5 . A photographic product as defined in claim 4 wherein said support layers are relatively impermeable to water vapor . _NEWLINE_ 6 . A photographic product as defined in claim 4 wherein said support layers are formed of polyesters derived from ethylene glycol terephthalic acid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The subject matter of claim Claim 7 is also drawn to `` a laminated photographic product '' . Claim 8 reads : _NEWLINE_ 8 . A photographic product as defined in claim 7 wherein said laminae comprising said image-containing layer are hydrophilic and contain water and said support layers are relatively impermeable to water vapor . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court held that Kodak failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 5 , 6 and 8 are invalid , and found that Kodak infringed those claims by making , using and selling its PR-10 film . Kodak appeals from only the validity portion of the judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Validity _NEWLINE_ Asserting that the district court erroneously defined the invention of the '540 patent as drawn to the `` concept of symmetry '' , Kodak says the district court failed to view the claimed structure in view of the prior art as a whole . Kodak urged invalidity in view of three prior art references : U.S. Patent No . 2,563,342 ( '342 patent ) , U.S. Patent No . 2,983,606 ( '606 patent ) , and its own BIMAT process . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( a ) '342 Patent _NEWLINE_ The district court , says Kodak , ignored its own findings that `` one of the objects of the [ '342 ] patent is to obtain greater resistance to curling , '' and that `` it attempts to do so by the use of two support layers made of the same material , cellulose acetate . '' 228 USPQ at 328 . It is Kodak , however , which ignores the district court 's *1568 finding ( which immediately followed the quoted material ) that the '342 patent `` does not teach the feasibility of using symmetrical water-impermeable supports which by definition will maintain a wet environment for a period of time . '' Id . That finding with respect to the scope and content of the prior art has not been shown to have been clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the district found , supra , the '342 patent claims a photographic film unit , i.e . a structure , having `` greater resistance to curling '' . The specification discloses , at Col. 2 , lines 39-53 , a preferred embodiment comprising : a transparent `` base layer '' ( preferably formed from a cellulosic film base such as cellulose acetate ) ; a layer of photosensitive material on the inner surface of the base layer ; an opaque water permeable layer of `` good protective colloid '' forming a unit with the photosensitive layer ; and a transparent `` backing layer '' ( which may also be formed of cellulose acetate , Col. 3 , lines 25-27 ) . The photosensitive layer is exposed through the base layer . Col. 3 , lines 66-69 . Because the positive photographic image is `` supported on the relatively non-curling base layer , '' it remains flat during and after processing . Col. 4 , lines 71-73 . The specification expressly teaches an `` additional advantage '' when the `` relatively expensive '' base layer is used as a support for the final positive image because it `` imparts desirable physical characteristics thereto . '' Col. 4 , lines 73-75 , Col. 5 , lines 1-3 . Contrary to Kodak 's recharacterization of the '342 patent , we have been shown nothing in the '342 specification to undermine the district court 's finding that the '342 patent did not teach the use of symmetrical , water-impermeable supports as claimed in the '540 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ That conclusion is further supported by disclosure in the '342 specification that , in other embodiments , the transparent backing layer may be replaced with an opaque , white image-carrying layer formed of a material such as baryta paper ( which allows two positive images to be formed ) , Col. 5 , lines 4-12 , or may be eliminated altogether , Col. 6 , lines 9-15 . No support-related disadvantages are attributed to those embodiments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( b ) '606 Patent _NEWLINE_ Resurrecting a reference cited during prosecution , Kodak says the '606 patent disclosed `` the structure of the claimed film unit , but does not dictate the selection of any particular material as a support . '' That patent was thoroughly considered by the Examiner , and was convincingly distinguished in the '540 specification , Col. 2 , line 36 through Col. 4 , line 9 . See American Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , Inc. , 725 F.2d at 1359 , 220 USPQ at 770 . Having fully considered the testimony and documents before it , the district court concluded that the '606 patent `` certainly does not teach the use of water-impermeable symmetrical supports . '' 228 USPQ at 328 . Though the court also said `` I do not find the concept of symmetry to have been obvious even to a person of the high skill necessary in this field , '' id . that statement can only be read as shorthand for `` use of water-impermeable symmetrical supports , '' supra . Kodak 's assertion that the district court somehow improperly disposed of the '606 patent by reducing the obviousness analysis to nothing more than a search for a `` concept of symmetry '' is utterly unsupported by the decision or the record and deserves no further discussion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( c ) BIMAT _NEWLINE_ Kodak points to its BIMAT process as demonstrating knowledge in the art that film units having polyester supports on both sides are flat and distortion-free . The district court described the BIMAT process in its Memorandum Decision , 228 USPQ at 328 , noting that after development of the transfer image the image-layer on the polyester sheet was wet and sticky , and that that sheet would therefore often be covered with a second transparent polyester support to permit handling of the film-thus creating a transparency , not a reflection print . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to the differences between the BIMAT reference and the claimed invention , the district court found : ( 1 ) Kodak never regarded BIMAT as a permanently *1569 closed system ; ( 2 ) the BIMAT laminate is made of two long strips of film , not discrete film units ; ( 3 ) the BIMAT `` photograph '' so produced will last only ten days unless the gelatin layer is washed and dried ; and ( 4 ) the BIMAT sandwich is filled only with hardened gelatin , the transferred silver halide , and a residue of processing material , thus differing fundamentally from the multiplicity of layers and retained moisture in an integral film unit . Id . at 328 . On the basis of those findings , none of which Kodak has shown to have been clearly erroneous , the district court properly rejected Kodak 's allegations of anticipation , and correctly concluded that the BIMAT process would not have taught use of symmetrical water-impermeable supports in a sealed , integral film unit to prevent curling or distortion . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( d ) Secondary Considerations _NEWLINE_ Kodak says Polaroid merely concocted a story at trial to `` explain '' film unit distortion , dubbed that theory an `` insight '' , and called the `` so-called solution '' derived from that theory `` symmetry '' . See 228 USPQ at 327-328 . It dismisses Polaroid 's `` real world story '' as meritless and irrelevant , asserting that the inventor merely applied the best material available ( polyester ) to an old combination , which `` simple expedient '' it said was taught and suggested in the prior art . Those same assertions were made and rejected at trial . Their resurrection on appeal simply disregards the district court 's contrary finding that the invention of the '540 patent involves substantially more than the choice of a known material . Id . at 328 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak 's attempt to recharacterize the trial record falls far short of establishing clear error in the district court 's conclusion respecting the validity issue . Similarly , Kodak 's attack on Polaroid 's trial theory is both unavailing and irrelevant , the burden being on Kodak to show reversible error in the district court 's judgment . With respect to that burden , we have been shown no basis for questioning the district court 's findings with respect to objective indicia of non-obviousness . 228 USPQ at 328-29 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( e ) The Prior Art as a Whole _NEWLINE_ Finally , Kodak asserts that the district court failed to view the references `` as a whole '' . We reject that contention . Though the district court never expressly said it had considered the prior art `` as a whole '' , Kodak has shown no basis for our concluding that the district court , which , as above indicated , repeatedly articulated the correct standard under ¡± 103 , see , e.g. , 228 USPQ 320 , veered from the proper standard . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 7 ) U.S. Patent No . 3,753,392 _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 of the '392 patent reads : _NEWLINE_ 1 . Photographic apparatus comprising : _NEWLINE_ a film assemblage including _NEWLINE_ a cassette having means defining an exit in one end of said cassette through which a film unit is adapted to be moved subsequent to exposure , an opening near an opposite end of said cassette and an exposure aperture ; _NEWLINE_ a plurality of thin , flexible film units located within said cassette in stacked relation with a foremost of said film units being adapted to be urged into a position adjacent said exposure aperture with a first edge of said foremost film unit in alignment with said exit and a second edge opposite said first edge positioned adjacent said opening ; _NEWLINE_ a camera including _NEWLINE_ means for receiving said cassette ; _NEWLINE_ first film-advancing means adapted to extend into said opening for engaging said foremost film unit at said second edge thereof and moving said foremost film unit , subsequent to exposure , through said exit ; _NEWLINE_ second film-advancing means including a pair of rollers adapted to receive said first edge of said foremost film unit as it moves through said exit ; _NEWLINE_ motor means ; and _NEWLINE_ means coupled to said motor means for driving said first film-advancing means to move said first edge of said foremost film unit through said exit and for driving said second film-advancing means while said foremost film unit is *1570 in engagement therewith to rupture a container of processing liquid mounted on said foremost film unit and spread the contents thereof between elements of said foremost film unit as said foremost film unit is advanced toward the exterior of said camera . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court held that : ( a ) Kodak failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 12 are invalid , ( b ) Kodak infringed all but claim 12 , by making , using and selling EK-6 cameras and PR-10 film , ( c ) Kodak failed to carry its burden of establishing unenforceability . 228 USPQ at 335-36 . Kodak appeals from only the validity and enforceability portions of the judgment . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Validity _NEWLINE_ The district court found that the relevant art to which the '392 patent pertains is camera design . 228 USPQ at 333 . It categorized the prior art as ( 1 ) patents disclosing front picking mechanisms ; ( 2 ) patents disclosing rear picking mechanisms ; and ( 3 ) a number of commercial cameras . Id . at 333-34 . Kodak says , and we disagree , that the district court failed to consider the prior art as a whole . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( a ) Claim Construction _NEWLINE_ The district court , says Kodak , improperly limited the element `` first film-advancing means '' in claim 1 to a preferred embodiment in the '392 specification ( i.e . a `` rear pick , which is shaped like a hook '' , 228 USPQ at 333 ) , and permitted that `` narrow '' construction to dominate its analysis of the prior art . Kodak says that was contrary to ¡± 112 , which requires that means-plus-function claims be construed to encompass `` equivalents '' , citing D.M.I. , Inc. v. John Deere & Co. , 755 F.2d 1570 , 1573 , 225 USPQ 236 , 238 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . It says prior art structures that perform the function of a `` first film advancing means '' render obvious the inventions set forth in the claims of the '392 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak 's argument is without merit . First , it is based on a truncation of the claim language on which it rests . That language is limited to film advancing means `` adapted to extend into said opening for engaging said foremost film unit at said second edge thereof and moving said foremost film unit , subsequent to exposure , through said exit '' . Read , as it must be , in the context of the entire claim , that language limits the `` means '' to that disclosed in the patent and equivalents which engage the `` second edge '' , i.e . rear edge , of the film unit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Second , as stated in D.M.I. , ¡± 112 requires `` that the limitation shall be construed to cover the structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof . '' 755 F.2d at 1574 , 225 USPQ at 238 ( emphasis in original ) . Here , as an initial matter , the district court properly construed `` first film advancing means '' in light of the structure described in the specification . 228 USPQ at 333 . It went on to note , however , Polaroid 's statement to the PTO during prosecution that the claims were limited to `` a rear pick that engaged the film unit ... only at the trailing 'edge ' . '' Id . at 334 . Kodak has not shown error in the district court 's finding that , in view of that prosecution history , it was compelled to read the claims as limited to a rear pick . Id . We will not `` undertake the speculative inquiry '' into why the limitation was entered , or whether it was directed to one purpose Kodak alleges ( i.e. , `` avoiding deflection of the leading end of the film unit out of alignment with the cassette 's exit slot '' ) , but not to others . Cf . Kinzenbaw v. John Deere & Co. , 741 F.2d 383 , 389 , 222 USPQ 929 , 933 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) , cert . denied , 470 U.S. 1004 , 105 S.Ct . 1357 , 84 L.Ed.2d 379 ( 1985 ) . Thus , whether applied in determining validity or infringement , the broad scope argued in Kodak 's brief would be inappropriate . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( b ) Front-Pick References _NEWLINE_ Saying the district court erred in deeming the front-pick patents inapposite , Kodak wants us to hold otherwise . In view of its correct claim construction , however , we see no error whatever in the district court 's conclusion that the front-pick patents , either singly or in combination , would neither have taught nor suggested `` [ t ] hat a pick can push the film unit and that it can do so *1571 while fully maintaining the latter 's physical integrity . '' 228 USPQ at 334 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Combination of References _NEWLINE_ Kodak cites a PTO position that two front-pick patents , No . 3,447,437 ( '437 patent ) and No . 3,511,152 ( '152 patent ) disclosed all elements of Polaroid 's '392 patent except the one found lacking by the district court ( i.e. , a rear-pick that can push a film unit while maintaining its physical integrity ) . 228 USPQ at 334 . That element , says Kodak , is disclosed in U.S. Patent No 3,460,452 ( '452 patent ) . Kodak then says the '437 and '152 patents teach `` advancement of a film unit into rollers for spreading purposes '' , the teaching found lacking in the '452 patent by the district court . Thus , Kodak would have us pick and choose individual elements from three prior patents and thereby re-create the invention claimed in the '392 patent . Kodak does not tell us , however , what there is in the three prior patents that would have suggested such picking and choosing at the time the invention was made . Interconnect Planning Corp. v. Feil , 774 F.2d 1132 , 1143 , 227 USPQ 543 , 551 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The disclosures of the '452 , '437 , and '152 patents were either considered , American Hoist & Derrick Co. v. Sowa & Sons , Inc. , 725 F.2d at 1359 , 220 USPQ at 770 , or were deemed by the district court to have been considered by the Examiner , see E.I . Du Pont de Nemours v. Berkley & Co. , Inc. , 620 F.2d 1247 , 1267 , 205 USPQ 1 , 16 ( 8th Cir.1980 ) . Moreover , there is much in those three prior art patents , from the front and rear of which Kodak has picked , that counters the notion that they would together have rendered obvious the claimed inventions of the '392 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that the '452 patent discloses a `` scanning camera '' that never was built because the structure proved too complex to be practical ; that employed a film transport totally different from that of the '392 patent , moving film out of the pack with a manually-operated lever mounted in the pack and not part of the camera ; that reversed the roller direction following exposure of the film , then broke the pod and spread the processing composition on the return trip ; and that did not push the film into the rollers for spreading purposes . 228 USPQ at 334 . Kodak has not shown the district court 's findings on those differences to have been clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that the '437 and '152 patents , both `` front pick '' patents , were `` inapposite '' because they operated `` either on the surface of the film unit or by entering holes in the film unit , '' i.e. , on the principle that the film unit has to be pulled out of the film unit . 228 USPQ at 334 . The court also found that U.S . Patents Nos . 1,070,400 to Brieloff and 1,626,600 to Fish would neither have worked with an instant film unit nor have suggested the invention of the '392 patent . Id . It concluded that `` none of the prior art patents or cameras had to solve the practical problems '' solved in the '392 patent , and that the invention claimed in that patent would not have been obvious . Id . at 335 . Kodak has shown no error in the findings underlying that conclusion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In sum , we have been shown nothing that might remotely indicate that Kodak has carried its appellant 's burden of establishing error in the district court 's conclusion that nothing in the prior art , taken singly or in `` combination '' , rendered obvious the inventions claimed in the '392 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Unenforceability _NEWLINE_ Noting that Polaroid had not disclosed the '452 patent to the PTO , Kodak asserts that the district court erred in weighing the materiality of that patent . The district court , having explicated the differences listed above , rejected Kodak 's assertion of materiality , finding that the '452 patent was not more pertinent than the prior art cited to and considered by the Examiner . 228 USPQ at 335 . We have been shown no basis on which that finding , and thus the district court 's determination on unenforceability , could be reversed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ( 8 ) U.S. Patent No . 3,753,211 _NEWLINE_ At trial , Polaroid alleged infringement of claims 8 , 9 , and 10 of the '211 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 8 reads : _NEWLINE_ *1572 8 . A self-developing camera comprising : _NEWLINE_ means for receiving a film unit ; _NEWLINE_ a housing member having film unit exit means ; _NEWLINE_ means for exposing said film unit ; _NEWLINE_ means for distributing a processing fluid across the exposed portion of said film unit responsive to said film unit 's being progressively advanced therepast , said exit means being positioned with respect to said fluid distributing means so that , in the course of advancing said film unit after exposure thereof past said fluid distributing means and thence through said exit means , a first fluid treated section of said exposed film unit is accessible exteriorly of said camera and thus exposed to ambient light while a second section of said exposed film unit extends on the opposite side of said fluid distributing means from said exit means being yet untreated with said fluid , with another section of said exposed film unit being disposed intermediate said fluid distributing means and said exit means , said exit means being disposed out of the path said exposed film unit would normally follow as it emerged from said fluid distributing means ; and _NEWLINE_ means for deflecting said exposed film unit from the path it would normally follow as it initially emerged from said fluid distributing means and guiding it towards said exit means . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court determined that : ( a ) Kodak failed to carry its burden of proving facts requiring a holding that claims 8 and 9 are invalid ; ( b ) Claim 10 is invalid ; ( c ) Kodak infringed claim 8 by making , using and selling its EK-4 and EK-6 cameras ; ( d ) Kodak did not infringe claim 9 ; ( e ) if claim 10 were valid , it was infringed ; and ( f ) Kodak failed to carry its burden of establishing unenforceability . 228 USPQ at 340 . Polaroid does not appeal from the judgment that claim 10 is invalid or that claim 9 is not infringed . Kodak appeals from only those portions of the judgment dealing with claim 8 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Validity _NEWLINE_ Arguing only anticipation , Kodak says claim 8 of the '211 patent is anticipated by Patent No . 3,405,619 ( '619 patent ) , and that the district court erred in distinguishing the '619 patent because it did not disclose `` spreading '' effects not claimed in the '211 patent . The district court , says Kodak , required the prior art to `` teach '' functions and alleged benefits of the claimed invention not set forth in the claims . Kodak then says Polaroid cancelled all claims to spreading effects during prosecution , and that claim 8 must be seen as drawn only to structure . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court rejected Kodak 's anticipation argument `` based on a reading of the claims of '211 without any reference whatever to the specifications . '' 228 USPQ at 337 . Agreeing that the specification can not be used to expand the patent grant , citing United States v. Adams , 383 U.S. 39 , 49 , 86 S.Ct . 708 , 713 , 15 L.Ed.2d 572 , 148 USPQ 479 ( 1966 ) , the district court stated : _NEWLINE_ The claims asserted here describe a structure of defined dimensions and characteristics , as well as the change worked by that structure on the normal path traveled by the film unit out of the rollers and camera . The specifications explain the effect of the changed path of travel . Without consideration of an invention 's object and beneficial results , the novelty of most inventions would often be elusive . Accordingly , I consider the prior art not simply as it describes particular camera structures but also as those structures affect the film unit . _NEWLINE_ 228 USPQ at 337 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ That approach of the district court in this case was eminently proper . Claim 8 includes a limitation to `` means for distributing a processing fluid '' , in which `` means for deflecting [ the ] exposed film unit '' play an important ancillary role in achieving a superior development of the photograph . Understanding what is claimed by those structural `` means '' is possible only with reference to the specification , which teaches that means which deflect the film unit : *1573 ( 1 ) increase its path within the light-protected structure , thereby alleviating the problem of light-piping ; and ( 2 ) cause the thinning of the layer of developer fluid and improvement in the fluid meniscus ( i.e. , `` spreading '' ) . See 228 USPQ at 337 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court , noting that the '619 patent disclosed a self-developing scanning camera and was in the class of art searched by the Examiner , E.I . Du Pont de Nemours v. Berkley & Co. , Inc. , 620 F.2d at 1267 , 205 USPQ at 16 , found no anticipation because : the `` curved passage '' of the '619 camera was not intended to be a light-shielding mechanism , and was not disclosed as so functioning ; the '619 patent did not teach bending the film unit to improve spreading of the processing composition ; and the '619 patent discloses a design for use with peel-apart film , which does not present the same light-piping problems as does integral film . 228 USPQ at 228 . Those findings not having been shown to have been clearly erroneous , Kodak 's argument that claim 8 is anticipated by the disclosure in the '619 patent must fall . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak further asserts that its accused cameras are identical to the structure disclosed in U.S. Patent No . 3,350,991 to Murphy . If that were true , there would be error , for `` that which infringes if later anticipates if earlier . '' Peters v. Active Manufacturing Co. , 129 U.S. 530 , 537 , 9 S.Ct . 389 , 392 , 32 L.Ed . 738 ( 1889 ) . Kodak 's assertion , however , is based on the testimony of its expert witness Kaprelian , who said the film exit of Kodak 's cameras was in line with the film 's normal path . Polaroid 's expert testified in direct opposition to that statement of Kaprelian . Kaprelian was cross-examined on the point . The district court heard and evaluated Kaprelian 's testimony , along with other testimony and the evidence , and entered its findings contrary to Kaprelian 's statement . 228 USPQ at 338 . Kodak has cited no authority , and there can be none , to support its suggestion that we substitute an independent , de novo evaluation of Kaprelian 's testimony for that made by the district court . Trial courts have and must continue to have the right to reject the testimony of a witness , a right that can be defeated only when clear error is shown . Anderson v. City of Bessemer City , 470 U.S. 564 , 105 S.Ct . 1504 , 1511 , 84 L.Ed.2d 518 ( 1985 ) ; The American Original Corp. v. Jenkins Food Corp. , 774 F.2d at 462 , 227 USPQ at 300 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . That a trial court 's opinion does not contain language expressly discrediting a witness ' testimony does not license an appellate court to reweigh that witnesses ' testimony and to make its own credibility determinations . Kodak 's reassertion of Kaprelian 's statement in a vacuum is insufficient to show clear error in the district court 's findings and does not , therefore , sustain its burden on appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Infringement _NEWLINE_ Citing SRI International v. Matsushita Electric Corp. 775 F.2d 1107 , 227 USPQ 577 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) ( in banc ) , Kodak says its accused cameras escape infringement under the reverse doctrine of equivalents . It argues that : the '211 patent discloses achievement of a `` squared fluid mass '' through the use of cartridge projections not used in the accused cameras ; Kodak found thinning of processing fluid by bending the film undesirable , and overcame the problem by increasing in the accused cameras the space between the layers in the film unit . Thus , Kodak says it achieves its squared fluid mass in a different manner-through use of a special TOPAR pod and supports of unequal thickness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Those assertions were made to the district court , which rejected them . 228 USPQ at 340 . Kodak 's argument simply ignores the district court 's findings that Kodak 's `` exit spring '' is an integral part of the accused cameras , and that it acted as a means of deflecting the film , narrowing the exit means and taking it out of the normal path of the film . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court heard Kodak 's assertions that it knew from experiments conducted in 1970-71 of the relationship between deflection and developer layer thickness and that it had pursued its own development program . Nonetheless , the district court determined on all the evidence that the accused cameras did not escape infringement . That is a finding of fact . See *1574 SRI International , supra , 775 F.2d at 1122-24 , 227 USPQ at 587-88 . It has not on this record been shown to have been clearly erroneous . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ Kodak having failed to show that the judgment portions appealed from were based on clearly erroneous findings or errors in law , the appealed portions of the judgment are in all respects affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 789 F.2d 1556 , 54 USLW 2584 , 229 U.S.P.Q . 561 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Kodak cited in its ¡± 282 notice 137 prior patents in relation to the seven patents now on appeal .

To obtain approval for a new drug , an applicant may file a New Drug Application ( `` NDA '' ) that includes examples of the proposed label for the drug and clinical data demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective for use . Id . ¡± 355 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , ( b ) ( 1 ) ( F ) . The NDA must contain the patent number and expiration date of any patent that claims either the drug or a method of using the drug if `` a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted . '' Id . ¡± 355 ( b ) ( 1 ) . The FDA publishes the names of approved drugs and their associated patent information in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations list , commonly referred to as the `` Orange Book . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ An applicant seeking approval to market a generic version of a drug may file either an Abbreviated New Drug Application ( `` ANDA '' ) or a `` 505 ( b ) ( 2 ) application , '' which is also known as a `` paper NDA . '' Id . ¡± 355 ( b ) ( 2 ) , ( j ) . An ANDA allows an applicant to rely on the safety and efficacy information for the listed drug if the applicant can show that the generic drug is `` bioequivalent '' to the listed drug . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ An ANDA has three requirements that are particularly relevant here . First , the applicant must demonstrate that `` the route of administration , the dosage form , and the strength of the new drug are the same as those of the listed drug , '' unless the FDA has approved a `` suitability petition '' requesting permission to file an ANDA that differs from the listed drug in one or more of these respects . Id . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( iii ) , ( j ) ( 2 ) ( C ) . Second , subject to changes required by FDA regulations or a successful suitability petition , the applicant must also show that `` the labeling proposed for the new drug is the same as the labeling approved for the listed *1046 drug . '' Id . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( v ) . Third , for each patent listed in the Orange Book that claims either the listed drug or a use of the listed drug for which the applicant is requesting approval , an ANDA must include either one of four certifications or a `` section viii statement . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ If an applicant chooses to submit a certification , the applicant must certify `` ( I ) that ... patent information has not been filed , ( II ) that such patent has expired , ( III ) ... the date on which such patent will expire , or ( IV ) that such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture , use , or sale of the new drug . '' Id . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( vii ) ( I ) - ( IV ) . These certifications are referred to as Paragraph I , II , III , and IV certifications , respectively . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Assuming all regulatory requirements are satisfied , the FDA may immediately make effective the approval of an ANDA that includes either a Paragraph I or II certification . Id . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( i ) . By contrast , the filing of a Paragraph III or IV certification may delay the effective date of an ANDA approval , and , in the case of a Paragraph IV certification , invite a patent infringement suit . See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( e ) ( 2 ) , 21 U.S.C . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 5 ) ( B ) ( ii ) - ( iii ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ If , however , an applicant is seeking approval for a method of use not claimed in a `` method of use patent '' associated with the listed drug , the applicant must submit a section viii statement declaring that the patent does not claim such a use . 21 U.S.C . ¡± 355 ( j ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( viii ) . The applicant must also remove or `` carve out '' any mention of the patented method of use from the proposed label for the generic drug . See 21 C.F.R . ¡± 314.92 ( a ) ( 1 ) ; Novo Nordisk A/S v. Caraco Pharm . Labs. , Ltd. , 601 F.3d 1359 , 1361 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) ( `` Along with the section viii statement , the generic manufacturer must submit a proposed label to the FDA that does not contain the patented method of using the listed drug. '' ) . Unlike a Paragraph III or IV certification , the filing of a section viii statement will not by itself delay approval of an ANDA . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , in contrast to an ANDA , a paper NDA must include safety and effectiveness data . 21 U.S.C . ¡± 355 ( b ) ( 2 ) . However , a paper NDA may rely on safety and effectiveness data not developed by the applicant . Id . As with an ANDA , a paper NDA requires the applicant to submit either a patent certification or a statement declaring that the patent does not claim the method of use for which the applicant is seeking approval . Id . ¡± 355 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) - ( B ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . AstraZeneca 's Budesonide Drug and Patents _NEWLINE_ In 2000 , the FDA approved AstraZeneca 's NDA for a budesonide inhalation suspension that AstraZeneca now markets under the name `` PULMICORT RESPULES ( r ) . '' Each `` respule '' is a plastic vial containing a single dose of budesonide , an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid , suspended in a sterile liquid . The drug is administered by squeezing the entire contents of a vial into a jet nebulizer and inhaling the resulting mist through a mask attached to the nebulizer . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Orange Book entry for AstraZeneca 's budesonide product includes the ¡¬ 099 Patent and its parent , the ¡¬603 Patent . Both patents are owned by AstraZeneca and have specifications that are nearly identical in all relevant respects . The patents explain that `` [ t ] he invention provides a new method of treating respiratory diseases such as asthma that involves administering a budesonide composition with a nebulizer not more than once per day . '' ¡¬ 603 Patent col.1 ll.20-23 ; ¡¬099 Patent col.1 ll.26-29 . `` The invention also features a kit for treating respiratory diseases , the kit including a budesonide composition in a *1047 sealed container ... and a label indicating administration by nebulization in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day . '' ¡¬603 Patent col.2 ll.1-6 ; ¡¬ 099 Patent col.2 ll.7-12 . Both patents include method claims directed to administering a budesonide composition once daily and product claims directed to the described kit containing either a budesonide composition or suspension and a label indicating once-daily administration by nebulization . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While AstraZeneca 's patents are directed to once-daily treatment , the label that accompanies AstraZeneca 's budesonide product indicates that the drug may be administered once or twice daily . The label states that the drug is available in three strengths-0.25 mg , 0.5 mg , and 1.0 mg per 2 mL vial-and provides a table of recommended starting doses based on a patient 's history of therapy . The label repeatedly warns that patients should `` titrate down '' to the lowest effective dose of the medication to avoid any adverse effects from excessive use of the medication . For example , in its DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section , the label states that `` [ i ] n all patients , it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved '' and `` [ o ] nce the desired clinical effect is achieved , consideration should be given to tapering to the lowest effective dose . '' The PRECAUTIONS section also warns that `` suppression of HPA function may be associated ... when the dose is not titrated to the lowest effective dose '' and `` [ t ] o minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids ... each patient should be titrated to his/her lowest effective dose . '' It is undisputed that the FDA requires all manufacturers of inhaled corticosteroids such as budesonide to include this downward titration language in the labels of their inhaled corticosteroid products . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . Apotex 's ANDA _NEWLINE_ Apotex submitted an ANDA seeking FDA approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of budesonide for twice-daily use , a use not claimed in either the ¡¬603 or ¡¬099 patents . The ANDA included a proposed label for the generic drug that , with certain exceptions , is identical to the label included with AstraZeneca 's budesonide product . Specifically , in its label , Apotex replaced the `` PULMICORT RESPULES ( r ) '' brand name on AstraZeneca 's product with the generic name `` budesonide inhalation suspension . '' Apotex also submitted a section viii statement asserting that it was not seeking approval for the once-daily method of use claimed in the ¡¬603 and ¡¬099 patents and that its proposed generic label would contain no explicit mention of once-daily administration . However , the proposed label retained the FDA-mandated downward-titration language found in AstraZeneca 's PULMICORT RESPULES ( r ) product label . Apotex further represented that the proposed label would indicate that the generic drug is available in only two strengths : 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg per 2 mL vial . The FDA approved Apotex 's ANDA on March 30 , 2009 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ IV . Proceedings Before the District Court _NEWLINE_ On March 31 , 2009 , the day after Apotex 's ANDA was approved , AstraZeneca initiated the declaratory judgment action underlying this appeal and moved for a preliminary injunction barring Apotex from distributing its generic budesonide drug . In that action , AstraZeneca argued that Apotex would directly infringe certain kit claims in both patents ( claims 29 and 30 of the ¡¬603 Patent and claims 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 , and 24-27 of the ¡¬099 Patent ) and would induce infringement of specified method *1048 claims in the ¡¬603 Patent ( claims 1-3 , 6-8 , 11-18 , and 21-28 ) by including the downward-titration statements in the proposed label . AstraZeneca asserted that the downward-titration statements effectively instructed consumers to use the drug once daily . Claims 1 and 29 , respectively , are representative of the asserted method and kit claims in the ¡¬603 Patent : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A method of treating a patient suffering from a respiratory disease , the method comprising administering to the patient a nebulized dose of a budesonide composition in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬603 Patent col.10 ll.18-22 . _NEWLINE_ 29 . A kit for treating respiratory diseases , the kit comprising ( a ) a budesonide composition in a sealed container , the composition containing 0.05 mg to 15 mg budesonide and a solvent , and ( b ) a label indicating administration by nebulization in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day . _NEWLINE_ Id . col.12 ll.3-8 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 17 is representative of the asserted kit claims in the ¡¬099 Patent : _NEWLINE_ 17 . A kit for treating a respiratory disease , the kit comprising ( a ) a budesonide suspension in a sealed container , the suspension containing 0.05 mg to 15 mg budesonide and a solvent , and ( b ) a label indicating administration by nebulization in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬099 Patent col.11 ll.9-14 . _NEWLINE_ The court held a five-day hearing on AstraZeneca 's request for a preliminary injunction . At the hearing , Apotex argued that U.S. Patent No . 5,192,528 ( `` the ¡¬528 Patent '' ) anticipates all but three of the asserted method claims ( claims 12 , 14 , and 16 ) . Apotex also argued that a 1994 advertisement for AstraZeneca 's PULMICORT RESPULES ( r ) drug in the British medical journal Thorax ( `` the Thorax advertisement '' ) anticipates each of the asserted method claims . Apotex contended that the asserted kit claims of both patents were invalid because the claimed budesonide composition and suspension were known in the prior art and the recited label could not render a known product patentable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex further argued that it would not induce infringement of the asserted method claims . Apotex contended that the proposed label would not lead consumers to directly infringe the claims because the downward-titration statements included in the label did not instruct users to take the generic drug once daily . In support of this argument , Apotex pointed out that the FDA had previously issued a letter agreeing that the downward-titration language did not `` teach '' once-daily usage and was not protected by the ¡¬603 and ¡¬099 patents . Apotex also contended that it lacked the requisite specific intent to induce infringement because it was the FDA that had required Apotex to include the downward-titration statements in the label . Moreover , because the generic drug allegedly has substantial noninfringing uses ( e.g. , twice-daily administration to treat asthma ) , Apotex argued that the district court could not infer that Apotex intended to induce infringement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the first of two opinions , the district court agreed that Apotex had shown a likelihood of success in its contention that all of the asserted kit claims were invalid , concluding that the `` addition of the instruction does not functionally alter the known product so as to create a new patentable product . '' AstraZeneca LP v. Apotex , Inc. ( `` Opinion `` ) , 623 F.Supp.2d 579 , 591 ( D.N.J.2009 ) . With respect to the asserted method claims , the court determined that under its construction of the *1049 term `` budesonide composition '' Apotex had not shown the asserted method claims likely to be anticipated by the ¡¬528 Patent . Id . at 595 . The court likewise was not convinced that the Thorax advertisement anticipated these claims , finding persuasive evidence that one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would not have understood the advertisement to instruct once-daily usage of AstraZeneca 's PULMICORT RESPULES ( r ) drug . Id . at 596 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Regarding inducement , the district court concluded that the downward-titration language would lead many users to directly infringe the asserted method claims because titrating down from the recommended starting doses would necessarily lead to once-daily usage . Id . at 601-02 . The court found that the proposed label provided evidence of Apotex 's affirmative intent to induce infringement and that there was no evidence in the record that Apotex had attempted to craft a noninfringing label . Id . at 605 , 607 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court also found that AstraZeneca would suffer irreparable harm if the court did not issue a preliminary injunction , as the damage caused by layoffs and loss of consumer goodwill would be unquantifiable , and a confidential settlement agreement between AstraZeneca and Teva Pharmaceuticals ( `` Teva '' ) made determining economic harm speculative . Id . at 611-14 . The court found that the public interest did not favor either party . Id . at 614 . Before deciding whether to issue the requested preliminary injunction , the court offered Apotex the opportunity to present additional evidence addressing whether Apotex had the necessary specific intent to induce infringement of the asserted method claims . Apotex accepted and presented testimony regarding Apotex 's efforts to develop a non-infringing label . After considering this testimony , the court issued a supplemental opinion in which it concluded that AstraZeneca had shown that Apotex had the requisite specific intent to induce infringement . AstraZeneca LP v. Apotex , Inc. ( `` Supplemental Opinion `` ) , 623 F.Supp.2d 615 ( D.N.J.2009 ) . The district court then issued its preliminary injunction . Apotex filed a timely appeal and AstraZeneca timely filed a cross-appeal . This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . The Preliminary Injunction _NEWLINE_ This court reviews a decision to grant a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion . Abbott Labs . v. Sandoz , Inc. , 566 F.3d 1282 , 1298 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( citing Amazon.com , Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1343 , 1350 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ) . `` An abuse of discretion may be established by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings . '' Amazon.com , 239 F.3d at 1350 ( quoting Novo Nordisk of N . Am. , Inc. v. Genentech , Inc. , 77 F.3d 1364 , 1367 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that [ it ] is likely to succeed on the merits , that [ it ] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief , that the balance of equities tips in [ its ] favor , and that an injunction is in the public interest . '' Winter v. Natural Res . Def . Council , Inc. , 555 U.S. 7 , -- -- , 129 S.Ct . 365 , 374 , 172 L.Ed.2d 249 ( 2008 ) ; see also Titan Tire Corp. v. Case New Holland , Inc. , 566 F.3d 1372 , 1375 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . Apotex appeals only the district court 's findings that AstraZeneca is likely to succeed on the merits with respect to the asserted method claims and is likely to suffer irreparable *1050 harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . Likelihood of Success on the Merits _NEWLINE_ For a patentee to establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits , it `` must demonstrate that it will likely prove infringement of one or more claims of the patents-in-suit , and that at least one of those same allegedly infringed claims will also likely withstand the validity challenges presented by the accused infringer . '' Amazon.com , 239 F.3d at 1351 . When reviewing the grant of a preliminary injunction , this court `` views the matter in light of the burdens and presumptions that will inhere at trial . '' Titan Tire Corp. , 566 F.3d at 1376 ( citation omitted ) . A preliminary injunction should not issue if an alleged infringer raises a substantial question regarding either infringement or validity , i.e. , the alleged infringer asserts an infringement or invalidity defense that the patentee has not shown lacks substantial merit . Genentech , Inc. v. Novo Nordisk A/S , 108 F.3d 1361 , 1364 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex contends that AstraZeneca has failed on both validity and infringement . Regarding validity , Apotex repeats its argument that the ¡¬528 Patent and the Thorax advertisement anticipate the asserted method claims . With respect to infringement , Apotex renews its contention that the distribution of its generic version of AstraZeneca 's budesonide product would not induce infringement because such distribution fails to show that Apotex possessed the requisite specific intent to infringe . These contentions are addressed in turn . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ i . The ¡¬528 Patent _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬528 Patent , entitled `` Corticosteroid Inhalation Treatment Method , '' issued in 1993 , several years before the filing of the application that matured into the ¡¬603 Patent . The ¡¬528 Patent discloses a method for treating lung conditions such as asthma by administering a suspension of budesonide `` entrapped '' within a liposome ( i.e. , a spherical vesicle ) once daily . Col.7 ll.57-63 , col.8 ll.4-11 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Before addressing validity , the district court construed the term `` budesonide composition '' in the asserted method claims . The court concluded that the term means `` budesonide dispersed in a solvent in the form of a solution or suspension '' and excludes `` the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬ 528 Patent . '' Opinion at 595 . In support of this construction , the district court noted that the ¡¬603 Patent consistently describes the compositions used in the claimed method as either suspensions or solutions of budesonide dispersed in a solvent . Id . The court also cited the testimony of Dr. Robert O. Williams III , an expert witness presented by AstraZeneca . Dr. Williams testified that the ¡¬603 Patent discloses a `` depot effect '' associated with budesonide that enables the drug to be effective when administered only once per day . Prelim . Inj . Hr ' g Tr . 16-17 , May 4 , 2009 . Dr. Williams explained that the ¡¬603 Patent teaches dispersing budesonide in a solvent as either a solution ( i.e. , budesonide dissolved in the solvent ) or as a suspension ( i.e. , budesonide particles floating in the solvent ) . Id . at 16-19 . According to Dr. Williams , dispersing budesonide in the solvent in either form places the budesonide in direct contact with the solvent , which allows the budesonide to be absorbed by lung cells where the drug binds with fatty acids and is rendered inactive . Id . at 16-18 . This inactive budesonide acts as a `` depot '' or reservoir of budesonide that replaces free budesonide as the free budesonide is used . Id . at 16-17 . He explained that , unlike the liposome-entrapped budesonide disclosed *1051 in the ¡¬ 528 Patent , `` the budesonide is provided ... in ... immediate contact with the solvent [ ] such that ... the budesonide molecules ... are available to be absorbed by the airway cells ... and act as a depot effect . '' Id . at 26-27 . Dr. Williams testified that the ¡¬603 Patent `` tells one of skill in the art that it 's important to provide budesonide immediately in contact with the solvent either dissolved as a solution or suspended in a suspension '' and later opined that providing budesonide in direct contact with the solvent was critical to the depot effect . Id . at 17-18 . Based on the testimony of Dr. Williams , the court found that the `` 'depot effect ' is at the heart of AstraZeneca 's revolutionary method and it could not occur if the liposomes involved in the ¡¬528 Patent were present . '' Opinion at 595 . Accordingly , the district court concluded that the ¡¬528 Patent does not anticipate the asserted method claims because the patent does not disclose the claimed `` budesonide composition . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Apotex points out that the ¡¬603 Patent discloses budesonide formulations that include liposomes : `` [ T ] herapeutic suspensions can also contain one or more excipients . Excipients are well known in the art and include ... liposomes ... . Solutions or suspensions can be encapsulated in liposomes or biodegradable microspheres . '' ¡¬603 Patent col.3 ll.32-39 ( emphases added ) . Apotex argues that the district court improperly relied on expert testimony to arrive at a construction of `` budesonide composition '' that excludes these formulations , violating this court 's warnings that claims should generally not be interpreted in a manner that excludes embodiments disclosed in the specification . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response , AstraZeneca argues that the district court correctly construed the `` budesonide composition '' term based on the intrinsic evidence and expert testimony in the record . AstraZeneca contends that the district court 's reliance on the testimony of Dr. Williams was entirely proper , as his testimony simply explained the meaning of the term `` budesonide composition '' in the context of the ¡¬603 Patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is no serious dispute that the ¡¬528 Patent would anticipate the majority of the asserted method claims if the term `` budesonide composition '' is interpreted to include the liposome embodiments disclosed in the ¡¬528 Patent and would not anticipate the method claims if the district court 's construction was correct . Thus , the question before us is whether the district court correctly construed the term to exclude these embodiments . This court reviews the district court 's claim construction de novo . Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs. , Inc. , 138 F.3d 1448 , 1456 ( Fed.Cir.1998 ) ( en banc ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court agrees with AstraZeneca and concludes that the district court was correct in its claim construction . A claim term is generally given its `` ordinary and customary meaning , '' that is , `` the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention . '' Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1312-13 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( en banc ) . `` [ T ] he person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears , but in the context of the entire patent , including the specification . '' Id . at 1313 . `` [ T ] he specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess . In such cases , the inventor 's lexicography governs . '' Id . at 1316 . The specification need not reveal such a definition explicitly . See Bell Atl . Network Servs. , Inc. v. Covad Commc'ns Group , Inc. , 262 F.3d 1258 , 1268 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( `` [ A ] claim term may *1052 be clearly redefined without an explicit statement of redefinition. '' ) . `` [ W ] hen a patentee uses a claim term throughout the entire patent specification , in a manner consistent with only a single meaning , he has defined that term 'by implication . ' `` Id . at 1271 ( quoting Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic , Inc. , 90 F.3d 1576 , 1582 ( Fed.Cir.1996 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , the specification of the ¡¬603 Patent supports the conclusion that one of ordinary skill in the art would have understood the term `` budesonide composition '' to mean `` budesonide dispersed in a solvent in the form of a solution or suspension '' as construed by the district court . The specification consistently describes the budesonide compositions in that way . The SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION states that `` the invention features a method of treating a patient suffering from a respiratory disease in which a composition , e.g. , a suspension , of budesonide is administered by nebulization , '' ¡¬603 Patent col.1 ll.29-31 , and explains a few sentences later that `` [ t ] he drug can be provided as an aqueous suspension in which the budesonide is suspended in a solvent , '' id . col.1 ll.37-39 . The SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION notes that `` the invention also features a kit ... including a budesonide composition in a sealed container , the composition including 0.05 mg to 15 mg budesonide and a solvent . '' Id . col.2 ll.1-6 . Similarly , the DETAILED DESCRIPTION states that `` [ t ] he drug can be delivered in a solvent , e.g. , in the form of a solution or a suspension . '' Id . col.3 ll.22-23 . The DETAILED DESCRIPTION goes on to note that nebulizable budesonide is packaged in vials containing `` micronized budesonide suspended in a volume , e.g. , 2 ml , of solvent . '' Id . col.4 ll.12-14 . The EXAMPLES section describes two clinical studies performed to determine the safety and efficacy of administering budesonide once daily . The patent discloses that in each study `` [ b ] udesonide was administered once per day as a nebulized suspension . '' Id . col.4 ll.65-67 , col.7 ll.57-60 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As noted above , the specification does mention liposome formulations in two places . Id . col.3 ll.32-39 ( `` [ T ] herapeutic suspensions can also contain one or more excipients . Excipients are well known in the art and include ... liposomes ... . Solutions or suspensions can be encapsulated in liposomes or biodegradable micro-spheres . '' ( emphases added ) ) . Contrary to Apotex 's contention , however , the district court 's construction does not exclude either of these formulations . The district court 's construction excludes `` the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬528 Patent . '' Neither of the liposome formulations discussed in the specification use liposomes in the manner described in the ¡¬528 Patent . The ¡¬528 Patent describes entrapping budesonide in a liposome . Such entrapment separates the budesonide from the surrounding solvent . By contrast , the reference in the specification to placing liposomes in a suspension as an excipient indicates a formulation where budesonide and liposomes are in the same suspension , with the liposomes independent of and apart from the budesonide , which remains in contact with the solvent . The statement that `` [ s ] olutions or suspensions can be encapsulated in liposomes or biodegradable microspheres '' indicates that budesonide either dissolved or floating in a solvent may be placed within a liposome , not that the term `` budesonide composition '' includes budesonide separated from a solvent by a liposome as described in the ¡¬528 Patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The specification and the claims are not the only sources that a court may consider when determining the meaning of a claim term . A court may look to `` those sources available to the public that show *1053 what a person of skill in the art would have understood disputed claim language to mean , '' which , in addition to the claims and the rest of the specification , may include `` the prosecution history [ ] and extrinsic evidence concerning relevant scientific principles , the meaning of technical terms , and the state of the art . '' Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1314 ( quoting Innova/Pure Water , Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Sys. , Inc. , 381 F.3d 1111 , 1116 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) ) . Extrinsic evidence `` consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history , including expert and inventor testimony , dictionaries , and learned treatises . '' Id . at 1317 ( quoting Markman v. Westview Instruments , Inc. , 52 F.3d 967 , 980 ( Fed.Cir.1995 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , the record includes the testimony of AstraZeneca 's expert , Dr. Williams . This court generally views expert testimony `` as less reliable than the patent and its prosecution history in determining how to read claim terms . '' Id . at 1318 . However , expert testimony can be useful `` for a variety of purposes , such as to provide background on the technology at issue , to explain how an invention works , [ or ] to ensure that the court 's understanding of the technical aspects of the patent is consistent with that of a person of skill in the art ... . '' Id . at 1318 . In this case , the district court properly relied on the testimony of Dr. Williams to understand how the claimed invention works and construed the disputed term in a manner consistent with that understanding . As described above , Dr. Williams explained that the ¡¬ 603 Patent discloses that the depot effect permits budesonide to be effective when administered once daily and opined that for the depot effect to occur budesonide must be in direct contact with the solvent . He also testified that one of skill in the art would have understood the ¡¬603 Patent to disclose budesonide in immediate contact with the solvent as either a solution or suspension . This would exclude the liposome-entrapped embodiments disclosed in the ¡¬528 Patent . Although Apotex takes issue with the district court 's reliance on Dr. Williams 's testimony , Apotex does not seriously dispute his explanation of how the claimed invention works and provided no testimony to the contrary at the preliminary injunction hearing . This court sees no error in relying on uncontested expert testimony to explain how the invention described in the intrinsic record functions . See Netword , LLC v. Centraal Corp. , 242 F.3d 1347 , 1356 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) ( `` [ A ] district court can not be faulted for relying on the only expert explanation of the technology that was presented. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Considered together , the intrinsic evidence and expert testimony support the conclusion that a person skilled in the art would have understood the term `` budesonide composition '' to mean `` budesonide dispersed in a solvent in the form of a solution or suspension '' and excludes `` the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬528 Patent . `` 1 Accordingly , this court *1054 concludes that , based on the evidence of record at this point , the district court correctly construed this term , and thus correctly found that the asserted method claims are likely to withstand the validity challenge posed by the ¡¬528 Patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ii . The Thorax Advertisement _NEWLINE_ As discussed above , a British medical journal published the Thorax advertisement in 1994 , more than one year before the filing of the application that issued as the ¡¬603 Patent . The advertisement touts AstraZeneca 's PULMICORT RESPULES ( r ) drug as `` [ a ] high-dose nebulised steroid that 's low on side effects '' and notes that the drug can be used to treat bronchial asthma in children . The advertisement indicates that the drug was available in 2 mL single dose vials , each vial containing either 0.25 mg/mL or 0.5 mg/mL of budesonide . The advertisement includes the following statement regarding dosing : _NEWLINE_ Initially ... the recommended dose in adults ... is usually 1-2 mg twice daily ... . Children ... 0.5-1 mg twice daily . The maintenance dose should be the lowest dose which keeps the patient symptom-free . Recommended doses are Adults ... 0.5-1 mg twice daily . Children ... 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily . _NEWLINE_ When the advertisement was published , AstraZeneca 's budesonide product was not approved for any use in the United States and was approved for only twice-daily use in Europe . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because it is undisputed that the asserted method claims cover the use of budesonide solution , the only question before the district court was whether the advertisement disclosed administering that solution `` in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day '' as recited in the claims . The district court found that the advertisement does not anticipate the asserted method claims , finding persuasive the explanation of AstraZeneca 's expert , Dr. Bradley Chipps , that the advertisement does not explicitly or inherently disclose once-daily dosing because the advertisement was published `` before we had any information or historical perspective that once a day therapy worked for anyone . '' Opinion at 596 . The district court reached that conclusion with the understanding of Dr. Chipps , who also testified that , if made today , the statement `` [ t ] he maintenance dose should be the lowest dose which keeps the patient symptom-free '' would be equivalent to the downward-titration language included in the proposed label that AstraZeneca claimed would induce infringement of the asserted method claims . Prelim . Inj . Hr ' g Tr . 186 , May 4 , 2009 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On appeal , Apotex asserts that if the language in the Thorax advertisement would today suggest to those in the art the possibility of administering the drug once daily , it would also have suggested this possibility when the advertisement was published , regardless of whether anyone had proven that the drug could be effective when administered once per day . Apotex argues that in concluding otherwise the district court improperly imposed a temporal limitation on the anticipation inquiry , violating the oft-repeated axiom `` that which would literally infringe if later in time anticipates if earlier . '' AstraZeneca responds that because the drug was only approved for twice-daily use and was not known to be safe or effective when administered once daily , there is nothing to show that one of skill in the art at the time the *1055 patent application was filed would have understood the advertisement to disclose once-daily dosing . AstraZeneca thus argues that the Thorax advertisement was not enabling and for that reason can not be considered anticipatory . In any event , AstraZeneca argues that the reference simply does not disclose once-daily dosing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Anticipation is a question of fact , Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex , Inc. , 550 F.3d 1075 , 1082 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( citation omitted ) , that must be established at trial by clear and convincing evidence , Purdue Pharma L.P. v. Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH , 237 F.3d 1359 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . This court reviews for clear error the district court 's determination that AstraZeneca has demonstrated that the asserted method claims will likely survive the validity challenge posed by the Thorax advertisement . See Amazon.com , 239 F.3d at 1350 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ While the question is close , this court agrees with AstraZeneca that the district court correctly determined that AstraZeneca has demonstrated that the asserted method claims will likely withstand the validity challenge presented by the Thorax advertisement . In the context of anticipation , the question is not whether a prior art reference `` suggests '' the claimed subject matter as posited by Apotex . Rather , `` the dispositive question regarding anticipation [ is ] whether one skilled in the art would reasonably understand or infer from a [ prior art reference ] '' that every claim element is disclosed in that reference . In re Baxter Travenol Labs. , 952 F.2d 388 , 390 ( Fed.Cir.1991 ) . And although a reference must be enabling to be anticipatory , see Sanofi-Synthelabo , 550 F.3d at 1082 , unlike enablement under ¡± 112 , a reference need not , as AstraZeneca suggests , demonstrate utility or efficacy to be enabling in the context of ¡± 102 , see In re Gleave , 560 F.3d 1331 , 1335-36 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( `` [ A ] reference need disclose no independent use or utility to anticipate a claim under ¡± 102 . `` ) ; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Labs. , Inc. , 246 F.3d 1368 , 1379 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . As explained in Rasmusson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp. , 413 F.3d 1318 , 1325 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) , the reason for this distinction `` is that [ ¡± ] 112 'provides that the specification must enable one skilled in the art to 'use ' the invention whereas [ ¡± ] 102 makes no such requirement as to an anticipatory disclosure . ' `` Id . ( quoting In re Hafner , 56 C.C.P.A . 1424 , 410 F.2d 1403 , 1405 ( CCPA 1969 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex 's argument that the Thorax advertisement is anticipatory because the advertisement and the proposed label are essentially the same ignores a key difference between the advertisement and the proposed label . As discussed in greater detail in the next section , depending on a patient 's previous therapy , the proposed label recommends initially administering 0.25 mg of budesonide twice daily . The district court concluded that the proposed label would induce infringement because , absent instructions to the contrary , titrating down to the lowest effective dose from the recommended starting dose of 0.25 mg of budesonide twice daily would necessarily lead some users to take 0.25 mg of budesonide once daily as a maintenance dose , as there would be no way to properly administer less than 0.25 mg of the drug . By contrast , the Thorax advertisement explicitly discloses that such maintenance doses should be administered twice daily . Immediately after the advertisement warns that `` [ t ] he maintenance dose should be the lowest dose which keeps the patient symptom-free , '' the advertisement sets out recommended doses for adults and children : 0.5-1 mg twice daily for adults , and 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily for children . The most natural reading of this passage is *1056 that the recommended doses are recommended maintenance doses , which the advertisement explicitly states should be administered twice daily . Thus , although Dr. Chipps testified that the statement `` [ t ] he maintenance dose should be the lowest dose which keeps the patient symptom-free '' would , if made today , be equivalent to the downward-titration language included in the proposed label , the advertisement-unlike the proposed label-clearly states how often a maintenance dose should be given : twice per day . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Dr. Chipps confirmed that one of ordinary skill in the art would have understood the advertisement to disclose administering budesonide twice-daily , not once per day as argued by Apotex . He testified that `` there 's nothing in [ the Thorax advertisement ] that talks about or alludes to once a day dosage , '' and noted that the advertisement instructs that the recommended starting and maintenance doses are to be administered twice daily . Prelim . Inj . Hr ' g Tr . 144 , May 4 , 2009 . Dr. Chipps opined that when the Thorax advertisement was published in 1994 a physician reading the dosing recommendations set forth in the advertisement would not have understood the dosing recommendations to teach once-daily dosing . Id . at 144 . He explained that until AstraZeneca conducted clinical studies on its budesonide product in 1997 there was no evidence that administering budesonide once-daily would be safe and effective . Indeed , he noted that prior to 1997 , the lowest dose of budesonide known to be effective was 0.25 mg taken twice a day . Id . at 147-48 . Apotex presented no testimony or evidence to the contrary . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After considering the reference and appreciating how that reference would have been understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art at that time , this court is not left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court clearly erred by concluding that at trial Apotex will likely not be able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the Thorax advertisement anticipates the asserted method claims.2 Accordingly , the district court 's determination is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ iii . Inducement _NEWLINE_ `` Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 271 ( b ) . `` [ I ] nducement requires that the alleged infringer knowingly induced infringement and possessed specific intent to encourage another 's infringement . '' DSU Med . Corp. v. JMS Co. , 471 F.3d 1293 , 1306 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( en banc in relevant part ) ( citation omitted ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . `` Infringement is a question of fact reviewed for clear error . '' Golden Blount , Inc. v. Robert H. Peterson , Co. , 438 F.3d 1354 , 1361 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ( citation omitted ) . `` A factual finding is clearly erroneous when , despite some supporting evidence , the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made . '' Id . at 1361 ( citation omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1057 Before the district court , AstraZeneca contended that Apotex 's proposed label would induce consumers to infringe the asserted method claims because the label implicitly instructed users to administer the generic drug once daily . As in AstraZeneca 's PULMICORT RESPULES ( r ) drug label , the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section of the proposed generic label explains that `` [ i ] n all patients , it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved . '' The section also includes the following table of recommended starting doses and highest recommended doses , which differs from AstraZeneca 's label in the removal of all mention of once-daily dosing : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Previous Therapy _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Recommended Starting Dose _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Highest Recommended Dose _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Bronchodilators _NEWLINE_ alone _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 0.5 mg total daily dose _NEWLINE_ administered twice daily in divided doses _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 0.5 mg total daily dose _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Inhaled _NEWLINE_ Corticosteroids _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 0.5 mg total daily dose _NEWLINE_ administered twice daily in divided doses _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 mg total _NEWLINE_ daily dose _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Oral _NEWLINE_ Corticosteroids _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 mg total _NEWLINE_ daily dose _NEWLINE_ administered as 0.5 mg twice daily _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 mg total _NEWLINE_ daily dose _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the paragraph following the table , the label again warns that `` [ o ] nce the desired clinical effect is achieved , consideration should be given to tapering to the lowest effective dose . '' _NEWLINE_ The district court agreed with AstraZeneca that the proposed label would cause some users to infringe the asserted method claims . The proposed label indicates that the generic drug will be available in only two strengths : 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg per 2 mL vial . The court noted that , once opened , each vial of the generic drug must immediately be administered in its entirety because dividing the contents of a vial for use at different times would compromise the drug 's sterility . Opinion at 600 n. 17 . Because the recommended starting dose for patients in the first two rows of the dosing table is `` 0.5 mg total daily dose administered twice daily in divided doses '' ( i.e. , 0.25 mg administered twice a day ) , the court reasoned that the first step in titrating down from this dose would have to be 0.25 mg once daily , as there was no way of decreasing the amount of each dose below 0.25 mg. Id . at 602 . Accordingly , the court concluded that , for patients whose previous treatments fell within the first two rows of the dosage table , the downward-titration language would necessarily lead patients to use a 0.25 mg vial of the drug once-daily . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court found that a letter issued by the FDA supported this conclusion . In 2008 , AstraZeneca filed a citizen petition with the FDA concerning an ANDA submitted by IVAX Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ( `` IVAX '' ) that is virtually identical to the ANDA submitted by Apotex . In the petition , AstraZeneca asked the FDA to determine that labeling for a generic budesonide inhalation suspension must include once-daily dosing language . AstraZeneca also questioned the propriety of including downward-titration language in a proposed label for a generic budesonide inhalation suspension . In response , the FDA issued a letter explaining that the labeling for a generic budesonide inhalation suspension could omit references to once-daily dosing `` [ b ] ecause the weight of the evidence is stronger in support of efficacy for twice-daily dosing as opposed to once-daily dosing ... omission of once-daily dosing in the generic BIS labeling would not render the generic drug less safe or effective than PULMICORT RESPULES ( r ) . '' Letter from the FDA to AstraZeneca 16 ( Nov. 18 , 2008 ) . The letter *1058 also stated that the FDA found it appropriate to include the downward-titration language in proposed labeling for generic budesonide inhalation suspensions because the FDA believed that the language did not `` teach '' once-daily dosing : _NEWLINE_ Titration to the lowest effective dose may involve , for example , a twice-daily regimen , once-daily dosing , or even alternate day dosing ... . The labeling does not state the lowest effective dose is 0.25 mg once daily . As such , contrary to your assertion , the downward titration statement does not `` teach '' once-daily dosing . _NEWLINE_ ... . _NEWLINE_ ... . The downward titration statement does not specify or instruct that the dosing frequency must be once daily and need not be carved out as protected by the 6,598,603 and 6,899,099 patents . _NEWLINE_ Id . at 18 . The district court concluded that the letter supported the court 's finding of direct infringement because the letter explicitly stated ( and therefore put Apotex on notice ) that downward titration may involve once-daily dosing . Opinion at 601 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Regarding specific intent to induce infringement , the district court found that AstraZeneca had submitted evidence of Apotex 's affirmative intent that consumers use the generic drug in an infringing manner : Apotex 's inclusion of the downward-titration language in the proposed label . Id . at 605 . The court also noted that Apotex had presented no evidence that the company had attempted to draft a non-infringing label . Id . at 606-07 . Because the question of Apotex 's efforts to draft a non-infringing label had arisen late in the proceedings , the court offered Apotex the opportunity to continue the hearing and present evidence on this issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex accepted the court 's offer and presented Bernice Tau , the Director of Regulatory Affairs at Apotex , to testify at the hearing . Tau testified that , in addition to removing all explicit references to once-daily dosing , at the advice of counsel , Apotex had also inserted the phrase `` by administration twice-daily '' in sections of the proposed label that Apotex included with its ANDA . Prelim . Inj . Hr ' g Tr . 19 , 21-22 , May 20 , 2009 . She explained that the FDA responded by instructing Apotex to delete this phrase and sending Apotex a template containing the language Apotex was to include in the proposed label . Id . at 22-23 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Tau stated that Apotex never intended to instruct or encourage either physicians or patients to use its generic drug once-daily . Id . at 32 . She also testified that it never occurred to Apotex that the downward-titration statements in the proposed label would suggest once-daily use of Apotex 's generic version of the drug . Id . at 27 . She explained that she became aware that the language was problematic after Apotex obtained approval of its ANDA , when Apotex 's counsel notified her that AstraZeneca was objecting to use of the language . Id . at 27 , 37 . She stated that after learning of the issue , she made two calls to the FDA to address AstraZeneca 's concerns and proposed the following three amendments to the label : ( 1 ) adding the words `` twice daily '' to the downward-titration language ; ( 2 ) adding language stating the drug is not approved for less than twice-daily use ; and ( 3 ) removing the downward-titration language . Id . at 27-31 . She testified that she did so despite believing , based on her experience with the FDA , that the FDA would not allow Apotex to alter the label . Id . at 27-28 . She stated that during these calls the FDA informed her of the letter it issued in response to AstraZeneca 's petition . Id . at 37-38 . As she expected , the FDA did not permit Apotex to make any of the suggested *1059 changes . She explained that Apotex did not submit a formal labeling amendment because , based on her conversations with the FDA , she believed doing so would have been futile . Id . at 33-34 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Tau acknowledged that she knew that FDA decisions could be appealed , but stated that she was not familiar with the process , as she had never had to appeal an FDA decision regarding an ANDA . Id . at 37 , 40 . Tau also admitted that had Apotex wanted to seek approval to distribute a different strength of the generic drug , Apotex could have submitted a suitability petition , but she explained that she thought this was unnecessary because Apotex 's ANDA satisfied all of the applicable requirements . Id . at 11-12 , 52-53 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Based on the evidence presented on the hearing , the district court found that Apotex `` was aware of and certainly concerned about the potential infringement problem posed by its label , '' but nevertheless decided to proceed with the label . Opinion at 618 . The district court noted that Apotex had other options at its disposal that it chose not to pursue . The court pointed out that Apotex could have formally appealed the FDA 's decision . Id . The court also noted that Apotex could have filed a suitability petition or a paper NDA that sought approval to produce the generic drug at a strength of 0.125 mg per 2 mL . At that strength , AstraZeneca conceded that the downward-titration language would not teach an infringing use . Id . at 619 & n. 3 . The court found that this conduct showed that Apotex had the requisite specific intent to induce infringement and granted AstraZeneca 's request for a preliminary injunction . Id . at 618-19 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex , joined by two amici , mounts multiple challenges to the district court 's finding that Apotex had the necessary specific intent to induce infringement . Apotex first contends that the district court inferred specific intent to induce infringement from Apotex 's planned distribution of the generic drug . Apotex argues that drawing such an inference is improper where the product in question has substantial non-infringing uses . AstraZeneca responds that the district court based its specific intent finding not on an improper inference but rather on the circumstances surrounding Apotex 's decision to proceed with its planned distribution of the generic drug and the affirmative evidence of intent provided by the proposed label . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court agrees with AstraZeneca . Apotex is correct that `` where a product has substantial noninfringing uses , intent to induce infringement can not be inferred even when the [ alleged inducer ] has actual knowledge that some users of its product may be infringing the patent . '' Warner-Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp. , 316 F.3d 1348 , 1365 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . However , `` liability for active inducement may be found 'where evidence goes beyond a product 's characteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses , and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement . ' `` Ricoh Co. v. Quanta Computer Inc. , 550 F.3d 1325 , 1341 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( quoting Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster , Ltd. ( `` Grokster `` ) , 545 U.S. 913 , 935 , 125 S.Ct . 2764 , 162 L.Ed.2d 781 ( 2005 ) ) . As the Supreme Court explained in Grokster in the context of infringement under the copyright laws , `` [ e ] vidence of active steps ... taken to encourage direct infringement , such as advertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use , show an affirmative intent that the product be used to infringe . '' 545 U.S. at 936 , 125 S.Ct . 2764 ( internal quotation marks and citations omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court correctly concluded that such evidence exists here . As an initial matter , the district court suggested *1060 that there was insufficient evidence to establish that any noninfringing use of the generic drug was substantial , calling into question the applicability of the `` substantial non-infringing use '' doctrine in this case . Opinion at 605 n. 25 . Be that as it may , the district court found that Apotex had the requisite specific intent to induce infringement because Apotex included instructions in its proposed label that will cause at least some users to infringe the asserted method claims . Id . at 605 . The district court also found that , despite being aware of the infringement problem presented by the proposed label , Apotex nonetheless proceeded with its plans to distribute its generic drug product . Supplemental Opinion at 618 . This conduct , not merely the planned distribution of the generic drug , formed the basis of the district court 's specific intent finding . See id . at 618-19 . To the extent that Apotex contends that such circumstantial evidence can not support a finding of specific intent , this court has explicitly stated otherwise . Water Techs . Corp. v. Calco , Ltd. , 850 F.2d 660 , 668 ( Fed.Cir.1988 ) ( `` While proof of intent is necessary , direct evidence is not required ; rather , circumstantial evidence may suffice . '' ( citation omitted ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex next contends that the proposed label is not evidence of specific intent because warnings on drug labels do not influence how a drug is used . Apotex further argues that even if labels did affect how drugs are used , the district court erroneously determined that the downward-titration language would lead the generic drug to be used in an infringing manner . Apotex asserts that the label does not instruct users to titrate down from a specific starting dose ; instead , the label contains a general recommendation that is applicable to any dosing regimen . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court disagrees . In the context of specific intent , it is irrelevant that some users may ignore the warnings in the proposed label . The pertinent question is whether the proposed label instructs users to perform the patented method . If so , the proposed label may provide evidence of Apotex 's affirmative intent to induce infringement . See Vita-Mix Corp. v. Basic Holding , Inc. , 581 F.3d 1317 , 1329 n. 2 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( `` The question is not ... whether a user following the instructions may end up using the device in an infringing way . Rather , it is whether [ the ] instructions teach an infringing use of the device such that we are willing to infer from those instructions an affirmative intent to infringe the patent. '' ) . Even if Apotex were correct that the downward-titration language may be applied to other dosing regimens , the language is still applicable to the recommended starting doses and , as correctly determined by the district court , would inevitably lead some consumers to practice the claimed method . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex and the amici also argue that the proposed label alone is not sufficient evidence of specific intent because the FDA required Apotex to include the downward-titration language in the label and stated that the language does not teach the patented method . Apotex asserts that it agrees with the FDA and has never believed that the downward-titration language teaches the claimed once-daily method of administration . In response , AstraZeneca contends that Apotex 's compliance with FDA requirements and agreement with the FDA 's opinion regarding the downward-titration is immaterial . AstraZeneca argues that if Apotex could not create a noninfringing label , Apotex should have waited for the ¡¬603 Patent to expire before attempting to market its generic drug . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court again agrees with AstraZeneca . As explained above , the district court 's specific intent finding was not *1061 based solely on the proposed label , but also on Apotex 's decision to proceed with its plan to distribute the drug despite being aware that the label presented infringement problems . Apotex and the amici make much of the Hobson 's choice they contend that Apotex faced : either comply with FDA requirements and risk a patent infringement suit or remove the downward-titration language and ensure that the ANDA would not be approved . This court sees no such dilemma . Apotex was free to submit a Paragraph III certification and wait until the patents expired before distributing its generic drug or file a Paragraph IV certification and challenge infringement and validity of the asserted claims . Or , as observed by the district court , Apotex could have formally appealed the FDA 's denial of Apotex 's proposed labeling amendments or filed either a suitability petition or a paper NDA seeking approval for a 0.125 mg per 2 mL strength of the drug . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex 's reliance on the FDA 's statements that the downward-titration language does not `` teach '' once-daily dosing and is not protected by the ¡¬603 and ¡¬099 patents is misplaced . As acknowledged by both the parties and the district court , the FDA is not the arbiter of patent infringement issues . See Applications for FDA Approval To Market a New Drug : Patent Submission and Listing Requirements and Application of 30-Month Stays on Approval of Abbreviated New Drug Applications Certifying That a Patent Claiming a Drug Is Invalid or Will Not Be Infringed , Fed.Reg . 36,676 , 36,683 ( June 18 , 2003 ) ( `` [ W ] e lack expertise in patent matters . An administrative process for reviewing patents , assessing patent challenges , and de-listing patents would involve patent law issues that are outside both our expertise and our authority. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In light of the evidence presented to the district court , this court is not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made . Thus , this court affirms the district court 's finding that AstraZeneca will likely prove induced infringement at trial . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B. Irreparable Harm _NEWLINE_ The district court found that AstraZeneca would suffer three types of irreparable harm if the court did not grant the requested preliminary injunction . First , the court determined that a confidential settlement agreement between AstraZeneca and Teva would make calculating the economic harm from a premature launch of Apotex 's generic budesonide impossible . Second , the court concluded that AstraZeneca would incur unquantifiable damage to its reputation and goodwill if Apotex were allowed to launch its generic drug and was subsequently forced to remove the drug from the market . Third , the court found that the damage caused by layoffs stemming from entry of the generic drug into the market would also be significant and unquantifiable . Apotex challenges each of these findings , and each finding is considered in turn . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ i . The Settlement Agreement _NEWLINE_ On November 18 , 2008 , Teva received FDA approval to distribute a generic version of AstraZeneca 's budesonide drug and immediately began its distribution . Later that day , AstraZeneca initiated a patent infringement suit in the district court against Teva and successfully moved the court for a temporary restraining order enjoining Teva from selling the generic drug . AstraZeneca and Teva subsequently entered into a settlement agreement that granted Teva an exclusive license to sell its generic drug beginning December 15 , 2009 , with Teva agreeing to pay AstraZeneca *1062 a significant royalty . The agreement also included a `` step down '' provision that reduced the amount Teva was obligated to pay AstraZeneca if unlicensed drug manufacturers launched generic versions of the drug and certain conditions were met . In addition , Teva agreed to pay AstraZeneca a specified amount for damages caused by Teva 's unauthorized launch of its generic drug . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court observed that under the settlement agreement AstraZeneca would continue to have market exclusivity until December 15 , 2009 , and that after that date AstraZeneca and Teva would share the market . Based on expert testimony , the court concluded that to reliably calculate the economic harm AstraZeneca would suffer after December 15 , 2009 , the court would need data reflecting a market including only AstraZeneca and Teva . Because Apotex 's planned launch would prevent a market with only AstraZeneca and Teva from ever occurring , the district court determined that it would be `` complete speculation to put a number on what this market would have been worth to AstraZeneca . '' Opinion at 611 . The court dismissed Apotex 's argument that `` the parties expectations when they entered into the licensing agreement '' would be sufficient to calculate damages , explaining that `` there is a distinction between what the parties expect and what actually would have occurred '' and concluding that it would be impossible to calculate with reasonable certainty the economic damage that AstraZeneca would suffer under the settlement agreement if Apotex began distributing its generic drug . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex argues on appeal that testimony during the hearing established that during the settlement negotiations AstraZeneca and Teva had estimated the required market data . Because this information would be subject to discovery , Apotex contends that district court clearly erred when the court concluded that the damages AstraZeneca would suffer would be incalculable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In response , AstraZeneca suggests that the data generated during the settlement negotiations was influenced by the relative bargaining power of the parties and is not an accurate reflection of a market with only AstraZeneca and Teva . AstraZeneca argues that without the benefit of actual data from such a market , any damages calculation would be based on speculation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court agrees with AstraZeneca . Both AstraZeneca and Apotex rely on the testimony of Richard Fante , the president of AstraZeneca . Fante admitted that AstraZeneca and Teva did forecast certain market data during the settlement negotiation , but characterized the negotiation as a `` gun-to-head moment '' and explained that the companies relied mostly on `` the experience we 'd had as executives '' when generating the forecast . Prelim . Inj . Hr ' g Tr . 63-64 , Apr . 30 , 2009 . Given the lack of reliable data regarding a market with only AstraZeneca and Teva , this court is not left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court erred by concluding that the damages AstraZeneca would incur under the settlement agreement would be incalculable . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ii . Goodwill _NEWLINE_ The district court found that if Apotex began distributing its generic drug and was subsequently forced to remove the drug from the market , the resulting confusion among physicians and patients , as well as price changes , would cause unquantifiable harm to AstraZeneca 's goodwill . Apotex asserts that this finding is speculative , as certain provisions of the settlement agreement would mitigate , if not eliminate , any adverse effects of Apotex launching and then removing its generic drug from the market . Although this court agrees *1063 with Apotex that there has not been a particularly strong showing regarding this finding , after reviewing the record , this court concludes that the district court did not clearly err by determining that AstraZeneca will suffer incalculable harm to its goodwill . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ iii . Layoffs _NEWLINE_ Based on the testimony of Fante , the district court concluded that AstraZeneca would have to lay off some of its employees if Apotex launched its generic drug and the resulting noneconomic loss would be significant and unquantifiable . Opinion at 612 . The parties ' dispute regarding this finding largely concerns whether Fante testified that he would have to lay off employees if Apotex launched its generic drug or merely testified that layoffs might occur in that situation . Apotex points out that when asked whether Apotex 's entry would force him to lay off employees at AstraZeneca 's manufacturing facility , Fante responded , `` It could . '' Prelim . Inj . Hr ' g Tr . 100 , Apr . 30 , 2009 . However , as noted by AstraZeneca , Fante later clarified that if Apotex and Teva were both in the market that `` in that scenario we would have to have a layoff [ in the manufacturing facility ] . '' Id . Moreover , when asked what effect Apotex 's launch would have on AstraZeneca employees , Fante explained that `` [ u ] ndoubtedly ... I would have to have a further reduction in the size of the U.S . workforce . '' Id . at 47 . Similarly , when asked whether this reduction would occur if Apotex launched its product after December 15 , he stated , `` Absolutely . '' Id . Given this undisputed testimony , this court discerns no clear error in the district court 's finding . This court has reviewed the other arguments raised by Apotex concerning this finding and conclude that they too lack merit . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because Apotex has not demonstrated that any of the district court 's findings regarding irreparable harm are clearly erroneous , this court sees no reason to disturb the district court 's determination that AstraZeneca would suffer irreparable harm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . The Kit Claims _NEWLINE_ The asserted kit claims recite two elements : ( 1 ) a budesonide composition or suspension in a sealed container containing 0.05 mg to 15 mg budesonide and a solvent , and ( 2 ) a label indicating administration by nebulization in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day . See , e.g. , ¡¬603 Patent col.12 ll.3-8 ; ¡¬099 Patent col.11 ll.9-14 . The district court concluded that the kit claims are invalid , finding the claimed budesonide composition and suspension were known in the prior art and that the instructions in the claimed label are non-statutory subject matter and therefore not entitled to patentable weight . Opinion at 589-92 . Regarding the instructions in the label , the district court explained that under Federal Circuit precedent `` [ w ] here ... printed matter is not functionally related to the substrate , the printed matter will not distinguish the invention from the prior art in terms of patentability . '' Id . at 590 ( citation omitted ) . This court noted that here the parties disputed what constitutes the substrate , with Apotex contending that the label is the substrate and AstraZeneca asserting that the substrate is the drug . Id . at 592 . After considering our precedent , the district court concluded that this dispute was immaterial because regardless of how the substrate was defined , `` the instructions simply explain how to use the known product . This type of relationship does not qualify as a functional one ... . '' Id . at 591 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1064 AstraZeneca argues that a drug label and its associated drug are `` inextricably interrelated , '' as a drug can not be approved unless and until the FDA approves its label . AstraZeneca notes that FDA regulations require the label for a drug to include information needed for proper use of the drug and argues that without the label a physician would be unable to safely and effectively treat patients . In light of this , AstraZeneca contends that a drug label is essential to physicians when prescribing a drug and , therefore , is functionally related to the drug . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex counters that , for the purposes of determining whether the claimed label is entitled to patentable weight , the relationship between the drug and the label is irrelevant . According to Apotex , the proper inquiry is whether there is a functional relationship between the printed matter and its substrate , i.e. , the object the printed matter is printed on . Apotex contends that here the printed matter is the instruction for once-daily use and the substrate is the paper label . Citing In re Ngai , 367 F.3d 1336 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) , Apotex argues that the instructions are not functionally related to the label on which they are printed because they do not function together in any way . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ There is no dispute that the budesonide suspension recited in the claims is known in the prior art . The question before us is whether the district court correctly determined that the recitation in the claims of a label instructing not more than once-a-day dosing is of no patentable consequence . This court reviews de novo the district court 's determination that the asserted claims recite non-statutory subject matter . See In re Comiskey , 554 F.3d 967 , 975 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( explaining that `` whether the asserted claims ... are invalid for failure to claim statutory subject matter under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 101 [ ] is a question of law which we review without deference . '' ( quoting AT & T Corp. v. Excel Commc'ns , Inc. , 172 F.3d 1352 , 1355 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The categories of patentable subject matter are set forth in 35 U.S.C . ¡± 101 : _NEWLINE_ Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , or any new and useful improvement thereof , may obtain a patent therefor , subject to the conditions and requirements of this title . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court has generally found printed matter to fall outside the scope of ¡± 101 . See In re Chatfield , 545 F.2d 152 , 157 ( CCPA 1976 ) ( `` Some inventions , however meritorious , do not constitute patentable subject matter , e.g. , printed matter ... . '' ( citation omitted ) ) . However , as observed by the district court , this court has long recognized an exception to this general rule : If there is a `` functional relationship '' between the printed matter and its substrate , the printed matter may serve to distinguish the invention from the prior art . See In re Miller , 57 C.C.P.A . 809 , 418 F.2d 1392 , 1396 ( CCPA 1969 ) ; In re Gulack , 703 F.2d 1381 , 1385-87 ( Fed.Cir.1983 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court considered the printed matter exception in Ngai , a case similar to the one now before us . In Ngai , the Board affirmed the rejection of a claim reciting a kit comprising instructions to amplify ribonucleic acids . The Board found that the only difference between the claimed kit and the prior art was the content of the claimed instructions . Concluding that this content was not functionally related to the kit , the Board found that the claim was anticipated by the prior art . This court affirmed , rejecting the argument that the addition of new printed matter to a known product makes the product patentable . This court reasoned that `` the printed matter in no way depends on the kit , and the *1065 kit does not depend on the printed matter . All that the printed matter does is teach a new use for an existing product . '' Ngai , 367 F.3d at 1339 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court agrees with Apotex that as in Ngai the claimed instructions here are not entitled to patentable weight . The instructions in no way function with the drug to create a new , unobvious product . Removing the instructions from the claimed kit does not change the ability of the drug to treat respiratory diseases . Although AstraZeneca is correct that FDA regulations require a label containing information needed for the safe and effective use of any drug , this is a requirement for FDA approval , not patentability . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This court also agrees with the district court that the dispute over whether the `` substrate '' is the label or the drug is immaterial , for in both cases the instructions do nothing more than explain how to use the known drug . Our decision in Ngai foreclosed the argument that simply adding new instructions to a known product creates the functional relationship necessary to distinguish the product from the prior art . As explained in Ngai , if this court concluded otherwise `` anyone could continue patenting a product indefinitely provided that they add a new instruction sheet to the product . '' 367 F.3d at 1339 . Neither the Patent Act nor our precedent countenances such an outcome . The district court 's determination that the kit claims are invalid is affirmed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , this court concludes that the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting the preliminary injunction and did not err in determining that the kit claims are invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BRYSON , Circuit Judge , concurring in part and dissenting in part . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I concur in the portion of the court 's opinion sustaining the district court 's ruling that the `` kit '' claims of AstraZeneca 's ¡¬603 and ¡¬099 patents are invalid . Because I believe Apotex has raised a substantial question of invalidity as to the other claims of the ¡¬603 patent , see Amazon.com , Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1343 , 1359 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) , I would reverse the district court 's grant of a preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Apotex has asserted that two prior art references anticipate the claims in dispute , the ¡¬528 patent and the Thorax advertisement . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 . The district court 's ruling that the ¡¬528 patent does not anticipate the ¡¬603 claims was predicated on an unduly narrow claim construction of the term `` budesonide composition '' in the ¡¬603 claims . The court 's construction required the budesonide to be `` dispersed in a solvent in the form of a solution or a suspension , '' and it excluded `` the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬528 [ reference . ] '' The claims of the ¡¬603 patent , however , are broader than that . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Claim 1 , the only independent method claim of the ¡¬603 patent , recites the administration of a `` nebulized dose of a budesonide composition in a continuing regimen at a frequency of not more than once per day . '' Even assuming that the reference to a `` nebulized '' dose requires dispersion in a solvent , nothing in the patent mandates a particular manner in which the budesonide and the solvent are to be combined . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ More specifically , contrary to the testimony of AstraZeneca 's expert Dr. Williams , the ¡¬603 patent does not require that the budesonide of the `` budesonide composition '' be directly suspended or dissolved *1066 in a solvent , free from encapsulation or entrapment within liposomes . In fact , the language of the patent undercuts Dr. Williams 's rationale for that interpretation . While Dr. Williams assumed that use of the `` depot effect , '' with which liposome involvement may interfere , is a critical aspect of the invention of the ¡¬603 patent , the specification explicitly disavows any need for the depot effect to occur . Thus , after describing the depot effect , the specification states : `` This proposed mechanism of action is exemplary ; the invention is not limited by any particular mechanism of action . '' ¡¬603 patent , col. 3 , ll . 12-13 . That language indicates that the patentees did not consider the depot effect to be essential to the effectiveness of once-daily-or-less dosing , as Dr. Williams claimed . Because the patented method of treatment encompasses mechanisms of action other than the depot effect , the term `` budesonide composition '' need not consist of budesonide directly dispersed in solvent , and it need not exclude the involvement of liposomes as described in the ¡¬528 reference . The ¡¬528 reference therefore appears to anticipate ( or render obvious ) the asserted claims under the proper construction of the term `` budesonide composition . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 . With respect to the 1994 advertisement for Pulmicort Respules ( r ) in the journal Thorax , AstraZeneca concedes that the advertisement discloses every limitation of the asserted method claims except for the frequency of drug administration : `` not more than once per day . '' On that issue , the district court stated : _NEWLINE_ [ a ] lthough the Thorax advertisement states that `` [ t ] he maintenance dose should be the lowest dose which keeps the patient symptom-free [ , ] '' Dr. Chipps testified that this statement does not instruct once-daily dosing because the ad was published `` back in 1994 ... before we had any information or historical perspective that once a day therapy worked for anybody . '' The Court finds this answer persuasive . _NEWLINE_ AstraZeneca LP v. Apotex , Inc. , 623 F.Supp.2d 579 , 596 ( D.N.J.2009 ) . The district court concluded that at the time of its publication the Thorax advertisement did not enable once-daily dosing , because a person of skill in the art in 1994 would not have believed that once-daily administration of Pulmicort Respules ( r ) would be effective . As the majority acknowledges , however , a prior art reference need not demonstrate utility in order to serve as an anticipating reference under section 102 . Rasmusson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp. , 413 F.3d 1318 , 1326 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Thorax advertisement contains a list of recommended dosing regimens as low as `` 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily '' ; it also suggests that `` the maintenance dosage should be the lowest dosage which keeps the patient symptom-free . '' The Apotex label similarly recommends dosages of 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg administered twice daily and states that `` [ o ] nce the desired clinical effect is achieved , consideration should be given to tapering to the lowest effective dose . '' The district court concluded that Apotex 's label induced infringement by suggesting the administration of the drug once a day . There is no reason to treat the similar recitation in the Thorax advertisement differently . The district court 's rationale for distinguishing between the Apotex label and the Thorax advertisement-that in 1994 the scientific community had yet to confirm that once-daily dosing was effective in large patient populations-does not undermine the effect of the advertisement in suggesting a reduction in dosage for particular patients , which would necessarily be achieved either by reducing the amount administered on each occasion or the frequency of administration . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1067 Because Apotex has presented a substantial question concerning the validity of the ¡¬603 patent 's method claims , I would vacate the preliminary injunction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 633 F.3d 1042 , 97 U.S.P.Q.2d 1029 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Randall R. Rader assumed the position of Chief Judge on June 1 , 2010 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The dissent notes that after discussing the depot effect , the ¡¬ 603 Patent states that `` [ t ] his proposed mechanism of action is exemplary ; the invention is not limited by any particular mechanism of action , '' ¡¬603 Patent col.3 ll.11-12 , and concludes that the testimony of Dr. Williams regarding the necessity of the depot effect is therefore contrary to the specification . But no other `` mechanism of action '' is disclosed in the patent , and the undisputed testimony of Dr. Williams-the only expert testimony provided to the court on this issue-is that after reading the ¡¬603 Patent a person of skill in the art would have understood that the claimed invention simply would not work without the depot effect . Therefore this court sees no error in the district court 's construction , as the evidence of record leaves no doubt that the claimed invention would be inoperable if the claims are construed in the manner suggested by Apotex . See Talbert Fuel Sys . Patents Co. v. Unocal Corp. , 275 F.3d 1371 , 1376 ( Fed.Cir.2002 ) , vacated and remanded on other grounds , 537 U.S. 802 , 123 S.Ct . 70 , 154 L.Ed.2d 3 ( 2002 ) ( `` [ A ] construction that renders the claimed invention inoperable should be viewed with extreme skepticism . '' ( citation omitted ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ By rearranging the language of the Thorax advertisement , the dissent makes it appear that the advertisement and the proposed label both recommend administering a starting dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg twice daily followed by eventual reduction to the lowest effective dose . But the facts do not support that suggestion . The Thorax advertisement actually specifies higher levels of initial recommended twice daily dosing and then goes on to state that `` [ t ] he maintenance dose should be the lowest dose which keeps the patient symptom-free . Recommended doses are : ... 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily . '' The Thorax advertisement thus recommends reducing a higher dose to the twice daily dose of 0.25-0.5 mg , not first administering 0.25-0.5 mg twice daily and then reducing the dosage to either once daily or twice daily doses as suggested by the dissent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

Godyak et al. , and assigned to OSRAM . *701 Because we find genuine issues of material fact that preclude a finding of anticipation and obviousness on summary judgment , and because we find that the district court erred in failing to consider objective indicia of nonobviousness , we reverse and remand for proceedings in accordance with this ruling . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . Technology at Issue _NEWLINE_ OSRAM is the assignee of the ¡¬905 patent , which claims a closed-loop tubular electrodeless lamp , having certain and specific discharge current and pressure parameters . Claim 1 , which is representative , recites : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ An electric lamp assembly comprising : _NEWLINE_ an electrodeless lamp including a closed-loop , tubular lamp envelope enclosing mercury vapor and a buffer gas at a pressure less than 0.5 torr ; _NEWLINE_ a transformer core disposed so as to surround a portion of said closed-loop lamp envelope ; _NEWLINE_ an input winding disposed on said transformer core ; and _NEWLINE_ a radio frequency power source coupled to said input winding for supplying sufficient radio frequency energy to said mercury vapor and said buffer gas to produce in said lamp envelope a discharge having a discharge current equal to or greater than about 2 amperes . _NEWLINE_ ¡¬905 patent col. 8 ll . 7-19 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ This invention generally relates to `` a low pressure , high intensity fluorescent light source that can produce considerably more light per unit length than conventional electroded fluorescent lamps . '' Electrodeless fluorescent lamps were first disclosed in several patents issued to and articles authored by John Anderson of G.E . in the 1960s and 1970s . For example , as described in the ¡¬905 patent 's `` Background of the Invention , '' Anderson claimed in U.S. Patent No . 3,987,334 ( the `` Anderson ¡¬334 patent '' ) a lamp having a torodial discharge tube that forms a continuous closed electrical path that passes through a torodial ferrite core . Applying a voltage to the wire wrapped around the ferrite core creates a magnetic flux that in turn induces a discharge voltage along the tube . In effect , the wire around the ferrite core operates as the primary of a transformer with the lamp tube operating as the secondary of the transformer . Thus , `` [ t ] he inner surface of the discharge tube is coated with a phosphor which emits visible light when irradiated by photons emitted by the excited mercury gas atoms . '' ¡¬905 patent col. 2 ll . 14-16 . The lamps described in the Anderson ¡¬334 patent operated with a buffer gas pressure of `` approximately 1 torr or less . '' The ¡¬ 905 patent specification describes Anderson 's lamp as inefficient and impractical , however . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬905 patent also describes `` a closed-loop , tubular lamp envelope enclosing mercury vapor ... a transformer core disposed around the lamp envelope , an input winding disposed on the transformer core and a radio frequency power source coupled to the input winding '' but it specifies a buffer gas pressure of `` less than about 0.5 torr . '' ¡¬905 patent col. 2 ll . 31-37 . `` The radio frequency source supplies sufficient radio frequency energy to the mercury vapor and the buffer gas to produce in the lamp envelope a discharge having a discharge current equal to or greater than about 2 amperes . '' Id . col. 2 ll . 36-41 . Operating a lamp at the parameters specified in the ¡¬905 patent-namely a buffer gas pressure of less than 0.5 torr and a discharge current equal to or greater than 2 amperes-allegedly results in a lamp with high output , high efficiency , and long operating life as compared to conventional *702 electroded fluorescent lamps . In its preferred embodiment , the lamp specified by the ¡¬905 patent operates with a buffer gas pressure equal to or less than about 0.2 torr , and a discharge current equal to or greater than about 5.0 amperes . The specification of the ¡¬905 patent makes clear that it is this novel relationship-high discharge current combined with low buffer gas pressure-that results in the increased efficiency and small power loss in the ferrite core . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II . Procedural History _NEWLINE_ On November 30 , 2009 , OSRAM filed a complaint alleging that American Induction Technologies , Inc. 's , ( `` AITI '' ) 120-watt induction lamp infringes OSRAM 's ¡¬905 patent . AITI responded with counterclaims seeking declarations of non-infringement , invalidity , and unenforceability . OSRAM moved for summary judgment that the ¡¬905 patent was infringed and not invalid and AITI cross-moved for summary judgment of invalidity due to anticipation and obviousness based on the Anderson ¡¬334 patent . On February 14 , 2011 , the district court denied OSRAM 's motions and granted AITI 's motion with respect to claim 32 . The district court ruled , from the bench , in relevant part : _NEWLINE_ Claim 32 of the ¡¬905 patent is anticipated by Anderson 's Patent No . 3,987,334 . All of the limitations of Claim 32 are disclosed either expressly or inherently in Anderson 's 334 patent . Because the buffer gas pressure disclosed in the Anderson 334 patent completely encompasses that disclosed in the ¡¬905 patent within a relatively narrow range , it discloses a pressure of less than .5 torr and renders Claim 32 invalid . Atofina versus Great Lakes Chemical Corporation , 441 F.3d 991 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) . _NEWLINE_ A4200-01 . With respect to the remaining claims , the district court characterized the parties ' positions as a `` battle of the experts '' and found that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment in favor of either party . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After the court 's finding that the Anderson ¡¬334 patent anticipated claim 32 of the ¡¬905 patent , AITI sought reconsideration of its motion for invalidity of the remaining independent claims-claims 1 , 17 , 25 , and 27 . AITI argued that these other claims differed from claim 32 only with respect to a specified discharge current of greater than 2 amperes and , therefore , were obvious combinations of lamps disclosed in the Anderson ¡¬334 patent and those described in an article by D.O . Wharmby , Ph.D. , entitled `` Electrodeless Lamps for Lighting : A Review , '' Vol . 140 IEEE Proceedings-A no . 6 , November 1993 ( `` Wharmby '' ) . Notably , AITI relied on no other references or prior art to support its renewed motion for summary judgment . In opposition , OSRAM contended that AITI failed to raise this specific combination of prior art in its original motion for summary judgment and that , regardless , OSRAM 's expert presented testimony that the different shapes of the lamps disclosed in the Anderson ¡¬334 patent and Wharmby precluded applying the teachings of one to the other . OSRAM , in particular , argued that Anderson ¡¬334 patent does not disclose all the shape limitations of claim 17-requiring two parallel tubes joined by two lateral tubes at each end . OSRAM also noted that , in denying OSRAM 's motion for summary judgment , the district court ruled that material issues of fact existed with respect to the teachings of Wharmby . AITI acknowledged OSRAM 's arguments regarding the shape of the prior art lamps and removed claim 17 from its motion for reconsideration in reply `` to avoid additional distraction from the discharge current teachings of the prior *703 art . '' J.A . 4142 . The District Court granted AITI 's motion and declared the remaining independent claims , including claim 17 , invalid as a matter of law . The court 's ruling was again read from the bench and states , in relevant part : _NEWLINE_ Defendant has demonstrated that this Court , inundated with complicated technical matters relating to the history and operation of electrodeless induction lamps , failed to consider and appreciate the affect of certain prior art references on the obviousness of certain independent claims of the ¡¬905 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ * * * _NEWLINE_ Given the virtually interchangeability between different topologies and the fact that the consequences of increasing radio frequency discharge was well known in a prior art and specifically disclosed in the D.O . Wharmby article , the improvements reflected in independent Claims 1 , 17 , 25 and 27 of increasing radio frequency discharge 2 or more amperes was merely the predicable use of prior art elements according to their established functions ; and a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that increasing radio frequency discharge to 2 or more amperes would improve tubular lamps in the same way that globular lamps and lamps of other topologies . _NEWLINE_ The increased radio frequency discharge was the only improvement presented in claims 1 , 17 , 25 and 27 . It was not found in claim 32 , which this Court has already ruled invalid for reasons of anticipation . Pursuant to KRS International Company versus Teleflex , Incorporated , these claims are obvious in light of the prior art and invalid . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 4286-86 [ sic throughout ] . OSRAM requested clarification regarding the inclusion of claim 17 in the order and the court responded that `` shape is irrelevant '' and claim 17 was , therefore , invalid as obvious . The district court ordered AITI to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to the independent claims but AITI did not comply with that order and the district court failed to issue its own . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After the independent claims were invalidated , OSRAM granted AITI a covenant not to sue as to the dependent claims , and the district court dismissed AITI 's counterclaims concerning the validity of the ¡¬905 patent 's dependent claims . The parties then proceeded with a three-day bench trial , from September 20-22 , 2011 , on AITI 's counterclaims of inequitable conduct , after which the district court found that no inequitable conduct was committed during the prosecution of the ¡¬905 patent . The district court entered final judgment on November 28 , 2011 . OSRAM timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ On appeal , OSRAM argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment that claim 32 of the ¡¬905 patent is anticipated by the Anderson ¡¬ 334 patent and that claims 1 , 17 , 25 , and 27 of the ¡¬905 patent are obvious in view of Wharmby in combination with the Anderson ¡¬334 patent . According to OSRAM , the district court resolved a disputed issue of material fact in its anticipation finding , namely that the Anderson ¡¬334 patent disclosed the operating condition of less than 0.5 torr through its reference to a lamp with `` a pressure of approximately 1 torr or less , '' and resolved numerous disputed issues of fact in its obviousness finding relating the interchangeability of lamp shapes . Additionally , OSRAM asserts that the district court 's failure to address evidence of secondary considerations of nonobviousness alone warrants reversal . AITI counters *704 that the earlier disclosed genus-1 torr or less-necessarily anticipates the later species-less than 0.5 torr-and that the claims are otherwise obvious in light of various combinations of prior art.1 AITI also contends that OSRAM failed to present evidence of a nexus between the claimed invention and the alleged secondary considerations and we , therefore , may overlook the district court 's failure to address them below . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I . _NEWLINE_ This court reviews a district court 's grant of summary judgment without deference .

A patent claim is anticipated if each and every limitation is found in a single prior art reference . 35 U.S.C . ¡± 102 . Patents are presumed to be valid and invalidity must be proven by clear and convincing evidence . Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P'ship , -- - U.S. -- -- , 131 S.Ct . 2238 , 2242 , 180 L.Ed.2d 131 ( 2011 ) . OSRAM argues that AITI faced an enhanced burden in establishing anticipation because the examiner considered the Anderson *705 ¡¬334 patent during the prosecution of the ¡¬905 patent . While prior consideration of a reference during prosecution may carry some weight , the burden to prove invalidity does not change ; at all times , it remains a showing `` by clear and convincing evidence . '' Id . ; see also Tokai , 632 F.3d at 1367 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The parties ' dispute centers on whether the Anderson ¡¬334 patent discloses a buffer gas pressure of less than 0.5 torr . AITI primarily relies on the legal argument that `` the disclosure of a small genus may anticipate the species of that genus even if the species are not themselves recited . '' Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Ben Venue Labs. , Inc. , 246 F.3d 1368 , 1380 ( Fed.Cir.2001 ) . Referencing our decisions in Atofina v. Great Lakes Chemical Corp. , 441 F.3d 991 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) and ClearValue , Inc. v. Pearl River Polymers , Inc. , 668 F.3d 1340 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) , AITI asserts that the range in the Anderson ¡¬334 patent , which completely encompasses the range in the ¡¬905 patent , is sufficient to disclose the claimed buffer gas pressure in the ¡¬905 patent.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We disagree . While it is true that an earlier disclosed genus may , in certain circumstances , anticipate a later species , this inquiry necessarily includes a factual component . See , e.g. , Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex , Inc. , 550 F.3d 1075 , 1083 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( `` [ W ] hether a generic disclosure necessarily anticipates everything within the genus ... depends on the factual aspects of the specific disclosure and the particular products at issue . `` ) ; Atofina , 441 F.3d at 999 ; In re Baird , 16 F.3d 380 , 382 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) . For example , in Atofina we analyzed a patent claiming a method of synthesizing difluoromethane at a temperature between 330-450 degrees Celsius . Atofina , 441 F.3d at 993 . The prior art , in contrast , disclosed a broad temperature range of 100-500 degrees Celsius . Id . at 999 . In Atofina , we reversed the district court 's finding of anticipation following a bench trial and we explained that our holding was premised on the `` considerable difference between the claimed [ temperature ] range and the range in the prior art . '' Id . Our decision in Atofina clarified that the prior art 's teaching of a broad genus does not necessarily disclose every species within that genus . Id . Under the circumstances presented in Atofina , `` no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the prior art describes the claimed range with sufficient specificity to anticipate this limitation of the claim . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Contrary to AITI 's assertions , our decision in ClearValue does nothing to alter the unequivocal statements in Atofina . There , we analyzed a patent relating to clarifying low alkalinity water and found that the jury lacked substantial evidence to find that certain prior art-disclosing a chemical process with a range of 150 ppm or less-did not anticipate the asserted patent or disclose the claimed limitation of 50 ppm . ClearValue , 668 F.3d 1340 , 1344-45 . In ClearValue , we explained that , in contrast to the patentee in Atofina , ClearValue did not argue that the 50 ppm limitation was critical , or that the claimed method worked differently at different points within the prior art range of 150 ppm or less . Id . And , ClearValue did not allege that one of ordinary skill would not have recognized 50 ppm as an acceptable *706 value for the range provided in the prior art . Id . at 1345 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A correct application of Atofina and ClearValue to the evidence presented here reveals clear disputed material issues of fact and mandates reversal of the district court 's finding of anticipation . OSRAM contends-and presented expert testimony and evidence to support its contention-that the limitation of less than 0.5 torr is central to the invention claimed in the ¡¬ 905 patent and that a lamp would operate differently at various points within the range disclosed in the Anderson ¡¬334 patent . Specifically , the patent itself claims that prior lamps , including those disclosed in the Anderson ¡¬334 patent , are inefficient and impractical as compared to the ¡¬ 905 lamp precisely because they use pressure well above that claimed in the ¡¬ 905 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A trial may reveal a minimal difference between the Anderson ¡¬334 patent prior range of `` approximately 1 torr or less '' and the less than 0.5 torr claimed in the ¡¬905 patent , or that one of ordinary skill would interpret `` approximately 1 torr or less '' as clearly disclosing less than 0.5 torr as an acceptable choice within that range , but those questions can not be resolved as a matter of law on this record . Indeed , AITI made no effort to rebut the testimony of OSRAM 's expert regarding the importance of the claimed pressure to the invention or regarding what one of ordinary skill would have understood from the disclosures in the Anderson ¡¬334 patent . AITI relies , instead , on the conclusory claim that less than 0.5 torr necessarily falls within `` approximately 1 torr or less '' as a matter of fact . While true , the inquiry does not end there . How one of ordinary skill in the art would understand the scope of the disclosure or , stated differently , how one of ordinary skill in the art would understand the relative size of a genus or species in a particular technology is of critical importance . And the district court 's failure to explain or support its statement that `` the buffer gas pressure disclosed in the Anderson ¡¬334 patent completely encompasses that disclosed in the ¡¬905 patent within a relatively narrow range , '' or to justify its complete rejection of OSRAM 's expert testimony , complicates our review . We have no choice but to reverse the district court 's finding of anticipation on this record . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ III . _NEWLINE_ The district court 's obviousness rulings also fail because they depend on resolution of disputed issues of fact . A patent may not issue `` if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains . '' 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) . Obviousness is a question of law based on underlying factual findings : ( 1 ) the scope and content of the prior art ; ( 2 ) the differences between the claims and the prior art ; ( 3 ) the level of ordinary skill in the art ; and ( 4 ) objective considerations of nonobviousness . Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) . Generally , a party seeking to invalidate a patent as obvious must demonstrate `` by clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the teaching of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention , and that the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so . '' Pfizer , Inc. v. Apotex , Inc. , 480 F.3d 1348 , 1361 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ; see also Amgen , Inc. v. F. Hoffman-LA Roche Ltd. , 580 F.3d 1340 , 1362 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( `` An obviousness determination requires that a skilled artisan would have perceived a reasonable *707 expectation of success in making the invention in light of the prior art . '' ( citations omitted ) ) . The Supreme Court has warned , however , that , while an analysis of any teaching , suggestion , or motivation to combine known elements is useful to an obviousness analysis , the overall obviousness inquiry must be expansive and flexible . KSR Int ' l Co. v. Teleflex , Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 415 , 419 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . _NEWLINE_ The district court did no more than recite the test of KSR and draw general conclusions based thereon in its ruling on obviousness . The court did not make any specific findings of fact and gave no basis-other than an admission that it previously failed to consider submissions by the parties-for reversing its prior statement that disputed issues of fact existed . OSRAM recognizes-correctly-that Rule 52 ( a ) ( 3 ) states that a `` court is not required to state findings or conclusions when ruling on a motion under Rule ... 56 . '' But , as OSRAM correctly notes , both this Circuit and the Ninth Circuit repeatedly have made clear that a trial court must at least provide its analysis and grounds for entering judgment somewhere in the record . AITI counters that the district court 's findings are ascertainable from the parties ' own arguments and again contends that , because we review judgments not opinions , we are free to affirm on any ground supported by the record . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ It is not our role to scour the record and search for something to justify a lower court 's conclusions , particularly at the summary judgment stage . Whether dealing with an issue of law like claim construction or an issue of fact such as infringement , this court must be furnished `` sufficient findings and reasoning to permit meaningful appellate scrutiny . '' Nazomi Communs. , Inc. v. Arm Holdings , PLC , 403 F.3d 1364 , 1371 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) ( quoting Gechter v. Davidson , 116 F.3d 1454 , 1458 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) ) . Where , as here , the record is devoid of meaningful analysis , we will not conduct such an analysis in the first instance . Id . ; see also Research Corp. Techs . v. Microsoft Corp. , 536 F.3d 1247 , 1254 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( `` Microsoft 's motions for summary judgment were granted without a proper analysis regarding inequitable conduct . This court therefore lacks findings and conclusions for adequate review. '' ) . We previously have had occasion to remind this very district court of these important principles ; we do so once more here . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In TriMed , Inc. v. Stryker Corp. , 608 F.3d 1333 , 1343 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) , we reversed this district court 's obviousness ruling for failing to address , among other things , what the asserted prior art teaches : _NEWLINE_ Both the record in this case and the order granting Stryker 's motion for summary judgment are devoid of such reasoning . Instead of supporting its obviousness analysis with cogent reasoning , the order merely states that `` [ a ] common sense [ sic ] solution to this problem [ i.e. , pin migration ] involves stabilizing the pin against ... displacement ... [ and ] the logical solution would be to select a prior art plate that had holes with an appropriate diameter ... . '' Order Granting Stryker 's Mot . For Summ . J. of Invalidity 14 . Neither the record before us nor the order of the district court explains why one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would have found replacing a cast normally used to stabilize a pin with a subcutaneous metal plate to be a logical , commonsense solution to this problem . Merely saying that an invention is a logical , commonsense solution to a known problem does not make it so . _NEWLINE_ *708 Id . AITI tries to limit TriMed to scenarios where the district court explicitly references only `` common sense '' as the basis for its obviousness findings . There is no justification for limiting TriMed in that fashion , however . The point made there , as here , is that the trial court must explain how it reached the conclusions it does , particularly where there is evidence in the record supporting the non-movant 's position . AITI 's request that we forgive the lower court 's failure to explain its ruling-and insistence that we should review the record in the first instance to ascertain what the lower court might have been thinking-rings particularly hollow given AITI 's failure to respond to the trial court 's order to submit findings of fact and conclusions of law . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . _NEWLINE_ With respect to the substance of the district court 's ruling on obviousness , OSRAM primarily takes issue with the district court 's pronouncement that `` shape is irrelevant '' and that `` a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that increasing radio frequency discharge to 2 or more amperes would improve tubular lamps in the same way that [ sic ] globular lamps and lamps of other topologies . '' J.A . 4286 . AITI responds that claims 1 , 25 , 27 , and 32 of the ¡¬905 patent are prima facie obvious based on Wharmby . According to AITI , Wharmby discloses a lamp meeting the physical configurations of the ¡¬905 patent lamp by way of reference to an earlier Anderson article regarding operating conditions within the scope of those claimed by the ¡¬905 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Substantial factual disputes exist , however , as to whether one of ordinary skill would consider the lamp shape to be irrelevant or , more specifically , whether one of ordinary skill would have been motivated to combine the Anderson lamp with Wharmby or operate the Anderson lamp at the conditions disclosed in Wharmby . OSRAM 's expert , Dr. Lawler , testified that Wharmby `` teaches away from the closed-loop tubular design of the ¡¬905 patent '' and AITI 's expert , Mr. Edward Hammer , acknowledged that Wharmby disparages the very external ferrite core , closed-loop tubular design of the Anderson patent that AITI argued would be obvious to combine with Wharmby . J.A . 4101 ; A4106-07 . OSRAM also references Dr. Lawler 's opinion that `` discharge plasmas are inherently unpredictable and may behave differently in different lamp topologies ... . One could not predict results or success simply by taking known discharge plasma behavioral characteristics from globular-style lamps and trying to apply them to a closed-loop tubular lamp with external ferrite cores . '' J.A . 4108-09 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Additionally , at the inequitable conduct trial , AITI focused on the purported failure of the ¡¬905 patent 's inventors to disclose certain prior art references about globular lamps , including two articles written by the inventors and Wharmby . The district court , after hearing live testimony , reached the conclusion that the inventors of the ¡¬905 patent credibly believed that Wharmby was not material to the ¡¬905 patent . While the question of intent and credibility as it relates to inequitable conduct is certainly different than the scope of a prior art reference , this finding highlights the inconsistent and unsupportable nature of the district court 's ruling on obviousness and lays bare a disputed issue of fact with respect to the teachings of Wharmby . For at least this reason we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. _NEWLINE_ Separately , and in addition , nothing in the record indicates that the *709 court considered OSRAM 's evidence of secondary considerations of nonobviousness . At summary judgment , OSRAM submitted evidence of long felt need , failure of others , and industry praise , evidence which AITI did not rebut below . AITI makes no effort to argue that the district court considered this evidence , or even to claim that it did rebut OSRAM 's proffered evidence . Instead , AITI asks that we reject OSRAM 's evidence of secondary considerations by finding in the first instance that OSRAM 's evidence is not tied adequately to the full scope of the asserted claims . AITI 's arguments are without merit . Despite AITI 's contentions , we have emphatically rejected any formal burden-shifting framework in evaluating the four Graham factors and the district court 's failure to consider the evidence requires reversal . See Wm . Wrigley Jr. Co. v. Cadbury Adams USA LLC , 683 F.3d 1356 , 1365 n. 5 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) , In re Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsule Patent Litigation , 676 F.3d 1063 , 1076 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) , Ruiz v. A.B . Chance Co. , 234 F.3d 654 , 667 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ; see also Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling , Inc. v. Maersk Drilling USA , Inc. , 699 F.3d 1340 , 1349 ( Fed.Cir.2012 ) ( emphasizing the importance of objective indicia of nonobviousness to the ultimate conclusion of obviousness and making clear that `` to determine obviousness , the decisionmaker must be able to consider all four Graham factors . `` ) ; TriMed , 608 F.3d at 1343 ( `` We have repeatedly held that evidence of secondary considerations must be considered if present ... . There is no indication in the record that , as required by our precedent , the court considered at all the evidence of secondary considerations offered by TriMed. '' ) . On remand , the district court must , in the first instance , consider secondary considerations before finding a claim obvious . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D. _NEWLINE_ The parties disagree as to the propriety of the district court 's decision to include claim 17 in its ruling on obviousness after AITI expressly removed that claim from its initial summary judgment motion . While a trial court may invalidate a claim sua sponte , where no motion regarding that claim is before it , it may not do so without prior notice to the non-movant and an opportunity for the non-movant to address such an unanticipated action . See Portland Retail Druggists Ass ' n v. Kaiser Found . Health Plan , 662 F.2d 641 , 645 ( 9th Cir.1981 ) . Because we reverse the court 's determination of obviousness on other grounds , we need not and do not reach this issue . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For all of the reasons discussed above , we reverse the judgment of invalidity and remand this matter for trial . While the scope and content of the prior art , the motivation to combine certain references , and the impact of OSRAM 's evidence of secondary considerations , all may be resolved in AITI 's favor at trial , the district court 's treatment of the record on summary judgment was both inadequate and improper . We will not undertake an analysis of anticipation and obviousness that should have been performed by the district court-but was not-in the first instance . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED AND REMANDED . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ COSTS _NEWLINE_ Each party shall bear its own costs . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 701 F.3d 698 , 105 U.S.P.Q.2d 1368 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to both anticipation and obviousness , AITI , apparently relying on the principle that this court `` reviews judgments , not opinions , '' presents extensive argument on appeal relating to prior art that was not the subject of AITI 's motions for summary judgment . That OSRAM discussed these references in OSRAM 's motion for summary judgment of no invalidity-a motion that was denied because it raised disputed material issues of fact-does not permit AITI to rely on these references on appeal . AITI 's motions for summary judgment were predicated on only two references ; the trial court 's judgment was predicated on only those same two references ; this appeal must follow suit . Because we have not considered the teachings of the references AITI raised for the first time on appeal , we express no opinion as to their relevance or impact on the issue of invalidity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AITI also claims , citing to the axiom `` that which would literally infringe if later anticipates if earlier , '' Bristol-Myers Squibb , 246 F.3d at 1378 , that a lamp practicing the Anderson ¡¬334 patent would anticipate the claims of the ¡¬905 patent . But this argument ignores the fact that the Anderson ¡¬334 patent could be practiced-with a buffer gas pressure of 0.5 torr or above-without infringing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

( collectively , the `` Defendants '' ) appeal from the final decision of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey sustaining the validity of the asserted claims of U.S. Patent 5,006,528 ( the `` ¡¬528 patent '' ) under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 and under the doctrine of nonstatutory double patenting . We affirm . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disease affecting about one percent of the human population . Despite extensive research , the cause , mechanism , and etiology of schizophrenia remain unknown . Individuals with schizophrenia suffer from positive symptoms , negative symptoms , and cognitive deficits . Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions . Negative symptoms include flat affect , poverty *1284 of speech , inability to experience pleasure , lack of desire to form relationships , and lack of motivation . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Drugs that treat schizophrenia are called antipsychotics . The first antipsychotic drug , chlorpromazine , was discovered by accident in the early 1950s . Subsequent research revealed that chlorpromazine 's antipsychotic properties were due to its antagonism ( blocking ) of dopamine receptors in the brain . That finding resulted in the development of other `` typical '' antipsychotics , which treat positive symptoms but not negative symptoms and have a number of problematic side effects , including extrapyramidal symptoms ( `` EPS '' ) , tardive dyskinesia , prolactin elevation ( hyperprolactinemia ) , and sudden decrease in blood pressure ( orthostatic hypotension ) . The United States Food and Drug Administration ( `` FDA '' ) last approved a typical antipsychotic in 1975 . Despite their drawbacks , typical antipsychotics are still used today . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Researchers discovered clozapine in the early 1960s . Clozapine was the first `` atypical '' antipsychotic , in that it had a diminished propensity to cause EPS and was useful for treating both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia . Clozapine had serious potential side effects , however , including orthostatic hypotension , frank hypotension , and agranulocytosis ( a life-threatening decrease in white blood cells ) . Due to those side effects clozapine was withdrawn from clinical trials in the 1970s , prompting scientists to seek an atypical antipsychotic drug similar to clozapine with respect to efficacy but lacking its toxicity and side effects . Researchers ' efforts were largely unsuccessful , however , and the FDA approved no new antipsychotic drugs between 1976 and 1989 . The FDA finally approved clozapine in 1990 , but only for treatment-resistant or treatment-intolerant patients , subject to rigorous blood testing . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The FDA approved risperidone , the first postclozapine atypical antipsychotic , in 1994 . Since then the FDA has approved seven other atypical antipsychotics : olanzapine ( 1996 ) ; quetiapine ( 1997 ) ; ziprasidone ( 2001 ) ; aripiprazole ( 2002 ) ; paliperidone ( 2007 ) ; asenapine ( 2009 ) ; and iloperidone ( 2009 ) . Although clozapine remains the `` gold standard '' with respect to efficacy , the other atypical antipsychotics are considered at least as effective as typical antipsychotics for treating positive symptoms , while also treating negative symptoms and causing fewer EPS side effects . Every FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic has a chemical structure related either to clozapine or risperidone , with the sole exception of aripiprazole-the compound at issue in the present appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Aripiprazole is the active ingredient in the antipsychotic drug marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. ( `` Otsuka '' ) under the brand name Abilify ( r ) . The culmination of several decades of drug development efforts , Abilify ( r ) was approved in 2002 by the FDA and is marketed for the treatment of schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , irritability associated with autistic disorder in pediatric patients , and as an add-on treatment for depression . Abilify ( r ) has been commercially successful ; since 2005 its annual sales have exceeded a billion dollars , and in 2009 its sales were $ 3.3 billion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Aripiprazole has the chemical name 7- { 4- [ 4- ( 2 , 3-dichlorophenyl ) -1-piperazinyl ] -butoxy } -3,4-dihydrocarbostyril and has the following chemical structure : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1285 aripiprazole _NEWLINE_ Otsuka Pharm . Co. v. Sandoz , Inc. , No . 3:07-cv-1000 , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *4-5 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *15 ( D.N.J . Nov. 15 , 2010 ) . Aripiprazole is a `` carbostyril derivative , '' that is , its chemical structure contains a quinolinone fused ring ( labeled as `` 3,4-dihydrocarbostyril '' in the structure above ) . Aripiprazole 's carbostyril ring is referred to as `` 3,4-dihydro '' because it has two hydrogen atoms ( not shown in the structure above ) connected to the 3 and 4 positions , and thus has a single bond between these two carbon atoms . In contrast , a `` carbostyril '' moiety has only one hydrogen atom at the 3 and 4 positions and a resulting double bond between the carbon atoms . Researchers refer to both variants as `` carbostyril derivatives . '' Connected to the 7-position of aripiprazole 's carbostyril core is a `` butoxy linker '' consisting of four methylene ( -CH2- ) units . A `` propoxy linker , '' in contrast , consists of only three methylene units . Connected to aripiprazole 's butoxy linker is a piperazine ring and a phenyl ring . The terminal phenyl ring of aripiprazole is `` 2,3-dichloro '' substituted , meaning that it has chlorine atoms connected to the 2 and 3 positions . _NEWLINE_ Otsuka is the assignee of the ¡¬528 patent , which has a foreign priority date of October 31 , 1988 , was filed on October 20 , 1989 , and issued on April 9 , 1991 .

Otsuka brought actions against these generic drug manufacturers for patent infringement ; most of those actions were consolidated into the case *1286 now before us on appeal . See Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *1 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *3-5 .

The Defendants conceded that their ANDA filings constituted literal infringement but asserted in defense and counterclaimed that the claims were invalid for obviousness and obviousness-type double patenting.1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The district court held a bench trial from August 5 through August 26 , 2010 , and heard closing arguments on October 21 , 2010 . The court entered its Amended Memorandum Opinion on December 15 , 2010 . See id . at *1 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *5 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On the issue of obviousness under ¡± 103 , the court concluded that the Defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill . In its analysis , the court considered the known carbostyril derivatives , with particular emphasis on the three purported `` lead compounds '' asserted by the Defendants . Id . at *17 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *53 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The first of the Defendants ' alleged lead compounds is 7- [ 4- ( 4-phenylpiperazinyl ) -butoxy ] -3,4-dihydrocarbostyril , which has the following chemical structure : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` unsubstituted butoxy '' _NEWLINE_ Br . Defs.-Appellants Apotex , at 12 . The parties refer to this compound as the `` unsubstituted butoxy , '' because its phenyl ring is unsubstituted and it has a butoxy linker connecting the 7-position of its carbostyril core to its piperazine ring . _NEWLINE_ The unsubstituted butoxy is disclosed and claimed in Otsuka 's earlier U.S. Patent 4,734,416 ( the `` ¡¬416 patent '' ) , which the parties agree is prior art to the ¡¬528 patent . The ¡¬416 patent issued on March 29 , 1988 , and expired on March 29 , 2005 . Entitled `` Pharmaceutically Useful Carbostyril Derivatives , '' the ¡¬416 patent teaches a broad genus encompassing `` approximately nine trillion compounds . '' Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *3 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *12 . The ¡¬416 patent discloses that `` [ c ] arbostyril derivatives having antihistaminic action and central nervous controlling action are useful as antihistaminic agents or central nervous controlling agents . '' ¡¬416 patent abstract . The patent further discloses that the compounds : _NEWLINE_ are useful for central nervous controlling agents such as central muscle relaxing agents , sleep-inducing agents , pre-operative drugs , antischizophrenia agents , sedatives , antianxiety drugs , antimanic depressive psychosis agents , antipyretic agents , analgetic agents and depressors , without showing side-effects such as the feeling of thirst , constipation , tachycordia [ sic ] , parkinsonism , and/or delayed dyscinesia [ sic ] which exist with conventional central nervous controlling agents . _NEWLINE_ *1287 Id . col.3 ll.14-22 . Claim 13 of the ¡¬416 patent claims the unsubstituted butoxy using its chemical name . Id . col.70 ll.62-63 . Claim 50 claims `` [ a ] method of producing an antihistaminic effect in a mammal comprising the step of administering to the mammal for producing said antihistaminic effect a pharmaceutical composition containing a suitable amount of a carbostyril derivative '' having a general chemical formula , id . col.76 ll.1-60 , and claim 116 claims `` [ t ] he method of claim 50 , wherein the carbostyril derivative is selected from the group consisting of '' nine specific carbostyril derivatives , including the unsubstituted butoxy , id . col.84 ll.29-46 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The unsubstituted butoxy is also disclosed in a declaration submitted during the prosecution of the ¡¬416 patent by one of that patent 's co-inventors , Dr. Kazuyuki Nakagawa ( the `` Nakagawa declaration '' ) . J.A . 3792-3807 . The Nakagawa declaration discloses three sets of test data comparing certain carbostyril derivatives . The first two measure the compounds ' antihistaminic activity . The third involves a test for `` Activity for inhibiting jumping behavior in mouse induced by Methamphetamine and LDOPA . '' J.A . 3803 . Although the Nakagawa declaration nowhere mentions schizophrenia or antipsychotic activity , and despite conflicting evidence regarding the use of mouse jumping test data in antipsychotic drug discovery , the district court found that Dr. Nakagawa 's mouse jumping data `` could be indicative of potential antipsychotic activity to the skilled artisan . '' Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *10 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *34 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Nakagawa declaration provides mouse jumping test data for nine carbostyril derivative test compounds and two prior art reference compounds . The potency of the compounds is indicated with an effective dosage ( `` ED 50 '' ) value measured in milligrams per kilogram , wherein a lower value indicates greater potency in the mouse jumping test .

The two most potent carbostyril derivatives tested in the mouse jumping study have a 5-propoxy linker , i.e. , a propoxy substituent connected at the 5-position of the carbostyril core . Compound 44 , the most potent derivative with an ED 50 of 0.53 , has a 5-propoxy linker and an ethoxy substituent ( -OCH2CH3 ) at the 2-position of its phenyl ring . Compound 5 , the second most potent derivative *1288 with an ED 50 of 2.1 , has a 5-propoxy linker and an unsubstituted phenyl ring . Of the 7-linked carbostyril derivatives for which Dr. Nakagawa provided mouse jumping data , Compound 39 , a 3-chloro substituted propoxy,2 had an ED 50 of 2.5 ; Compound 43 , a 2-chloro substituted propoxy , had an ED 50 of 3.4 ; Compound 41 , the unsubstituted butoxy , had an ED 50 of 5.5 ; Compound 6 , an unsubstituted propoxy , had an ED 50 of 9.3 ; and Compound 16 , a 4-chloro substituted propoxy , had an ED 50 of 15.1 . Thus , the best compounds in this test were the propoxys , not the butoxy . _NEWLINE_ The second alleged lead compound considered by the district court is a carbostyril derivative with the chemical name 7- { 3- [ 4- ( 2,3-dichlorophenyl ) -1-piperazinyl ] -propoxy } 3,4-dihydrocarbostyril and the chemical structure depicted below : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` 2,3-dichloro propoxy '' _NEWLINE_ Br . Defs.-Appellants Apotex , at 9 . The parties refer to this compound as the `` 2,3-dichloro propoxy '' because its phenyl ring is substituted with a chlorine atom at the 2 and 3 positions and it has a propoxy linker connecting its carbostyril core and its piperazine ring . The 2,3-dichloro propoxy was disclosed in two prior art foreign counterparts to Otsuka 's ¡¬416 patent : German Patent 2,912,105 ( the `` DE ¡¬105 patent '' ) , J.A . 3808-930 , at 3926 ( example 317 ) ; and Swedish Patent Publication 434,945 ( the `` SE ¡¬945 application '' ) , J.A . 6396-565 , at 6556 ( example 134 ) . Like the ¡¬416 patent , the SE ¡¬945 application teaches that its carbostyril derivatives `` can be used as antihistamines or agents having a regulating action in the central nervous system , '' J.A . 6495 , and discloses numerous examples of agents in the latter category : _NEWLINE_ The compounds according to the present invention are therefore useful as means of controlling the central nervous system as muscle relaxants , sleeping agents , presurgery drugs , antischizophrenia agents , sedatives , anxiolytics , drugs for manic-depressive psychosis , fever-lowering agents , analgesics and `` depressors '' without showing side effects such as thirst , constipation , tachycardia , parkinsonism and/or delayed dyschezia , which are displayed by conventional agents which act on the central nervous system . _NEWLINE_ J.A . 6499 . The SE ¡¬945 application `` discloses dozens of carbostyril compounds , '' and the 2,3-dichloro propoxy `` is just one of ninety-six different compounds disclosed in Example 134 alone . '' Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *11 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *37-38 . The DE ¡¬105 patent `` is substantially the same as the SE ¡¬945 application except that the DE ¡¬105 Patent omits any mention of potential antipsychotic activity . '' Id . at *12 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *38 . _NEWLINE_ The final purported lead compound considered by the district court is OPC-4392 . This carbostyril derivative , which has the following chemical structure , has a 2,3- *1289 dimethyl substituted phenyl ring , a propoxy linker , and a carbostyril ring containing a double bond at the 3 , 4-position : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ `` OPC-4392 '' _NEWLINE_ Br . Defs.-Appellants Apotex , at 10 . OPC-4392 is an Otsuka development compound and , as of the priority date of the ¡¬528 patent , was the only carbostyril derivative tested in humans as a potential antipsychotic . A prior art article published in 1987 describes OPC-4392 as `` a totally new compound that is an anti-psychotic drug being developed . '' Mitsukuni Murasaki , New Psycho-Neuro Agents , 16 Japanese J . Clinical Psychiatry 1515 , 1517 ( 1987 ) ( `` Murasaki 1987 '' ) ; J.A . 5891-919 , at 5907 . The Murasaki 1987 article further notes that `` the anti-psychotic action was not strong but the strength of the activating action stood out , '' that `` improvements were observed in the negative symptoms , '' and that `` the extra-pyramidal disturbances are extremely weak . '' J.A . 5907 . A prior art publication from January 1988 by the same author stated that OPC-4392 was `` expected to have some advantageous effects different from those of conventional antipsychotic drugs , '' such as chlorpromazine . Mitsukuni Murasaki , Phase 1 Study of a New Antipsychotic Drug , OPC-4392 , 12 Progress Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 793 , 802 ( 1988 ) ( `` Murasaki 1988 '' ) ; J.A . 10396-406 , at 10405 . Although the article stated that OPC-4392 was `` expected to have fewer side effects than conventional drugs of the same class , '' it also reported that subjects receiving a 5-milligram dose of OPC-4392 `` experienced sleeplessness , stagger , weakness , fatigability , heavy headedness , lack of motivation and disturbed concentration , which were so severe that they were not able to perform daily routine work . '' J.A . 10397 , 10401 . _NEWLINE_ Evaluating the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art , the district court found that the asserted prior art did not teach one of ordinary skill to select the unsubstituted butoxy , the 2,3-dichloro propoxy , or OPC-4392 as a lead compound for further antipsychotic research . Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *18-19 , *20 , *22 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *59 , *64 , *70 . Rather , the court found that a structure like clozapine or risperidone-both of which are structurally dissimilar to aripiprazole-would have been an attractive lead compound . Id . at *23-24 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *76 . The court thus concluded that the Defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that one of ordinary skill would have been motivated to combine the asserted prior art to make aripiprazole and would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so . Id . at *23-24 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *76-77 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The court then turned to the issue of nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting . The court considered whether aripiprazole and its uses are not patentably distinct from the unsubstituted butoxy in claim 13 of the ¡¬416 patent . *1290 Id . at *27-28 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *88 . Noting the structural differences between aripiprazole and the unsubstituted butoxy , the court found that the prior art did not teach one of ordinary skill to achieve antipsychotic activity by modifying the unsubstituted butoxy with a 2,3-dichloro substitution on its phenyl ring to make aripiprazole . Id . at *28-29 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *90-91 . The court thus concluded that the Defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims were invalid for nonstatutory double patenting . Id . at *29 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *92 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On December 15 , 2010 , the court entered its Amended Order and Final Judgment in favor of Otsuka . Otsuka Pharm . Co. v. Sandoz , Inc. , No . 3:07-cv-1000 , 2010 WL 4596324 ( D.N.J . Nov. 15 , 2010 ) . The Defendants timely appealed . We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C . ¡± 1295 ( a ) ( 1 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ A patent is invalid if an alleged infringer proves , by clear and convincing evidence , that the differences between the claimed subject matter and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the pertinent art . 35 U.S.C . ¡±¡± 103 ( a ) , 282 ( 2 ) ; Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. , -- - U.S. -- -- , 131 S.Ct . 2238 , 2242 , 180 L.Ed.2d 131 ( 2011 ) . Obviousness is a question of law with underlying factual findings , including : ( 1 ) the scope and content of the prior art ; ( 2 ) the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art ; ( 3 ) the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art ; and ( 4 ) objective evidence such as commercial success , long-felt need , and the failure of others . Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 17-18 , 86 S.Ct . 684 , 15 L.Ed.2d 545 ( 1966 ) . Similarly , nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting is a question of law with underlying findings of fact . In re Longi , 759 F.2d 887 , 892 ( Fed.Cir.1985 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Following a bench trial , we review the district court 's conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error . Golden Blount , Inc. v. Robert H. Peterson Co. , 365 F.3d 1054 , 1058 ( Fed.Cir.2004 ) . A factual finding is clearly erroneous if , despite some supporting evidence , we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made . United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co. , 333 U.S. 364 , 395 , 68 S.Ct . 525 , 92 L.Ed . 746 ( 1948 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ We first address the Defendants ' arguments that the district court erred by failing to hold the asserted claims invalid for obviousness under ¡± 103.3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Defendants contend that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the prior art carbostyril derivative compounds at the time aripiprazole was invented . They assert that the lead compound analysis applied by the district court violates our precedent and `` fall [ s ] into a rigid obviousness analysis precluded by KSR . '' Br . Defs.Appellants Apotex , at 35-36 . In this regard , the Defendants allege that the court erred by assuming that `` only the *1291 most obvious choice could serve as a lead . '' Id . at 34 . According to the Defendants , prior art compounds , including the 2,3-dichloro propoxy , the unsubstituted butoxy , and OPC-4392 , were known to have antipsychotic activity , and it would have been obvious to chemically modify them in the ways necessary to make aripiprazole . Finally , they argue that aripiprazole 's properties and other secondary considerations do not render aripiprazole nonobvious . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Otsuka , in response , argues that the district court correctly rejected the Defendants ' obviousness contentions , which are based on improper hindsight bias . Otsuka points out that no carbostyril derivative had been shown to effectively treat schizophrenia as of the priority date of the ¡¬528 patent . Otsuka also contends that the district court did not require proof that aripiprazole was the `` most obvious '' compound , but rather evaluated all of the potential choices available to one of ordinary skill and determined that the prior art did not suggest that the unsubstituted butoxy , 2,3-dichloro propoxy , or OPC-4392 would be suitable lead compounds . Otsuka also asserts that secondary considerations support the court 's conclusion of nonobviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For the following reasons , we hold that the district court correctly determined that the Defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims would have been obvious under ¡± 103 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A . The District Court 's `` Lead Compound '' Analysis _NEWLINE_ In cases involving the patentability of a new chemical compound , prima facie obviousness under the third Graham factor generally turns on the structural similarities and differences between the claimed compound and the prior art compounds . Daiichi Sankyo Co. v. Matrix Labs. , Ltd. , 619 F.3d 1346 , 1352 ( Fed.Cir.2010 ) . The Defendants assert that the district court erred by employing a `` lead compound '' analysis as part of its determination under the third Graham factor . We reject that contention . New compounds may be created from theoretical considerations rather than from attempts to improve on prior art compounds . In this case , however , the parties ' arguments focus on selecting and modifying particular prior art compounds , designated as lead compounds . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Our case law demonstrates that whether a new chemical compound would have been prima facie obvious over particular prior art compounds ordinarily follows a two-part inquiry . First , the court determines whether a chemist of ordinary skill would have selected the asserted prior art compounds as lead compounds , or starting points , for further development efforts . Eisai Co. v. Dr. Reddy 's Labs. , Ltd. , 533 F.3d 1353 , 1359 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ( `` [ P ] ost-KSR , a prima facie case of obviousness for a chemical compound still , in general , begins with the reasoned identification of a lead compound. '' ) . A lead compound , as we have explained , is `` a compound in the prior art that would be most promising to modify in order to improve upon its ... activity and obtain a compound with better activity . '' Takeda Chem . Indus. , Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty. , Ltd. , 492 F.3d 1350 , 1357 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . As such , a lead compound is `` a natural choice for further development efforts . '' Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharm . USA , Inc. , 566 F.3d 999 , 1008 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) . In recent cases involving the alleged obviousness of a new chemical compound , the parties have frequently focused upon the notion that a chemist must select one or more lead compounds . E.g. , Daiichi , 619 F.3d at 1352 ; Altana , 566 F.3d at 1007 ; Procter & Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharm . *1292 USA , Inc. , 566 F.3d 989 , 994 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ; Eisai , 533 F.3d at 1357 ; Takeda , 492 F.3d at 1357 ; Eli Lilly & Co. v. Zenith Goldline Pharm. , Inc. , 471 F.3d 1369 , 1379 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) ; Yamanouchi Pharm . Co. v. Danbury Pharmacal , Inc. , 231 F.3d 1339 , 1345 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ; cf . Unigene Labs. , Inc. v. Apotex , Inc. , 655 F.3d 1352 , 1362 ( Fed.Cir.2011 ) ( `` [ T ] he term 'reference composition ' is more appropriate than 'lead compound ' when considering obviousness for a chemical composition. '' ) . In such cases our analysis focuses on those proposed lead compounds that the alleged infringer has attempted to prove , by clear and convincing evidence , that the skilled artisan would have had a reason to select from the panoply of known compounds in the prior art . Daiichi , 619 F.3d at 1354 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In determining whether a chemist would have selected a prior art compound as a lead , the analysis is guided by evidence of the compound 's pertinent properties . See Eli Lilly , 471 F.3d at 1378 ; In re Lalu , 747 F.2d 703 , 707 ( Fed.Cir.1984 ) . Such properties may include positive attributes such as activity and potency , Altana , 566 F.3d at 1008 ; Eli Lilly , 471 F.3d at 1379 ; Yamanouchi , 231 F.3d at 1345 ; adverse effects such as toxicity , Takeda , 492 F.3d at 1358 , and other relevant characteristics in evidence , see Eisai , 533 F.3d at 1358 ( considering a prior art compound 's lipophilicity and low molecular weight ) ; Pfizer , Inc. v. Apotex , Inc. , 480 F.3d 1348 , 1363 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) ( considering the `` strength , solubility , and other known chemical characteristics '' of a prior art saltforming acid ) . Absent a reason or motivation based on such prior art evidence , mere structural similarity between a prior art compound and the claimed compound does not inform the lead compound selection . See Daiichi , 619 F.3d at 1354 ; In re Dillon , 919 F.2d 688 , 692 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) ( en banc ) ( `` [ S ] tructural similarity between claimed and prior art subject matter , proved by combining references or otherwise , where the prior art gives reason or motivation to make the claimed compositions , creates a prima facie case of obviousness . '' ( emphasis added ) ) . Were it otherwise , the analysis would impermissibly rely upon ex post reasoning . See KSR Int ' l Co. v. Teleflex , Inc. , 550 U.S. 398 , 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 , 167 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 2007 ) ( `` A factfinder should be aware , of course , of the distortion caused by hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The second inquiry in the analysis is whether the prior art would have supplied one of ordinary skill in the art with a reason or motivation to modify a lead compound to make the claimed compound with a reasonable expectation of success . Takeda , 492 F.3d at 1357 ( `` [ I ] n cases involving new chemical compounds , it remains necessary to identify some reason that would have led a chemist to modify a known compound in a particular manner to establish prima facie obviousness of a new claimed compound . `` ) ; Pfizer , 480 F.3d at 1361 ( `` [ T ] he challenger of the patent [ must ] show by clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention , and that the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so . `` ) ; Dillon , 919 F.2d at 692 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In keeping with the flexible nature of the obviousness inquiry , the reason or motivation for modifying a lead compound may come from any number of sources and need not necessarily be explicit in the prior art . Eisai , 533 F.3d at 1357 ( citing KSR , 550 U.S. at 415 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ) ; Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH v. Lupin , Ltd. , 499 F.3d 1293 , 1301 ( Fed.Cir.2007 ) . Again , pertinent properties guide the analysis , for `` it is the possession of promising useful properties in a lead compound *1293 that motivates a chemist to make structurally similar compounds . '' Daiichi , 619 F.3d at 1354 ( `` Potent and promising activity in the prior art trumps mere structural relationships . `` ) ; see also Eli Lilly , 471 F.3d at 1378 ( `` [ P ] atentability for a chemical compound does not depend only on structural similarity . `` ) ; In re Stemniski , 58 CCPA 1410 , 444 F.2d 581 , 586 ( 1971 ) . As we have explained , `` it is sufficient to show that the claimed and prior art compounds possess a 'sufficiently close relationship ... to create an expectation , ' in light of the totality of the prior art , that the new compound will have 'similar properties ' to the old . '' Aventis , 499 F.3d at 1301 ( quoting Dillon , 919 F.2d at 692 ) ; see also In re Wilder , 563 F.2d 457 , 460 ( CCPA 1977 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In the present case , in assessing whether aripiprazole would have been prima facie obvious in view of the prior art compounds asserted by the Defendants , the district court summarized the applicable law as requiring inquiry into _NEWLINE_ the hypothetical person of skill in the art 's identification of a lead compound , structural differences between the proposed lead compound and the claimed invention , motivation or teachings in the prior art to make the necessary changes to arrive at the claimed invention , and whether the person of skill in the art would have a reasonable expectation of success in making such structural changes . _NEWLINE_ Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *16 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *52-53 . We discern no error in the district court 's recitation of the applicable law . Moreover , the court did not require , as the Defendants allege , that only `` the most obvious choice '' could serve as the lead . Rather , the district court concluded that two compounds-clozapine and risperidone-would have been considered viable lead compounds . Id . at *23-24 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *76 . These were the only promising antipsychotic compounds at the time the present inventors began their work . They were the natural and obvious lead compounds whose structures one would have considered to modify to obtain improved antipsychotic compounds . At the relevant time , there were no carbostyril compounds that were marketed as antipsychotics or were publicly known to have potent antipsychotic activity with minimal side effects . Carbostyrils were thus not plausible lead compounds , except in retrospect , and the district court did not clearly err in concluding that they were not . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As for the Defendants ' purported lead compounds , the district court carefully considered each compound and correctly rejected the contention that a skilled artisan would have selected those compounds for further antipsychotic drug research efforts . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B . The Unsubstituted Butoxy Compound _NEWLINE_ In evaluating the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art , the district court first considered the unsubstituted butoxy compound disclosed in the prior art ¡¬416 patent and the Nakagawa declaration . The Defendants contend that the court erred by finding that a skilled artisan would not have selected the unsubstituted butoxy as a lead compound for antipsychotic drug discovery . We disagree . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As the court noted , the claims of the prior art ¡¬416 patent explicitly disclose the unsubstituted butoxy as producing an antihistaminic effect . This clear teaching controls over the far more nebulous disclosure that the trillions of carbostyril compounds encompassed by the ¡¬416 patent `` have antihistaminic and central nervous controlling effects . '' ¡¬416 patent col.2 ll.50-51 . As explained by Dr. Bryan Roth , whom the court credited as an expert in schizophrenia *1294 , antipsychotic drug discovery , and psychopharmacology , one of ordinary skill in the art would not have understood the ¡¬416 patent 's `` laundry list '' of potential central nervous system controlling effects to mean that every carbostyril derivative disclosed in the ¡¬416 patent is a potential antipsychotic . Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *8 , *10 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *26 , *31 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Nakagawa declaration similarly fails to support the Defendants ' contentions . As an initial matter , Otsuka argues in a footnote to its brief that the Nakagawa declaration is not eligible as prior art because the Defendants failed to prove that a chemist seeking to develop a new antipsychotic drug would have consulted the unindexed file history of the prior art ¡¬416 patent in the course of his or her research . Br . Pl.-Appellee Otsuka , at 24 n.1 . Arguments raised only in footnotes , however , are waived . SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp. , 439 F.3d 1312 , 1320 ( Fed.Cir.2006 ) . Although we may exercise our discretion to consider improperly raised arguments , we decline to do so here . See Becton Dickinson & Co. v. C.R . Bard , Inc. , 922 F.2d 792 , 800 ( Fed.Cir.1990 ) . We therefore assume , without deciding , that the Nakagawa declaration qualifies as prior art . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Although Nakagawa 's mouse jumping data `` could be indicative of potential antipsychotic activity to the skilled artisan , '' Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *10 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *34 , that alone does not resolve the matter . Rather , we must consider the contents of the declaration as a whole , as the district court correctly did . In doing so , we focus in particular on the compounds ' disclosed properties because , as the district court found , `` [ g ] enerally , a skilled artisan would be attracted to the most potent compounds in selecting a lead compound for development . '' Id . at *17 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *54 ; see also Daiichi , 619 F.3d at 1354 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Of the nine carbostyril test compounds for which the Nakagawa declaration supplied mouse jumping data , the unsubstituted butoxy was inferior to four other test compounds and thus `` was only of middling potency . '' Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *20 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *65 . Significantly , the four more potent test compounds were all propoxy-linked , including Compound 44 , which , with an ED 50 of 0.53 milligrams per kilogram , `` was by far the most potent of the compounds tested . '' Id . at *17 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *54 . One of the Defendants ' own experts conceded that the activity of Compound 44 was `` striking , '' and Dr. Roth testified that if a skilled artisan were to select any compound from the Nakagawa declaration , it would be Compound 44 . Id . at *17 , *17-18 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *54 , *56 . The Defendants do not allege obviousness over the structurally dissimilar Compound 44 , which , unlike aripiprazole , has a propoxy linker connected at the 5-position of its carbostyril core and a 2-ethoxy substituent on its phenyl ring . As the district court found , the Nakagawa declaration would , if anything , have taught one of ordinary skill to select a 5-linked propoxy carbostyril derivative as a lead compound . See id . at *18 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *57 ( comparing the ED 50 value of 2.1 for a 5-linked unsubstituted propoxy and the ED 50 value of 9.3 for a 7-linked unsubstituted propoxy and finding that this `` significant '' difference `` would teach the skilled artisan the superiority of 5-linked propoxy compounds over 7-linked propoxy compounds '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus , neither the ¡¬416 patent nor the Nakagawa declaration supports the Defendants ' position that one of ordinary skill would have selected the prior art unsubstituted *1295 butoxy compound as a lead compound for further antipsychotic research . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ C. The 2,3-Dichloro Propoxy Compound _NEWLINE_ According to the Defendants , the district court erred by failing to find that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the SE ¡¬945 application , which taught that the 2,3-dichloro propoxy compound had antipsychotic activity . We disagree . The Defendants ' argument `` strains the scope of the SE ¡¬945 application . '' Id . at *20 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *62 . As the district court correctly found , the SE ¡¬945 application lists the 2,3-dichloro propoxy compound `` as one among hundreds of examples that may be useful for an extensive list of potential central nervous system controlling activities , '' id. , and fails to tie the 2,3-dichloro propoxy to any meaningful suggestion of antipsychotic activity . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Defendants , citing Pfizer , 480 F.3d 1348 , allege that the SE ¡¬945 application 's generic disclosure `` is all that is required for obviousness . '' Br . Defs.-Appellants Apotex , at 37 . In Pfizer , this court held that the claimed amlodipine besylate salt would have been obvious in view of the known chemical structure of amlodipine and a prior art group of salt-forming anions including benzene sulphonate ( which combines with amlodipine to form the besylate salt ) . Pfizer , 480 F.3d at 1372 . This court premised its conclusion on findings that the prior art not only provided `` ample motivation to narrow the [ prior art ] genus of ... salt-forming anions ... to a few [ species ] , '' id . at 1363 , but also `` predicted the results , '' id . at 1367 . In the present case , in contrast to Pfizer , the Defendants failed to make an analogous showing . The district court thus correctly found that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected the 2,3-dichloro propoxy compound as a lead compound for further antipsychotic research . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Furthermore , as Otsuka points out , the Defendants ' theory that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the unsubstituted butoxy and the 2,3-dichloro propoxy rested in large part upon an asserted `` bracketing theory '' -i.e. , that one would have combined those two asserted compounds to arrive at aripiprazole , which shares some structural features of both . The district court found that the Defendants ' theory constituted `` an improper hindsight analysis . '' Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *20 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *64 . The Defendants do not on appeal challenge the district court 's finding or re-assert their bracketing theory . Accordingly , we conclude that the Defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the 2,3-dichloro propoxy . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ D. OPC-4392 _NEWLINE_ The Defendants also assert that the district court erred by rejecting OPC-4392 as a lead compound . Again , we disagree . The Defendants rely selectively on the disclosure in Murasaki 1987 that OPC-4392 was `` an antipsychotic drug , '' J.A . 5907 , and the fact that OPC-4392 proceeded to Phase II clinical trials . Taken as a whole , however , the prior art taught away from using OPC-4392 as a starting point for further antipsychotic research . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ For example , Murasaki 1987 teaches that `` the antipsychotic action [ of OPC-4392 ] was not strong . '' Id . Based on that teaching , together with other prior art of record that focuses only on the effects of OPC-4392 on schizophrenia 's negative symptoms , a skilled artisan would have concluded that OPC-4392 did not treat positive symptoms . Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *21-22 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *68-69 . The district court also credited the testimony of one of the Defendants ' witnesses , who stated that clinical *1296 studies of OPC-4392 showed that it `` lacked [ an ] antipsychotic component . '' Id . at *21 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *68 . Furthermore , Murasaki 1987 taught that `` the strength of the activating action [ of OPC-4392 ] stood out , '' J.A . 5907 , a property that Dr. Roth testified would have been a `` red flag '' indicating that the drug was likely to cause patients to act out on their delusions and hallucinations . Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *21-22 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *69 . Another prior art reference , Murasaki 1988 , taught that OPC-4392 , even at a `` very low dose , '' id . at *12 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *41 , caused `` severe '' side effects , J.A . 10401 . In light of the totality of the evidence before the district court , we perceive no clear error in the conclusion that OPC-4392 was `` considered a failure insofar as it did not treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and was not well-tolerated in modest doses . '' Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *22 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *70 . The court thus did not err in concluding that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected OPC-4392 as a lead compound for further antipsychotic research . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Even assuming that one would have selected OPC-4392 as a lead compound , the district court found that the Defendants failed to prove that the prior art would have directed one to make the various modifications necessary to convert OPC-4392 into aripiprazole . Those modifications include : ( 1 ) converting OPC-4392 's carbostyril core into a dihydrocarbostyril ; ( 2 ) changing OPC-4392 's propoxy linker to a butoxy ; and ( 3 ) replacing OPC-4392 's 2-methyl and 3-methyl groups with 2-chloro and 3-chloro substituents . On appeal , the Defendants rely in large part on the inventors ' and Otsuka 's own development efforts in an attempt to prove that aripiprazole would have been obvious . E.g. , Br . Defs.-Appellants Apotex , at 46-47 ( arguing that Otsuka 's aripiprazole development involved a `` short timeline '' and only `` took a few months '' ) . Those arguments can not trump the district court 's careful fact finding , however . The inventor 's own path itself never leads to a conclusion of obviousness ; that is hindsight . What matters is the path that the person of ordinary skill in the art would have followed , as evidenced by the pertinent prior art . See 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 ( a ) ( `` Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made . `` ) ; Life Techs. , Inc. v. Clontech Labs. , Inc. , 224 F.3d 1320 , 1325 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( `` [ T ] he path that leads an inventor to the invention is expressly made irrelevant to patentability by statute. '' ) . We therefore agree with the district court that the Defendants failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that the skilled artisan would have known how to modify OPC4392 to increase antipsychotic activity . Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *22 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *70 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ E. Conclusion _NEWLINE_ In summary , the district court 's careful analysis exposed the Defendants ' obviousness case for what it was-a poster child for impermissible hindsight reasoning . Because we agree with the district court that the Defendants failed to prove that claim 12 of the ¡¬528 patent would have been prima facie obvious over the asserted prior art compounds , we need not address the court 's findings regarding objective evidence of nonobviousness . In addition , because the Defendants ' arguments for obviousness of dependent claims 17 and 23 rely on a determination of obviousness for independent claim 12 , we need not separately analyze the court 's finding that the Defendants failed to prove invalidity for the asserted dependent claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ We now turn to the Defendants ' contention that the district court erred by *1297 failing to hold the asserted claims of the ¡¬528 patent invalid for nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting in view of the unsubstituted butoxy compound of claim 13 of the ¡¬416 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ An inventor may obtain `` a patent '' for an invention pursuant to 35 U.S.C . ¡± 101 ; the statute thus `` permits only one patent to be obtained for a single invention . '' In re Lonardo , 119 F.3d 960 , 965 ( Fed.Cir.1997 ) . The double patenting doctrine `` precludes one person from obtaining more than one valid patent for either ( a ) the 'same invention , ' or ( b ) an 'obvious ' modification of the same invention . '' Longi , 759 F.2d at 892 . Nonstatutory double patenting is a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy that `` prevent [ s ] the extension of the term of a patent , even where an express statutory basis for the rejection is missing , by prohibiting the issuance of the claims in a second patent not patentably distinct from the claims of the first patent . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As an initial matter , the parties disagree over the legal test for nonstatutory double patenting . Otsuka contends that there is no difference between obviousness under ¡± 103 and obviousness-type double patenting . That is not entirely correct . We have noted that `` a double patenting of the obviousness type rejection is analogous to [ a failure to meet ] the non-obviousness requirement of 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 . '' Id . at 892 n. 4 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) . Important differences remain , however . The patent principally underlying the double patenting rejection need not be prior art . Id . Moreover , when analyzing obviousness-type double patenting in cases involving claimed chemical compounds , the issue is not whether a skilled artisan would have selected the earlier compound as a lead compound . That is so because the analysis must necessarily focus on the earlier claimed compound over which double patenting has been alleged , lead compound or not . See Ortho Pharma . Corp. v. Smith , 959 F.2d 936 , 943 ( Fed.Cir.1992 ) ( `` [ I ] t is the claims that are compared when assessing double patenting. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Defendants assert that , unlike an analysis under ¡± 103 , the test for obviousness-type double patenting never asks whether the prior art would have supplied a motivation to modify the earlier claimed compound . That is also incorrect . Unless the earlier claim anticipates the later claim under ¡± 102 , the question whether the two claimed compounds are `` patentably distinct '' implicates the question of obviousness under ¡± 103 , Longi , 759 F.2d at 892 , which in the chemical context requires identifying some reason that would have led a chemist to modify the earlier compound to make the later compound with a reasonable expectation of success , see Takeda , 492 F.3d at 1357 , 1361 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Defendants rely on Geneva Pharm. , Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline PLC , 349 F.3d 1373 , 1377 n. 1 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) , which states in a footnote that `` [ o ] bviousness requires inquiry into a motivation to modify the prior art ; nonstatutory double patenting does not . '' Geneva , however , involved nonstatutory double patenting based on anticipation , not obviousness . Id . ( `` This genus-species relationship makes the claims patentably indistinct , because the earlier species ... anticipates the later genus ... . '' ) . For anticipation , of course , motivation in the prior art is unimportant . See , e.g. , Callaway Golf Co. v. Acushnet Co. , 576 F.3d 1331 , 1347 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( noting that , in an `` anticipation argument , ... motivation to combine is not an issue '' ) . The statement from Geneva was later recited in dictum in Procter & Gamble Co. v. Teva Pharm . USA , Inc. , 566 F.3d 989 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) , in which we concluded under ¡± 103 that there would have been no motivation *1298 to modify the prior art compound , id . at 995 , and then stated : `` Having concluded that [ the asserted compound ] was not obvious under 35 U.S.C . ¡± 103 , we similarly conclude that the [ asserted ] patent is not invalid for obviousness-type double patenting , '' id . at 999 ( emphasis added ) . Contrary to the Defendants ' arguments , neither Geneva nor Procter & Gamble stands for the proposition that , in considering whether one compound is an obvious variant of another for purposes of nonstatutory double patenting , analyzing the compound of the prior claim for a reason or motivation to modify is irrelevant . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We therefore reject the Defendants ' contention that the district court legally erred by relying in part on its findings under ¡± 103 in its subsequent double patenting analysis . The court in this case applied the correct test for nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting : In the context of claimed chemical compounds , an analysis of nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting-like an analysis under ¡± 103-entails determining , inter alia , whether one of ordinary skill in the art would have had reason or motivation to modify the earlier claimed compound to make the compound of the asserted claim with a reasonable expectation of success . There is no other way to consider the obviousness of compound B over compound A without considering whether one of ordinary skill would have had reason to modify A to make B . That is traditional obviousness analysis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Turning to the particulars of the district court 's decision on nonstatutory double patenting , the Defendants contend that the court improperly treated claim 13 of the ¡¬416 patent in isolation without considering prior art , such as the Nakagawa declaration , which would have taught a skilled artisan to substitute a phenyl ring with chlorine atoms at the 2- and 3-positions to make aripiprazole . Otsuka , in response , argues that the court , after considering the Nakagawa declaration in detail , correctly concluded that aripiprazole was not an obvious variant of the unsubstituted butoxy . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We agree with the district court that the asserted claims are not invalid for nonstatutory double patenting . As we explained above , aripiprazole differs structurally from the unsubstituted butoxy of claim 13 of the ¡¬416 patent . Aripiprazole has chlorine substituents at the 2 and 3 positions of its phenyl ring , whereas the unsubstituted butoxy has hydrogens at those positions-i.e. , it is `` unsubstituted . '' In its double patenting analysis , the court determined `` that the prior art , including the Nakagawa Declaration , ... did not teach the person of ordinary skill in the art to pursue a 2,3-dichloro substitution on the phenyl ring to achieve antipsychotic activity . '' Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *29 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *90-91 ; see also id . at *20 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *64 . The evidence before the district court supports this finding . For example , the court credited evidence demonstrating the high degree of unpredictability in antipsychotic drug discovery as of the priority date . Id . at *15 , *19 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 at *48 , *61 . Experts testified that the discovery of new antipsychotic drugs in the 1980s was `` very unpredictable , '' J.A . 30660 , and that antipsychotic research at that time was `` notoriously unsuccessful , '' J.A . 30453 . As KSR makes clear , predictability is a vital consideration in the obviousness analysis . 550 U.S. at 421 , 127 S.Ct . 1727 ; see also Procter & Gamble , 566 F.3d at 996 ( `` [ T ] o the extent an art is unpredictable , as the chemical arts often are , KSR 's focus on ... 'identified , predictable solutions ' may present a difficult hurdle because potential solutions are less likely to be genuinely predictable . '' ( quoting Eisai , 533 F.3d at 1359 ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1299 As the district court correctly held , the prior art would not have provided a skilled artisan with a reason to make the necessary structural changes to the unsubstituted butoxy to yield aripiprazole . Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *29 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *91 . The Defendants posit that substitution with chlorine atoms at the 2- and 3-positions of the phenyl ring `` would have been a logical and routine modification . '' Br . Defs.-Appellants Apotex , at 66 . The evidence indicates otherwise . The Nakagawa declaration neither disclosed nor would have suggested a 2,3-dichloro substituted antipsychotic compound . Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *19-20 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *62 ; J.A . 30689 . And , as we noted above , although other prior art including the SE ¡¬945 application disclosed 2,3-dichloro substituted compounds , those references failed to tie that disclosure to any meaningful suggestion of antipsychotic activity . Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *19-20 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *62 . As Dr. David Nichols , an expert in both medicinal chemistry and pharmacology , testified at trial : `` There was no known antipsychotic drug , successful or otherwise , that had those two particular [ chlorine ] substituents arranged in a 2,3 ... orientation , '' and , further , `` [ t ] here 's no teaching that suggests that a dichlorination pattern like that would lead to a safe atypical antipsychotic , or even an antipsychotic , period , atypical or otherwise . '' J.A . 30688-89 . In short , we perceive no clear error in the district court 's finding that one of ordinary skill would not have been motivated to pursue a 2,3-dichloro substitution on the phenyl ring as would have been required to convert the unsubstituted butoxy to aripiprazole . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Finally , the nonstatutory double patenting issue in this case is not , as the Defendants argue , controlled by In re Zickendraht , 50 CCPA 1529 , 319 F.2d 225 ( 1963 ) . In Zickendraht , one of our predecessor courts reviewed a decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ( the `` Board '' ) rejecting a claimed metalliferous azodyestuff compound for nonstatutory double patenting over a similar compound claimed in an issued patent . The two compounds were identical but for the presence or absence of a methyl group . Id . at 1534 , 319 F.2d 225 . In affirming the Board 's rejection , the Zickendraht court noted that `` [ i ] t has not been shown that this [ chemical ] difference has any effect on the dyeing characteristics of the compound . '' Id . at 1531 , 319 F.2d 225 . The court also pointed out that the earlier `` patent disclosure would suggest to one skilled in the art '' reacting particular starting components , which `` should result in production of the dye claimed '' in the pending application . Id . at 1532 , 319 F.2d 225 . Unlike in Zickendraht , the evidence here not only demonstrates the unpredictability of minor structural changes on a compound 's antipsychotic properties , but also indicates that the prior art would not have provided the skilled artisan with a reason to make the necessary structural changes to the unsubstituted butoxy to yield aripiprazole . Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *19 , *29 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *61 , *91 . Zickendraht , therefore , is distinguishable from the present case . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Because we agree with the district court that the prior art would not have provided one of ordinary skill with a reason or motivation to make aripiprazole from the unsubstituted butoxy compound , we need not examine Otsuka 's evidence of secondary considerations of nonobviousness . Moreover , the Defendants do not advance separate double patenting arguments for the asserted dependent claims of the ¡¬528 patent . We therefore conclude that the district court correctly determined that all of the asserted claims of the ¡¬528 patent are not invalid for nonstatutory obviousness-type *1300 double patenting over claim 13 of the ¡¬416 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ For the foregoing reasons , we affirm the judgment of the district court . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ AFFIRMED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 678 F.3d 1280 , 102 U.S.P.Q.2d 1729 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Defendants also asserted an ultimately unsuccessful inequitable conduct defense and counterclaim , which are not at issue on appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Elsewhere in its opinion the district court referred to Compound 39 as `` OPC-4139 . '' See Otsuka , 2010 WL 4596324 , at *13 , 2010 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 132595 , at *42 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Defendants-Appellants Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. submitted one set of appellate briefs addressing the issues of ¡± 103 obviousness and nonstatutory double patenting . Defendants-Appellants Teva Pharmaceuticals USA , Inc. , Barr Laboratories , Inc. , and Barr Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , submitted another set of briefs that addressed only nonstatutory double patenting , but joined in full the principal and reply briefs filed by Apotex . For purposes of this opinion we will refer to the arguments in both sets of briefs as the Defendants ' arguments . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_

The district court found that defendants infringed claims 34 and 51 of U.S. Patent No . 5,715,314 ( the `` ¡¬314 patent '' ) and claims 15 , 17 , and 39 of U.S. Patent No . 5,909,492 ( the `` ¡¬492 patent '' ) and that those claims were not invalid . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After the district court 's judgment , this court decided Soverain Software LLC v. Newegg Inc. , 705 F.3d 1333 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) , amended on reh ' g , 728 F.3d 1332 , 1336 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ( hereinafter `` Newegg `` ) . There , we held invalid as obvious claims 34 and 51 of the ¡¬314 patent and claims 17 , 41 , and 61 of the ¡¬492 patent . Id . at 1341 , 1344 . We hold that issue preclusion applies as a result of the Newegg case , and that the asserted claims here are therefore invalid . Accordingly , we reverse . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ BACKGROUND _NEWLINE_ Soverain Software LLC ( `` Soverain '' ) is the assignee of the ¡¬314 and ¡¬492 patents . It brought an infringement action against defendants in the Eastern District of Texas . The asserted claims fall into two categories . Claims 34 and 51 of the ¡¬314 patent and claim 17 of the ¡¬492 patent are directed to virtual shopping carts.1 Claims 15 and 39 of the ¡¬492 patent are directed to *1314 using a hypertext statement so that users can access information about past orders.2 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ On November 18 , 2011 , a jury determined that defendants infringed the asserted claims and that those claims were not invalid as anticipated or obvious . The district court subsequently entered judgment in favor of Soverain . Defendants appealed on September 7 , 2012 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Subsequent to the filing of the appeal , on January 22 , 2013 , this court decided Newegg , a case from the Eastern District of Texas in which Soverain also alleged infringement of the ¡¬314 and ¡¬492 patents . There , the district court had entered judgment that the asserted claims were infringed and not invalid . On appeal , we reversed , holding invalid as obvious claims 34 and 51 of the ¡¬314 patent and claims 17 , 41 , and 61 of the ¡¬492 patent . Newegg , 705 F.3d 1333 at 1347 . In a subsequent panel rehearing decision , we clarified that claim 35 is also invalid . We `` confirm [ ed ] that claim 34 is representative of the 'shopping cart ' claims , including claim 35 , and conclude [ d ] that dependent claim 35 is invalid on the ground of obviousness . '' Soverain Software LLC v. Newegg Inc. , 728 F.3d 1332 , 1336 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ( hereinafter `` Newegg II `` ) .3 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We apply the law of the regional circuit to the general procedural question of whether issue preclusion applies . RF Del. , Inc. v. Pac . Keystone Techs. , Inc. , 326 F.3d 1255 , 1261 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) . We apply this court 's precedent to questions involving substantive issues of patent law , issues of issue preclusion that implicate substantive patent law issues , or issues of issue preclusion that implicate the scope of our own previous decisions . Ohio Willow Wood Co. v. Alps S. , LLC , 735 F.3d 1333 , 1342 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ( citing Aspex Eyewear , Inc. v. Zenni Optical Inc. , 713 F.3d 1377 , 1380 ( Fed.Cir.2013 ) ) . `` [ T ] he issue of whether to apply collateral estoppel is a question of law , making our review de novo . '' Bradberry v. Jefferson Cnty. , Tex. , 732 F.3d 540 , 549 ( 5th Cir.2013 ) ( citation omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ I _NEWLINE_ The first question is whether issue preclusion , or collateral estoppel , should *1315 apply to claims 34 and 51 of the ¡¬314 patent and claims 15 and 17 of the ¡¬492 patent as a result of the Newegg judgment . `` Issue preclusion prohibits a party from seeking another determination of the litigated issue in the subsequent action . '' State Farm Mut . Auto . Ins . Co. v. LogistiCare Solutions , LLC , 751 F.3d 684 , 689 ( 5th Cir.2014 ) ( quoting United States v. Shanbaum , 10 F.3d 305 , 311 ( 5th Cir.1994 ) ) . The Fifth Circuit applies issue preclusion where the following four conditions are satisfied : _NEWLINE_ First , the issue under consideration in a subsequent action must be identical to the issue litigated in a prior action . Second , the issue must have been fully and vigorously litigated in the prior action . Third , the issue must have been necessary to support the judgment in the prior case . Fourth , there must be no special circumstance that would render preclusion inappropriate or unfair . _NEWLINE_ Id . ( quoting Shanbaum , 10 F.3d at 311 ) . Our own law is similar . Jet , Inc. v. Sewage Aeration Sys. , 223 F.3d 1360 , 1366 ( Fed.Cir.2000 ) ( issue preclusion requires four conditions : `` ( 1 ) identity of the issues in a prior proceeding ; ( 2 ) the issues were actually litigated ; ( 3 ) the determination of the issues was necessary to the resulting judgment ; and , ( 4 ) the party defending against preclusion had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues '' ( citations omitted ) ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In Newegg , we explicitly held that claims 34 and 51 of the ¡¬314 patent and claim 17 of the ¡¬492 patent were obvious . 705 F.3d at 1341 . Although claim 15 of the ¡¬492 patent , at issue here , was not explicitly invalidated in Newegg , we invalidated claim 41 , which depends from claim 15 . Id . at 1344 . Therefore , the invalidity determination as to claim 41 extended to claim 15 , as well . See Callaway Golf Co. v. Acushnet Co. , 576 F.3d 1331 , 1344 ( Fed.Cir.2009 ) ( `` A broader independent claim can not be nonobvious where a dependent claim stemming from that independent claim is invalid for obviousness . '' ) ( citation omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The Supreme Court has held that a defense of issue preclusion applies where a party is `` facing a charge of infringement of a patent that has once been declared invalid , '' even though the party asserting the defense was not a party to the action where the patent was invalidated . Blonder-Tongue Labs. , Inc. v. Univ . of Ill . Found. , 402 U.S. 313 , 349-50 , 91 S.Ct . 1434 , 28 L.Ed.2d 788 ( 1971 ) . We have similarly held that `` once the claims of a patent are held invalid in a suit involving one alleged infringer , an unrelated party who is sued for infringement of those claims may reap the benefit of the invalidity decision under principles of collateral estoppel . '' Mendenhall v. Barber-Greene Co. , 26 F.3d 1573 , 1577 ( Fed.Cir.1994 ) ; see In re Cygnus Telecomms . Tech. , LLC , Patent Litig. , 536 F.3d 1343 , 1349 ( Fed.Cir.2008 ) ; Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. v. Mylan Pharm. , Inc. , 170 F.3d 1373 , 1379 ( Fed.Cir.1999 ) . It is also established that issue preclusion applies even though the precluding judgment ( Newegg ) comes into existence while the case as to which preclusion is sought ( this case ) is on appeal . Mendenhall , 26 F.3d at 1583-84 ( invalidity decision rendered while case on appeal ) ; Dana Corp. v. NOK , Inc. , 882 F.2d 505 , 508 ( Fed.Cir.1989 ) ( invalidity decision at Federal Circuit issued while case being briefed on appeal ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ As to the four claims listed above , Soverain agrees that issue preclusion would normally be applicable but argues that it should not apply here because Soverain has not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of obviousness . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Under issue preclusion law generally and under both our law and Fifth Circuit law , a judgment of invalidity will not have a preclusive effect if a patentee *1316 can demonstrate that it did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue . Blumcraft of Pittsburgh v. Kawneer Co. , 482 F.2d 542 , 546-47 ( 5th Cir.1973 ) ; see Blonder-Tongue , 402 U.S. at 333 , 91 S.Ct . 1434 ( a patentee `` must be permitted to demonstrate , if he can , that he did not have ' a fair opportunity procedurally , substantively and evidentially to pursue his claim the first time ' `` ( citation omitted ) ) ; Pharmacia , 170 F.3d at 1379 ( `` [ A ] judgment of invalidity will have no collateral estoppel effect if the patentee can show that it did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate . `` ) ; Restatement ( Second ) of Judgments ¡± 28 ( 5 ) ( 1982 ) ( a party is not precluded where `` the party sought to be precluded , as a result of the conduct of his adversary or other special circumstances , did not have an adequate opportunity or incentive to obtain a full and fair adjudication in the initial action '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We need not here review the various grounds that are relevant to whether a party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate because most are inapplicable here . See generally Blonder-Tongue , 402 U.S. at 332-34 , 91 S.Ct . 1434 ; Restatement ( Second ) of Judgments ¡±¡± 28 , 29 . For example , the issue of incentive to litigate arises where `` [ t ] he stakes in the first action may be so small that extensive effort is not reasonable if the risk is limited to the first action . '' 18 Charles Alan Wright , Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper , Federal Practice & Procedure ¡± 4423 ( 2d ed.2002 ) . That circumstance does not exist here . Soverain does not dispute that it was represented by distinguished counsel in that appeal and that the amount in controversy was significant . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The unusual full and fair opportunity argument made here requires an understanding of the appeal in Newegg . In the district court in Newegg , at the close of evidence , Soverain and the defendant Newegg Inc. ( `` Newegg '' ) filed cross-motions for judgment as a matter of law ( `` JMOL '' ) ; the district court granted Soverain 's JMOL motion of non-obviousness and denied Newegg 's JMOL motion of obviousness . See Newegg , 705 F.3d at 1336 . As a result of the grant of Soverain 's motion , the jury did not address obviousness . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ After the jury 's verdict , the district court denied Newegg 's renewed JMOL motion and alternative motion for a new trial . Id . Newegg appealed from the district court 's judgment of non-obviousness . Id . While Newegg had preserved in the district court the argument that it should have been granted JMOL on the issue of obviousness , on appeal Newegg explicitly argued only that the district court erred in granting JMOL for Soverain on the issue of non-obviousness and in not granting Newegg 's motion for a new trial.4 See id . Newegg also requested `` any other and further relief to which it may be justly entitled . '' J.A . 37701 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We acknowledged that Newegg on appeal had argued only for a new trial but noted that , `` [ h ] owever , questions of law must be correctly decided ... . '' Newegg , 705 F.3d at 1337 . On `` th [ o ] se premises , we determine [ d ] the question of obviousness . '' *1317 Id . The primary evidence before us in Newegg regarding invalidity was the `` CompuServe Mall '' system , a prior electronic commerce system , including two books describing the system which disclosed the use of electronic shopping carts . Id . at 1337-38 , 1340-41 , 1343-44 . Soverain 's arguments for nonobviousness relied on features that were either `` not embodied in the claims and not reflected in the claim construction , '' id . at 1339 ; see id . at 1341 , or related to incorporation of known internet technology , id . at 1340 , 1343-44 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Soverain petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en banc . Soverain argued that the court improperly ordered JMOL when , on appeal , Newegg had asked only for a new trial . Additionally , Soverain and Newegg both noted that claim 35 of the ¡¬ 314 patent had not been addressed in our decision , even though it had been included in the district court 's judgment of no invalidity . We subsequently granted panel rehearing and , after considering supplemental briefing and arguments , `` confirm [ ed ] that claim 34 is representative of the 'shopping cart ' claims , including claim 35 , and conclude [ d ] that dependent claim 35 is invalid on the ground of obviousness . '' Newegg II , 728 F.3d at 1336 . We implicitly rejected the patentee 's argument that the court should have granted a new trial rather than JMOL , id. , implicitly rejecting the idea that Soverain did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate . Rehearing en banc was denied . Soverain Software LLC v. Newegg Inc. , No . 2011-1009 ( Fed.Cir . Sept. 4 , 2013 ) ( order denying en banc rehearing ) . Soverain 's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court was denied . Soverain Software LLC v. Newegg Inc. , -- - U.S. -- -- , 134 S.Ct . 910 , 187 L.Ed.2d 779 ( 2014 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ We note that Soverain does not argue that it was deprived of crucial evidence or witnesses in the first litigation or that it would present additional evidence at a new trial . See Blonder-Tongue , 402 U.S. at 333 , 91 S.Ct . 1434 . Nor is there any contention that Soverain did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the question of obviousness at the district court . Rather , Soverain 's argument is that it did not have the incentive to fully litigate the issue of non-obviousness on appeal.5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Specifically , Soverain contends that it would have raised different or additional arguments on appeal if it had known that this court might reverse the district court on invalidity rather than only granting a new trial . But Soverain does not cite any case to support the notion that a full and fair opportunity to litigate is lacking where a party might have argued differently on appeal . In Newegg , the same basic issue of obviousness was central whether the focus was on insufficiency of the evidence as a ground for JMOL or on insufficiency of the evidence as a ground for a new trial . Not surprisingly , Soverain has not identified any significant new arguments that were not in fact raised in the earlier appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ With respect to the shopping cart patents ( claims 34 and 51 of the ¡¬ 314 patent and claim 17 of the ¡¬492 patent ) , Soverain argues that it did not have a full and fair *1318 opportunity to present its arguments in Newegg that `` product identifiers , '' a limitation in each of the asserted claims , distinguish the prior art CompuServe Mall system . Basically , a product identifier identifies which product a user has placed in a shopping cart.6 See ¡¬314 patent col. 3 ll . 45-47 , col. 5 ll . 29-30 , col. 14 ll . 9-10 . But Soverain presented the same arguments about product identifiers in Newegg that it puts forward here . Here , Soverain points to expert testimony to argue that the CompuServe Mall system did not utilize product identifiers because that system was a single computer system that always recognized the identity of the user and which product the user was viewing . Similarly , in Newegg , Soverain contended that `` Newegg 's fact witness , Mr. Trevor , testified that the CompuServe Mall did not employ product identifiers , and was therefore not programmed to send shopping cart messages ... each of which comprises a product identifier . '' Brief of Plaintiff-Appellee Soverain Software LLC at 45 , Newegg , 705 F.3d 1333 ( No . 2011-1009 ) ( alterations in original ) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) . Soverain argued that , `` [ a ] s Soverain 's expert , Dr. Shamos , explained , the basic architecture of the CompuServe Mall was specifically designed so that the system would be able to ascertain which products the customer had selected for purchase without the use of a separate product identifier . '' Id . ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) . This court in Newegg considered and rejected Soverain 's arguments about the product identifier . We discussed the testimony by Soverain 's expert that the CompuServe system lacked the product identifier limitation and rejected the expert 's conclusions . Newegg , 705 F.3d at 1339-40 . We found that `` [ t ] he product identifier message term does not distinguish the shopping cart claims from the prior art CompuServe Mall . '' Id . at 1340 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Soverain also argues that it did not have the opportunity in Newegg to present its arguments that the confirmation numbers from the CompuServe Mall system did not satisfy the limitations of the hypertext statement claims ( claims 15 and 39 of the ¡¬492 patent ) . Soverain argues that its expert testimony established that the CompuServe system did not provide online access to information or suggest providing hyperlinked transaction documents , as required by the claims . But Soverain made this same argument in its Newegg briefing , stating that `` [ t ] he CompuServe Mall did not have the capability for customers to review their order status or transaction history online . '' Brief of Plaintiff-Appellee Soverain Software LLC at 46 , Newegg , 705 F.3d 1333 ( No . 2011-1009 ) . In Newegg , we addressed Soverain 's argument that , in the `` CompuServe Mall [ , ] it might be necessary to resort to the telephone or email to get the transaction information ... . '' 705 F.3d at 1343 . We reasoned that the patentee `` did not invent the Internet , or hypertext , or the URL ... . [ T ] he use of hypertext to communicate ' a statement document ' or 'transaction detail document ' was a routine incorporation of Internet technology into existing processes . '' Id . at 1344 ( citations omitted ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Soverain further argues that it did not focus on the credibility of Newegg 's expert witness `` because Soverain was seeking to affirm JMOL of non-obviousness by relying on [ Newegg 's expert 's ] failure to establish that certain claim elements were prima facie present . '' Appellee 's Br . 29 . Specifically , Soverain argues that it would have presented evidence that Newegg 's expert , Mr. Tittel , was discredited on cross-examination because he admitted that he did not conduct an element-by-element *1319 comparison of the claims to the prior art , apply the district court 's claim construction , or review the prosecution history of the patents . But Soverain did have the incentive to raise these arguments in the Newegg appeal . The district court had issued JMOL for Soverain , having found that Newegg failed to present a prima facie case of obviousness . Newegg , 705 F.3d at 1337 . On appeal , the question was whether JMOL was inappropriate because Tittel 's testimony established a prima facie case of obviousness , as Newegg argued . See id . We concluded that Tittel 's testimony established that each element of the claims was present in the CompuServe system and relied on that testimony . Id . at 1338 , 1342-43 . Soverain did have the incentive to argue that Tittel 's testimony did not support Newegg 's obviousness arguments because Mr. Tittel , for example , did not conduct an element-by-element analysis . The fact that Soverain had arguments which it did not make does not mean that Soverain lacked the incentive to make them . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ II _NEWLINE_ The remaining question is whether issue preclusion applies to invalidate claim 39 ( a hypertext statement claim ) of the ¡¬492 patent . Claim 39 depends from claim 15 . Claim 15 was invalidated as obvious in Newegg . See Newegg , 705 F.3d at 1344 ( invalidating as obvious claim 41 , which depends from claim 15 ) . The only additional limitation in claim 39 concerns the Internet . Claim 39 recites `` [ a ] hypertext statement in accordance with claim 15,7 wherein the network is an Internet . '' ¡¬492 patent Reexamination Certificate C1 col. 1 ll . 21-22 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Soverain argues that issue preclusion should not apply because claim 39 was not previously found obvious and does not present identical issues . Complete identity of claims is not required to satisfy the identity-of-issues requirement for claim preclusion . Ohio Willow Wood , 735 F.3d at 1342 ; see Aspex v. Marchon Eyewear , Inc. , 672 F.3d 1335 , 1341 ( 2012 ) ( in the claim preclusion context ) . `` If the differences between the unadjudicated patent claims and adjudicated patent claims do not materially alter the question of invalidity , collateral estoppel applies . '' Ohio Willow Wood , 735 F.3d at 1342 ( citing Bourns , Inc. v. United States , 537 F.2d 486 , 493 ( Ct.Cl.1976 ) ) . In Ohio Willow Wood , we applied issue preclusion to invalidate a claim where a different claim in another patent had previously been invalidated because `` the [ ] patents use [ d ] slightly different language to describe substantially the same invention . '' Id . We also found that a difference in claim scope was not fatal to the application of estoppel . Id . at 1343 . The previously-invalidated claim contained a limitation requiring only polymeric gel , whereas the unadjudicated claim required , more specifically , block copolymer gel . Id . We held that , because the patentee failed to explain how the additional limitation would change an invalidity analysis , the patentee had not met its burden in opposing summary judgment . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The additional limitation here-transmitting a hypertext statement over the Internet , rather than over a generic network-does not materially alter the question of the validity of claim 39 . In Newegg , as to the hypertext statement claims , the court noted that Newegg 's expert Tittel had testified that CompuServe was not on the Internet . Newegg , 705 F.3d at 1343 . We explained that , as conceded by Soverain 's expert Shamos , the patentee `` did not invent the Internet , or hypertext , or the URL . '' Id . at 1344 ( citing Shamos testimony ) . `` [ T ] he use of hypertext to [ perform the limitations of the hypertext *1320 statement claims ] was a routine incorporation of Internet technology into existing processes . '' Id . ( citations omitted ) . Here , too , the routine incorporation of Internet technology in claim 39 does not change the invalidity analysis . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The invalidity of the asserted claims of the ¡¬314 and ¡¬492 patents is established by issue preclusion .

However , `` although claim 34 was the subject of litigation of the shopping cart claims , the district court 's judgment referred to claim 35 , not claim 34 . This court granted rehearing , to assure that the claims at issue in th [ e ] litigation were adequately and fairly assessed at trial and on appeal . '' Newegg II , 728 F.3d at 1333 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 4 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Newegg was thus unlike Unitherm Food Systems , Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich , Inc. , 546 U.S. 394 , 398 , 126 S.Ct . 980 , 163 L.Ed.2d 974 ( 2006 ) ( holding `` that since respondent failed to renew its preverdict motion as specified in Rule 50 ( b ) , there was no basis for review of respondent 's sufficiency of the evidence challenge in the Court of Appeals '' ) . The Supreme Court has recognized that , under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 , a court of appeals can direct entry of judgment in cases where the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged , and a JMOL motion was made in the district court . See Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr . Co. , 386 U.S. 317 , 328-30 , 87 S.Ct . 1072 , 18 L.Ed.2d 75 ( 1967 ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 5 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Soverain also argues that it lacked the ability to appeal our judgment in Newegg , under the exception to preclusion which applies where a party `` could not , as a matter of law , have obtained review of the judgment in the initial action . '' Restatement ( Second ) of Judgments ¡± 28 ( 1 ) . But the ability to appeal generally concerns the ability to appeal from the court of first instance ( here , the district court ) . And here , Soverain petitioned for rehearing and to the Supreme Court for certiorari . The ability to appeal exception `` applies only when review is precluded as a matter of law .

Following the district court 's claim construction , Inline moved for entry of final judgment of non-infringement of its ¡¬003 patent , on the premise that the claims as construed are not infringed . Inline also granted EasyPak a covenant not to sue on the ¡¬680 patent . The district court then entered final judgment of non-infringement of the ¡¬003 patent , dismissed without prejudice EasyPak 's declaratory judgment counterclaims for invalidity , and dismissed Inline 's count for infringement of the ¡¬680 patent with prejudice.1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Inline appeals the district court 's construction of the claims of the ¡¬003 patent , stating that the terms `` frangible section '' and `` tamper evident bridge '' were incorrectly construed . We conclude that , on the facts and specification of the ¡¬003 patent , the district court erred in limiting the claims to a specific embodiment , for the invention as claimed is supported by the patent 's broader disclosure . We vacate the judgment of non-infringement of the ¡¬003 patent , and remand for determination of infringement in accordance with the corrected claim construction . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ THE ¡¬003 PATENT _NEWLINE_ The patented products are plastic food containers having the described tamper-evident and tamper-resistant features . The containers have a hinged plastic bridge between the top and bottom portions of the container , the bridge having a frangible section that must be severed in order to open the container . Thus , tampering or opening of the container is readily evident . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Figure 1 of the ¡¬003 patent shows an embodiment of the tamper-resistant container , having a cover portion 12 and a base portion 14 joined by a hinge 16 . The hinge includes a tamper-evident pull strip 18 , which upon removal severs the connection between cover 12 and base 14 : _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ *1367 The parties agree that claims 1 and 2 are representative : _NEWLINE_ 1 . A tamper-resistant/evident container comprising : _NEWLINE_ a ) a plastic , transparent cover portion including an outwardly extending peripheral flange ; _NEWLINE_ b ) a base portion including an upper peripheral edge forming at least in part an upwardly projecting bead extending substantially about the perimeter of the base portion and configured to render the outwardly extending flange of the cover portion relatively inaccessible when the container is closed ; and _NEWLINE_ c ) a tamper evident bridge connecting the cover portion to the base portion . _NEWLINE_ 2 . A tamper-resistant/evident container as recited in claim 1 , wherein the tamper evident bridge includes a hinge joining the outwardly extending flange of the cover portion with the base portion , the hinge including a frangible section , which upon severing , provides a projection that extends out beyond the upwardly projecting bead of the upper peripheral edge of the base portion , for facilitating removal of the cover portion from the base portion to open the container . _NEWLINE_ EasyPak 's accused containers embody all of the elements of claims 1 and 2 . However , the EasyPak frangible section has a single score line along which the cover is severed from the base , whereas the ¡¬003 patent 's preferred embodiment , as shown in Figure 1 , has two score lines at the frangible section . The district court construed `` frangible section '' to mean `` a removable tear strip , delimited by at least two severable score lines . '' Inline Plastics Corp. v. EasyPak , LLC , No . 11-cv-11470-TSH , 2013 WL 2395998 , at *10 ( D.Mass . Jan. 22 , 2013 ) ( `` Claim Construction Order '' ) . _NEWLINE_ The district court acknowledged that it limited the claims to the embodiment shown in Figure 1 , and stated that `` declarations made during patent prosecution to surpass the prior art reveal a definitive focus on the removability of the frangible *1368 section and thus clearly and unambiguously disavow any other embodiment to the contrary . '' Claim Construction Order , at *6 . The district court recognized that claims 1 and 2 did not contain a limitation to two severable score lines , but reasoned that the prosecution history supported this limitation . That is the issue on appeal . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ DISCUSSION _NEWLINE_ The district court 's claim construction is reviewed as set forth in Teva Pharmaceuticals USA , Inc. v. Sandoz , Inc. , -- - U.S. -- -- , 135 S.Ct . 831 , -- - L.Ed.2d -- -- ( 2015 ) . `` [ W ] hen the district court reviews only evidence intrinsic to the patent ( the patent claims and specifications , along with the patent 's prosecution history ) , the judge 's determination will amount solely to a determination of law , and the Court of Appeals will review that construction de novo . '' Id . at 841 . Relevant factual determinations based on extrinsic evidence , such as prior art and expert testimony , are reviewed under the standard of clear error . Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ A _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ FRANGIBLE SECTION _NEWLINE_ Applying these criteria , Inline argues that `` frangible section '' was incorrectly construed as requiring at least two score lines at the hinge . Inline states that `` frangible section '' should be construed to mean a `` section of material that includes at least one score line or at least one perforation line . '' Inline points out that nothing in the specification , the prosecution history , or the prior art limits `` frangible section '' by the number of score lines by which the frangible section is severed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The ¡¬003 specification describes the invention 's features as `` intended to prevent and deter opening container 10 without first removing frangible strip 18 from hinge 16 . '' ¡¬003 Patent , col.5 ll.65-67 . The specification describes the preferred embodiment as : _NEWLINE_ Preferably , frangible strip 18 is limited at least in part by a pair of parallel score lines 42 a , 42 b or areas that have been weakened or stressed during the forming process . _NEWLINE_ Id . at col.6 ll.24-26 . The specification also states that a single score line or perforation is an alternative embodiment : _NEWLINE_ Alternatively , the integral hinge 16 could be formed with a single score line or perforation line , rather than a pair of score lines . In this instance , the single score line could be severed to create a pair of projections which would be used to open the container . _NEWLINE_ Id . at col.6 ll.33-37 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Despite this explicit disclosure of an alternative single score line , the district court limited `` frangible section '' to require at least two score lines . No prior art or prosecution argument underlays this limitation . The district court referred only to the frequency with which the specification described the frangible section as having two score lines that form a severable strip . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Here , the preferred embodiment is not described as having certain unique characteristics of patentable distinction from other disclosed embodiments . Nor are other embodiments inadequately described in relation to the principles of the invention . Absent such traditional aspects of restrictive claim construction , the patentee is entitled to claim scope commensurate with the invention that is described in the specification . See Phillips v. AWH Corp. , 415 F.3d 1303 , 1313 ( Fed.Cir.2005 ) *1369 ( `` [ A ] lthough the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention , we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ EasyPak states that the prosecution history supports construction of `` frangible section '' to require at least two score lines . This argument is devoid of support in the prosecution history . The examiner did not require such limitation , and it was not a condition of patentability . There is no prosecution history disclaimer , which requires clear and deliberate disavowal . See , e.g. , Omega Eng ' g , Inc. v. Raytek Corp. , 334 F.3d 1314 , 1325 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ; Storage Tech . Corp. v. Cisco Sys. , Inc. , 329 F.3d 823 , 833 ( Fed.Cir.2003 ) ( `` We therefore do not consider the applicants ' statement to be a clear and unambiguous disavowal of claim scope as required to depart from the meaning of the term provided by the written description. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ During prosecution , the examiner initially rejected claims 1 and 2 as anticipated by either of U.S. Patent No . 5,507,406 ( Urciuoli ) or German Patent DE 7816353 ( Menshen ) , and rejections on the ground of obviousness were based on these references and also in view of U.S. Patent No . 4,535,889 ( Terauds ) . In response , Inline emphasized that no reference showed a frangible section which , upon severing , `` provides a projection that extends out beyond the upwardly projecting bead of the upper peripheral edge of the base portion for facilitating removal of the cover portion from the base portion to open the container . '' App . No . 10/895,687 , Amendment and Response 15 ( Jan. 17 , 2006 ) . Inline described Urciuoli 's frangible section as `` a perforated line , a groove or the like around the receptacle 210 in the outer segment 222 . '' Id . at 9 . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ EasyPak states that Inline distinguished its invention from Urciuoli on the basis that Urciuoli 's frangible section features a single perforated line . We can not find such a statement in either the reference or the prosecution history . Inline 's description of Uricuoli as containing a `` perforated line , a groove or the like , '' was not the basis of Inline 's distinction . To the contrary , Inline distinguished its invention from Urciuoli on the basis that `` [ n ] owhere in [ Urciuoli ] is there any disclosure , teaching or suggestion to modify the container therein to provide a tamper evident bridge that connects a cover portion to a base portion . '' Id . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ ? _NEWLINE_ *1370 As depicted in Urciuoli Figure 2 , the lid 250 nests within the edge or lip 222 of the container portion 210 . The frangible breakpoint 235 in Urciuoli is located in this lip section that lies around the container . To open the container of Urciuoli , a user applies pressure to a handle 215 on the container portion , breaks the frangible section , and lifts the lid portion out from its nesting position in the container portion . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The device of the ¡¬003 patent , unlike that of Urciuoli , has a hinge formed by outwardly extending edges on both the cover and base portions . The distinction between Urciuoli and the ¡¬003 device has no relation to the number of score lines on a tear strip , but rather to differences in the structure and opening mechanism as a whole . The Urciuoli structure indeed shows when tampering has occurred , but by a different mechanism . The number of score lines in the frangible lip of Urciuoli is not part of the tamper-evidencing mechanism . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ EasyPak also argues that the declarations that Inline submitted to the PTO limit the claims to a tear strip having two score lines . That is an inaccurate description of the declarations . Inline submitted a declaration of Edward Colombo , a Director on Inline 's Board , who described Inline 's commercially successful containers as having a frangible hinge with a removable tear strip . App . No . 10/895,687 , Decl . of Edward A. Colombo 4 ( Jan. 17 , 2006 ) . His statements describe the commercial embodiments and focused on the long-felt need met by Inline 's commercial products : _NEWLINE_ The containers disclosed in this patent application meet the long-felt needs identified above because they utilize a geometry that is suitable for thermoforming containers from a sheet of plastic material . Even more importantly , the containers disclosed herein can be thermoformed from a single piece of material , such as a single sheet of plastic . This material can be transparent . One of the structural features of the container that makes this single piece formation possible is the skirt that depends down from the peripheral rim of the container . This skirt is formed to have a vertical height that directly correlates with the height of a frangible hinge that includes a tear strip . _NEWLINE_ *1371 Id . Mr. Colombo did not address the number of score lines in the frangible section . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ In correspondence with the PTO , Inline discussed the advantages of its structure . Inline explained that by having a `` cover that is very difficult to open without removing the tamper-evident bridge connecting the cover to the base portion , pilferage is substantially reduced . '' App . No . 10/895,687 , Supplemental Response 3 ( Mar . 3 , 2006 ) . Inline also filed a declaration of its Vice President of Sales , August Lanzetta , and a statement from a customer , Arcade Industries , Inc . Both Mr. Lanzetta and Arcade Industries describe the Inline containers as featuring removable tear strips . Those declarations , like that of Mr. Colombo , focused on the commercial success of Inline 's product , not the scope of the claims . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ The patent examiner placed no emphasis on the number of severable lines . In allowing the claims , the examiner explained : `` The container also includes a tamper evident feature , such as a tear strip , connecting the cover portion to the base portion . '' App . No . 10/895,687 , Final Rejection 2 ( June 19 , 2006 ) . There is no discussion in the specification or the prosecution history of any patentability reliance on the number of score lines by which the frangible section is severed . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus Inline proposes that the correct construction of `` frangible section '' is `` a section of material that includes at least one score line or at least one perforation line , '' and refers to the doctrine of claim differentiation . See Phillips , 415 F.3d at 1315 ( `` [ T ] he presence of a dependent claim that adds a particular limitation gives rise to a presumption that the limitation in question is not present in the independent claim. '' ) . Claim 2 of the ¡¬003 patent , recited ante , includes the frangible limitation : _NEWLINE_ the hinge including a frangible section , which upon severing , provides a projection ... for facilitating removal of the cover portion from the base portion to open the container . _NEWLINE_ Claim 4 depends from claim 2 and is specific to the embodiment of two parallel score lines : _NEWLINE_ 4 . A tamper-resistant/evident container as recited in claim 2 , wherein the frangible section of the hinge is delimited at least in part by a pair of parallel score lines . _NEWLINE_ Since the specification explicitly mentions the `` alternative '' of `` a single score line or perforation line , rather than a pair of score lines , '' col.6 ll.33-37 , there can be no debate concerning the application of the doctrine of claim differentiation , see Tandon Corp. v. U.S. Int ' l Trade Comm ' n , 831 F.2d 1017 , 1023 ( Fed.Cir.1987 ) ( `` There is presumed to be a difference in meaning and scope when different words or phrases are used in separate claims. '' ) . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Thus we correct the district court 's claim construction , and construe `` frangible section '' to mean `` a section of material that includes at least one score line or at least one perforation line . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ B _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ TAMPER EVIDENT BRIDGE _NEWLINE_ The term `` tamper evident bridge '' was not in the ¡¬003 specification as filed . It was added to the claims during prosecution to distinguish the Urciuoh reference . When the term was added , Inline explained that Urciuoh does not show a tamper evident bridge that connects the cover to the base , and that the container in Urciuoh would have to be completely redesigned to accommodate the tamper evident bridge structure of the ¡¬003 patent . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ *1372 The district court construed the term `` tamper evident bridge '' to mean `` a structure that connects the lid and base portions of the container and also contains a removable tear strip , delimited by at least two severable score lines , which once removed provides evidence that tampering has occurred . '' Claim Construction Order , at *10 . Except for the limitation of two score lines , which derives from the district court 's construction of `` frangible section , '' we discern no error in this construction . Thus we reconstruct `` at least two '' in the Claim Construction Order to `` at least one . '' _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ CONCLUSION _NEWLINE_ We have corrected the claim construction , whereby claims 1 and 2 are not restricted to the presence of at least two score lines or perforation lines . On this claim construction , the judgment of non-infringement of the ¡¬003 patent can not stand . We vacate that judgment , and remand for further proceedings based on the correct claim construction as set forth herein . _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ REVERSED IN PART , VACATED IN PART , AND REMANDED _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ All Citations _NEWLINE_ 799 F.3d 1364 , 116 U.S.P.Q.2d 1418 _NEWLINE_ Footnotes _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ 1 _NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_ Inline Plastics Corp. v.
