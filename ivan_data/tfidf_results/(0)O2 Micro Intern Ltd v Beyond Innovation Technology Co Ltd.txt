BIG_TOKEN__¡¬615_patent__BIG_TOKEN 's Figure 2 The converter_circuit uses a feedback_control_loop ( 40 ) to affect the switches ' ON_times .
7.708799
To the feedback_control_loop , the converter_circuit provides a feedback_signal ( FB ) indicative of the total_current ( and , thus , power ) at the load and a reference_voltage ( REF ) indicative of the desired load conditions ( for example , the desired total_current at the load ) .
6.944150
As issued , it requires , in relevant part , a DC/AC_converter_circuit comprising : a feedback_control_loop_circuit receiving a feedback_signal indicative of power being supplied to said load , and adapted to generate a second signal pulse signal for controlling the conduction_state of said second plurality of switches only if said feedback_signal is above a predetermined threshold ; '615 patent col. 10 l.67-col. 11 l.5 .
6.905434
If a pair of switches along a conduction path are ON simultaneously , the circuit will deliver more power to the load .
