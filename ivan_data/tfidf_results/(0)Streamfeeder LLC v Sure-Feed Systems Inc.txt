An apparatus for serially feeding sheets in a forward_direction from the bottom of a generally vertical_stack of such_sheets comprising : *976 means for supporting the generally vertical_stack of sheets and so that the stack defines a forward_side composed of aligned forward_edges of the sheets , and a bottom , said supporting means including endless_belt means and means rotatably mounting said endless_belt means so as to have an upper_run positioned to extend across the bottom of said stack ; drive means for rotating said endless_belt so that said upper_run moves in the forward_direction ; and means including a stationary gate forming member positioned above said upper_run of said belt means and adjacent the forward_side of said stack and so as to define a nip which forms a gap between said gate forming member and said upper_run , for permitting the lowermost_sheet of the stack to pass forwardly from the stack through said nip , said gate forming member including first_surface means facing toward forward_side of said stack so as to engage the forward_edges of the sheets in the stack , and second_surface means at said nip and having a coefficient of friction which is higher than that of said first_surface means , and such that the lowermost_sheet is free to pass through said nip without significant frictional resistance while the sheet immediately above the lowermost_sheet is retarded in moving through said gap by its frictional engagement with said second_surface means .
