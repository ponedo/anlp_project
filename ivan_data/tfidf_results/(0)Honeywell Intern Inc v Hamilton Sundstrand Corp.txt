A method of utilizing a compressor of a gas_turbine_engine to power pneumatically-operated apparatus having a variable inlet air flow demand , the compressor having adjustable_inlet_guide_vanes , said method comprising the steps of : ( a ) interconnecting a supply_duct between the compressor and the pneumatically-operated apparatus ; ( b ) flowing discharge air from the compressor through said supply_duct to the pneumatically-operated apparatus ; ( c ) maintaining an essentially constant minimum supply_duct flow_rate , despite fluctuations in the flow_rate of air received by the pneumatically-operated apparatus , by exhausting air from said supply_duct in response to variations therein of the value of a predetermined , flow-related parameter , the flow_rate of air exhausted from said supply_duct being related to the magnitude of said parameter value variations in both a proportional and time-integral manner , said maintaining step including the steps of providing an outlet_passage from said supply_duct , positioning in said outlet_passage a surge_bleed_valve operable to selectively vary the flow of air outwardly through said outlet_passage , generating an integral control_signal in response to said variation in said flow-related parameter , generating a proportional control_signal in response to said variations in said flow-related parameter , and simultaneously utilizing said integral and proportional_control_signals to operate said surge_bleed_valve ; and ( d ) adjusting the relationship between the magnitudes of said integral and proportional_control_signals and the magnitudes of said parameter variations as a function of the position of the inlet_guide_vanes .

A gas_turbine_engine accessory power unit having a fluctuating compressed air_supply_demand , said accessory power unit comprising : ( a ) a compressor having adjustable_inlet_guide_vanes ; ( b ) duct_means for receiving compressed air discharged from said compressor and supplying the received air to the pneumatically-powered apparatus ; ( c ) surge_bleed means operable to exhaust from said duct_means a selectively variable quantity of air to assure at least a predetermined minimum_flow_rate through said duct_means and thereby prevent surge of said compressor ; ( d ) sensing means for sensing the value of a predetermined , flow-related parameter within said duct_means and generating an output_signal indicative of said value , said value of said flow-related parameter being substantially independent of the temperature of the compressed air ; ( e ) comparator means for receiving said sensing means output_signal and generating an error_signal representing the difference between the sensed value of said parameter and a desired value thereof , said comparator means having an adjustable control set_point representing said desired value of said parameter ; ( f ) means for transmitting to said comparator means a reset signal for varying said set_point as a function of the position of said inlet_guide_vanes in accordance with a predetermined reset schedule ; and ( g ) control means for receiving said error_signal and transmitting to said surge_bleed means a control_signal to operate said surge_bleed means , the magnitude of said control_signal having , relative to the magnitude of said error_signal , a proportional component and an integral component , whereby said minimum_flow_rate through said duct_means is essentially constant regardless of the compressed air_supply_demand of the pneumatically-powered apparatus .
