A method of chemically bonding elastomeric materials to chemically inert polyolefins , the method comprising : [ a ] exposing a chemically inert polyolefin_surface to a corona_discharge treatment , [ b ] applying to the corona_discharge treated surface of the polyolefin a primer_solution of ethyl silicate , ethyl orthosilicate and tetra butyl titanate in an organic solvent , [ c ] placing the treated and primed surface of polyolefin in contact with the surface of an uncured elastomeric_compound of molecular weight above 61,000 with a minimum elongation modulus of fifty percent ; and , [ d ] applying heat to the composite material to cure the elastomeric_compound while pressing the polyolefin elastomeric_compound article firmly together , whereby upon curing of the elastomeric material the polyolefin will be firmly and securely bonded thereto .
