top sentences:

A method of assembling and overhauling a disk brake having a plurality of disks with available_wear_portions of predetermined different thicknesses comprising positioning a first_group of said disks in overlapping relationship with a second_group of said disks , said first_group of said disks having each of said available_wear_portions of a first_thickness , said second_group of said disks having each of said available_wear_portions of a second_thickness , said first_thickness of each of said available_wear_portions of said first_group of said disks being less than said second_thickness of each of said available_wear_portions of said second_group of said disks , replacing said first_group of said disks with a third_group of said disks at an intermediate_brake_overhaul_time when said available_wear_portions of said first_group are substantially fully worn , said available_wear_portions of each of said third_group of said disks having a third thickness greater than the thickness of each of said available_wear_portions of said second_group of said disks at said intermediate_brake_overhaul_time .

A disk_brake_assembly comprising a first_group of brake_disks and a second_group of brake_disks in axially aligned and interleaved relationship , said disks of said first_group being interleaved with said disks of said second_group in alternating relationship , each of said disks of said first_group and said second_group having oppositely disposed wear surfaces , said wear surfaces on opposite_sides of each brake_disk of said first_group are equal in thickness , said wear surfaces on opposite_sides of each brake_disk of said second_group are equal in thickness , said wear surfaces of said first_group of said disks having a first_thickness , said wear surfaces of said second_group of said disks having a second_thickness , said first_thickness of said first_group of said disks being less than said *1581 second_thickness of said second_group of said disks whereby after a predetermined_number of brake_applications the available_wear_thickness of said first_group of said disks are substantially fully worn away at an intermediate_overhaul_time and said available_wear_thickness of said second_group of said disks are not worn away .
