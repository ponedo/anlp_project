Claim 1 of the BIG_TOKEN__¡¬618_patent__BIG_TOKEN recites : A heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides , such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight_average_molecular_weight less than that of heparin and said admixture consisting essentially of from 9 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight less than 2,000 daltons from 5 % to 20 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight greater than 8,000 daltons , and from 60-86 % of polysaccharide_chains having a molecular_weight of between 2 , BIG_TOKEN__000_and_8__BIG_TOKEN ,000 daltons , the ratio between the weight_average_molecular_weight and the number average molecular_weight thereof ranging from 1.BIG_TOKEN__3_to_1__BIG_TOKEN .6 said admixture ( i ) exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic activity greater than heparin and ( ii ) having an average molecular_weight of between approximately 3 , BIG_TOKEN__500_and_5__BIG_TOKEN ,500 daltons .
