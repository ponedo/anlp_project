A method for reflow_soldering of surface mounted devices to a printed circuit_board comprising : moving a printed circuit_board having solder and devices disposed on a surface thereof through a first zone and in close_proximity to a first emitting surface of at least one nonfocused infrared_panel_emitter , said first emitting surface being at a first_panel_temperature ; moving said board through a second zone and in close_proximity to a second emitting surface of at least one nonfocused infrared_panel_emitter , said second emitting surface being at a second_panel_temperature lower than said first_panel_temperature ; and moving said board through a third zone and in close_proximity to a third emitting surface of at least one nonfocused infrared_panel_emitter , said third emitting surface being at a third panel temperature higher than said second_panel_temperature , said third emitting surface heating said board and said solder to a solder_reflow_temperature for a period of time sufficient to cause said solder to reflow and solder said devices to said board while maintaining the temperature of said devices below said solder_reflow_temperature .
9.629332
The boards remain in the last heating zone for only a short duration , allowing the solder to reach a temperature high enough to cause the solder to melt and reflow while maintaining the devices themselves below the solder_reflow_temperature .
7.281333
In the final and hottest zone , the solder paste melts and forms a connection between the device and the circuit_board .
7.194042
In this process , a solder paste is placed on the circuit_board and the devices to be soldered ( with attached connectors ) are placed on the paste .
6.164927
Due to this temperature differential , the solder flows up the device connectors to form a solid connection .
