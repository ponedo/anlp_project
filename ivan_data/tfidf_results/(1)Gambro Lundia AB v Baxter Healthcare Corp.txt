Claim 1 of the '552 patent reads : [ 1 ] In dialysis equipment including a dialyser , a system for measuring the difference in the rate of flow between first and second_fluid_streams , said first_fluid_stream comprising clean dialysis solution flowing to the dialyser and said second_fluid_stream comprising spent dialysis solution flowing from the dialyser , said system comprising [ 2 ] a first duct for receiving said first_fluid_stream flowing therethrough , [ 3 ] a second_duct for receiving said second_fluid_stream flowing therethrough , [ 4 ] measuring means for measuring the difference in the rate of flow between said *1576 first and second_fluid_streams within said first and second_ducts , [ 5 ] and transferring means for preventing the flow of said second_fluid_stream through said second_duct while flowing said first_fluid_stream through both said first and second_ducts without passing said first_fluid_stream through the dialyser and without altering said rate of flow of said first_fluid_stream between said first and second_ducts such that said rate of flow of said first_fluid_stream through said first and second_ducts is substantially equal , [ 6 ] whereby the measured difference of the rate of flow of said first_fluid_stream flowing through said first and second_ducts is adaptable as a reference .
