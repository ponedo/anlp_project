A MOS_transistor typically consists of a gate_electrode that has been deposited on a thin dielectric ( insulating ) layer over the substrate , with electrically conductive `` source '' and `` drain '' regions formed in the substrate on opposing sides of the gate_electrode .
7.609385
The portion of the substrate under the gate_electrode is shielded from the vertical ion implantation , whereby after implantation the edges of the source and drain regions are generally vertically aligned with the sides of the gate_electrode .
7.311267
In accordance with the '943 method , dielectric oxide layers are thermally grown on the top and sides of the gate_electrode .
5.652534
After implantation , the entire structure is heated to activate the ions in the implanted regions , as is necessary to make the regions conductive .
