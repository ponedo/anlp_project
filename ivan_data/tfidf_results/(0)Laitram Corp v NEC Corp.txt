A method of electro-optically printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on the recording surface of a photosensitive_material , said method comprising the steps of : arranging a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters in a straight_line *1345 array , each of the said emitters being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said photosensitive_material is sensitive , selectively energizing for predetermined_periods of time each of the said emitters , transmitting the emitted radiation from each of the said emitters to a different_area on said surface , providing relative_movement along a single coordinate substantially perpendicular to said array at substantially constant_speed between said recording surface and said emitters , and coordinating the predetermined_periods of time in which each of said plurality of emitters [ are ] is selectively energized with said constant_speed of said relative_movement between said emitters and recording surface so that alpha-numeric_character_images are recorded on said recording surface by exposure of selected [ ares ] area of said recording surface by said emitted radiation , said step of coordinating including the steps of synchronously generating a first data signal which programs the order [ to ] of energization of said emitters and a second data signal which determines the duration of the energization period of said emitters , and employing said first and second data signals to effect energization of said emitters so as to record said alpha-numeric_character_images of said type_quality at said high_speed .

An electro-optical printing apparatus for printing type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters at high_speed on a surface of photosensitive recording_material , said apparatus comprising : a plurality of rapidly reacting radiation_emitters each being capable of emitting radiation at wavelengths to which said surface is sensitive , said emitters being disposed in an array along a substantially straight_line , said array being a plurality of rows of said radiation_emitters ; means for moving said recording_material in a single direction substantially perpendicular to said straight_line with its surface adjacent to said array , and at a substantially constant_speed relative to said array and ; means for selectively activating each of said emitters for predetermined_periods of time , and means for coordinating the predetermined period of time in which each of the said plurality of emitters are activated with said constant relative speed of said recording_material so that the radiation emitted by said emitters will be recorded on selected areas of said recording surface in the form of an alipha [ sic ] -numeric image , each of said emitters being positioned to irradiate a different_area of said recording surface , the different_areas of said surface irradiated by each of the said emitters being arranged in an overlapping relationship with one another and said plurality of emitters being of sufficient number to print said type_quality_alpha-numeric_characters .
