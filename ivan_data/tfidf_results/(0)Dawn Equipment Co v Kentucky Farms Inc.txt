Claim 9 of the patent , the only claim at issue , provides ( emphasis added ) : *1012 A mechanism for adjusting the height of a farm_implement/tool of the type to be carried by a drawing_vehicle , said adjusting mechanism comprising : a connecting_means for supporting a farm_implement/tool in an operative position ; means for guiding sliding movement of the connecting_means selectively between first and second_positions corresponding to raised and lowered positions for a farm_implement/tool carried by the connecting_means ; means for mounting the guiding means to one of a drawing_vehicle and a support to be carried by a drawing_vehicle ; means for locking the connecting_means in one of the first and second_positions and for selectively releasing the connecting_means to allow the connecting_means to be slid into the other of the first and second_positions_therefor ; means for limiting sliding movement of the connecting_means with the connecting_means released ; and means for normally spring biasing the connecting_means to one of the first and second_positions_therefor .
