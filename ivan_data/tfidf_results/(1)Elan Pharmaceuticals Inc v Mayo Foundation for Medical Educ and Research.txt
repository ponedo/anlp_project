A transgenic_rodent comprising a diploid genome comprising a transgene encoding a heterologous_APP_polypeptide having the Swedish_mutation wherein the amino_acid residues at positions corresponding to positions_BIG_TOKEN__595_and_596__BIG_TOKEN in human_APP695 are asparagine and leucine , respectively , wherein the transgene is expressed to produce a human_APP_polypeptide having the Swedish_mutation , and wherein said polypeptide is processed to ATF-betaAPP in a sufficient_amount to be detectable in a brain_homogenate of said transgenic_rodent .

A transgenic_rodent comprising *1054 a diploid genome comprising a transgene comprising in operable linkage a promoter , a DNA segment encoding a heterologous_APP_polypeptide and a polyadenlyation site , wherein the APP polypeptide has the Swedish_mutation whereby the amino_acid residues at positions corresponding to positions_BIG_TOKEN__595_and_596__BIG_TOKEN in human_APP695 are asparagine and leucine , respectively , wherein the transgene is expressed to produce a human_APP_polypeptide having the Swedish_mutation , and wherein said polypeptide is processed to ATF-betaAPP in a sufficient_amount to be detectable in a brain_homogenate of said transgenic_rodent .
6.513919
Humans who do not develop Alzheimer 's disease are believed to break down the APP in a manner that does not form significant amounts of betaAP in the brain .
5.934088
It is believed that a mechanism by which betaAP is formed is the abnormal_cleavage of a protein produced in brain cells , called the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) ; and that this abnormal_cleavage occurs when an enzyme produced in the brain , called beta-secretase , cleaves the APP molecule between amino_acids BIG_TOKEN__596_and_597__BIG_TOKEN ; and a second enzyme produced in the brain , called gamma-secretase , releases the betaAP fragment from a portion of the cleaved APP .
