====================================
top sentences:

The claims in the originally-filed application1 explicitly recited a pressure_jacket in front of the syringe receiving opening .
25.198327
The court observed that a pressure_jacket was necessary to `` maintain the integrity of the syringe housing against pressures the syringe encounters during operation of the injector . ''
24.792001
For example , the BIG_TOKEN__¡¬858_patent__BIG_TOKEN describes that the bar_code on the syringe can include information relating to the `` dimensions '' of the syringe , whereas the asserted claims recite the `` capacity '' of the syringe .
22.511056
In addition , the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents recite physical_indicia related to properties of the syringe other than the `` capacity of said syringe '' as recited in representative_claim 7 of the BIG_TOKEN__¡¬612_patent__BIG_TOKEN .
19.669881
Claim 7 of the BIG_TOKEN__¡¬612_patent__BIG_TOKEN is representative of the asserted claims of the syringe-sensing patents and reads as follows : An injector of the type having a motor which advances and retracts a plunger located within a syringe toward and away from a nozzle located at a distal end of the syringe to inject fluid into or out of an animal subject , adapted for use with syringe assemblies which have differing capacities , comprising : a detector located proximate to a syringe installed on said injector for detecting a physical_indicia [ sic ] on said syringe related to the capacity of said syringe , and generating an electrical signal representative of said physical_indicia , and a control_circuit which causes said motor to move and tracks the location of said motor while moving said motor , wherein said control_circuit *1376 computes the location of a plunger within said syringe relative to an end of said syringe , by relating said electrical signal to the tracked location of said motor .
