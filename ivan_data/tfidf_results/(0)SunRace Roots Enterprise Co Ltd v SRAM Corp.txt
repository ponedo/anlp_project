top sentences:

They include providing a derailleur shifting system with a shift_actuator that is rotatably mounted on the handlebar so that the bicycle_rider need not remove his hands from the handlebar to shift gears ; *1300 providing a derailleur shifting system having a handgrip shift_actuator embodying a generally helical cam that defines the derailleur mechanism movements ; providing a derailleur shifting system that compensates for `` cumulative lost motion '' ( the amount the shifter must move in order to take up any slack in the system before the derailleur begins to move ) in the derailleur mechanism and its cable to enable precise index shifting ; and providing a derailleur shifting system that produces an optimum amount of overshift when down-shifting , without requiring manual input to define that overshift .
