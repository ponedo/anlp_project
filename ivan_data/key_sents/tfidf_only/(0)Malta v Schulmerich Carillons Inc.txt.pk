	However, the clapper could not be adjusted while the bell was being played.	7.763961566093204
	These bells are simple devices.	7.419463328351918
	Attached to one end of the clapper assembly is a generally circular clapper or striker which, when the handbell is swung, strikes the bell to ring it.	5.891981494824408
	The patent drawing shows the Malta bell:	5.571228488267032
	The jury was shown bell clappers two hundred years old having this feature.	5.174876592045358
	He explained to the jury that it was not new to use striking surfaces of different hardness on the bell clapper, in order to change the bell tone.	5.042864555189541
	Most relevant to this suit is Malta's provision of a clapper mechanism for allowing the loudness of the bell to be quickly adjusted "on the fly," i.e., while the bell is being played.	5.026631034587624
	Another form of clapper is depicted in Fig.	4.942510461001426
	Handbells are generally made up of the bell itself, a handle attached to the closed end of the bell, and a clapper assembly pivotably mounted inside the bell and moving in a single plane.	4.840780351605725
	The rotation of the clapper to change the striking surface, thereby changing the bell tone, was well known.	4.600014001421922
	I'll ring it now. (Rings a bell.)	4.4832277254780895
	actual bells were shown and handed to jury	4.457606631174313
	In that way, the clapper could be rotated by hand while the handbell was being played.	4.454537007524696
	this element was known in prior art bells	4.449791958605372
	The novel contribution of the Malta bell to the art was the mechanism for rapid adjustment of the clapper during performance; that aspect is not here challenged.	4.250727213406955
	Looking first at the invention as a whole, there was substantial evidence that the accused bell functioned by instantaneous hand adjustment of the clapper, as does the claimed bell; changing the striking surfaces of varying hardness, thereby changing the tone of the bell.	4.163347980869234
	Specifically, it was known in the prior art to provide the peripheral surface of the clapper with portions of differing hardness so that, by rotating the clapper, one could change which portion of it struck the bell and consequently the loudness of the bell.	4.130027096856039
	Right now this clapper is aligned so that there are felt surfaces in the striking plane.	4.08358663790349
	The '082 patent discloses two different embodiments for the clapper.	4.044328908295036
	A 1902 catalogue of prior art bells, about which Malta also testified, shows "pins" of different materials on a rotatable clapper.	3.91988530697019

	I'll run through it now quickly. (Rings a bell.)	3.733541852824059
	The simplicity of the bells, so emphasized by the dissent, is not relevant either.	3.7270892357201864
	Schulmerich did not dispute that the accused bells use the embodiment of Figure 3.	3.7089058648583375
	3 of the '082 patent and those of the Quick-Adjust handbells.	3.6805890447496727
	5. equivalency of the striking surfaces was explained and demonstrated using accused bell	3.3851919359191114
	As to way, there was substantial evidence of how the tone is changed on rotation of the clapper, due to the change in hardness of the surface in the striking plane, for the claimed and the accused bells.	3.2507777534246514
	6. this element was known in prior art bells a clapper assembly adapted to be removably carried within said bell and centrally of the closed end thereof, 1. photograph of disassembled parts of bell with transparent overlay of claim text for this element 2. a second color drawing highlighting this element in accused bell 3. explained by witness 4. no contradictory evidence 5.	3.2287096833958553
	To be sure, the jury was told and shown that the "function" and "result" of their clappers striking the bells were the same, and indeed these two aspects of equivalency are all but uncontested.	3.1982352904580114
	this element was known in prior art bells said clapper member comprising a generally circular striker assembly rotatably positioned substantially normal to said clapper shaft 1. photograph of disassembled parts of bell with transparent overlay of claim text for this element 2. a fourth color drawing highlighting this element in accused bell 3. explained by witness 4. no contradictory evidence 5.	3.1637936060239342
	The third pair (70) has a piece of soft material such as felt attached to the clapper.	3.156429354700795
	The '082 patent not only provided the clapper with striking surfaces of differing hardness around the periphery thereof, but also provided a detent mechanism which releasably locked the clapper in each desired position.	3.1130350883313973
	The first pair (66) consists simply of the hard rubber of which the clapper is made.	3.1045073575545112
	As to result, there was substantial evidence of the rapidly adjustable changes in tone of the accused bell, as in the claimed bell, to obtain soft, medium, and hard tones.	3.065940180505546

[Emphasis ours.]	2.8962533457840176
	Following is another example of the testimony in which Malta explained and demonstrated the "way" the bells work, by rotating the clapper and aligning the surfaces of varying degrees of hardness in the striking plane.	2.886064465447461
	The jury was shown 24ï¿½ï¿½ x 30ï¿½ï¿½ photographs of the details of disassembled bells, and Mr. Malta used transparent overlays identifying each part of the accused bells and the corresponding element in each claim.	2.884231832393818

	color drawing highlighting this element in accused bell 3. explained by witness	2.8346092116676127
	Malta presented substantial evidence that the function of the opposed pairs of felt/plastic striking surfaces in the Schulmerich bells, and of the opposed pairs of striking buttons of the claim, is to produce varying tones on striking the bell.	2.794331046129282
	Claim 3, the only claim at issue, is directed to the entire bell, as discussed infra.	2.786547025759738
	He identified each of the elements of the claims, and the corresponding element of the accused bells.	2.7853562799306655
	To my mind, it is clearly no answer to point, as does the dissent, to the great quantity of evidence on the general operation of each of the two bells at issue in this case, i.e., the commercial embodiment of the claimed bell and the accused bell.	2.78452792332396
	Malta explained all this at trial, with explicit reference to the claimed invention and the accused bells.	2.7831982572232445
	In this embodiment, the clapper will offer three opposed areas of strike, each with a different impact effect and available according to its position relative to the plane of swing of the clapper 26.	2.747210655029503
	Opposed pairs of buttons 82 are of the same hardness and each opposed pair is of a different hardness to accomplish the same results as described in connection with the clapper shown in FIG.	2.680483389887168
	The second embodiment, shown in Fig. 7, has three "opposed pairs of buttons" (82) attached to the surface of the clapper.	2.6146284658364007
	Would you make that clear as to what the structure is in the Schulmerich bell that corresponds to the buttons that are recited in the claim?	2.611977916873734

	a fifth color drawing highlighting this element in accused bell 3. explained by witness	2.5243344954100277
	The patent specification discusses their relationship, and explains that the varying hardness of these surfaces varies the tone of the bell.	2.513893862630337
	no contradictory evidence [this was the other new element; its presence in the accused bells was admitted]	2.505689350198281
	6. both forms of striking surfaces were illustrated as alternatives in the patent in suit 7. both forms of striking surfaces were known in the prior art means on said clapper assembly coacting with said rotatable striker assembly for permitting rotation of said striker assembly relative to said clapper shaft for selectively positioning desired pairs of buttons in striking relation to said bell; 1. photograph of disassembled parts of bell with transparent overlay of claim text for this element 2.	2.4875069321413825
	That clapper surfaces with slots were known as an alternative to buttons of differing materials does not necessarily make them an equivalent.	2.4357528894070715
	Malta here, and elsewhere, did compare each pair of striking surfaces, and did explain to the jury the way the various striking surfaces changed the tone of the bell.	2.43561818087915
	Music for handbells was now written that could not have been performed before.	2.4316161152730493
	Quoting the patent, "a chorus of players using a plurality of tuned bells may render any given tune which falls within the range of notes offered by the specific bells".	2.41658258080409
	no dispute as to presence of opposed pairs of striking elements positioned around the outer periphery of the clapper, each pair having a different degree of hardness [the only dispute at trial was the equivalency of the striking buttons of the claim clause and the felt/plastic striking surfaces of the accused bells]	2.379890612891441
	The patent specification describes how the hardness of the "strike portions" is varied, and how these alternative embodiments function to change the tone of the bell.	2.361388646860144
	no contradictory evidence [this was the first new element of the claimed bell; its presence in the accused bells was admitted] and detent means cooperating with said rotatable striker for releasably holding said striker assembly in any preselected position.	2.283531972136855
	From these photographs and drawings, Mr. Malta compared each claim element with the corresponding element in the accused bells.	2.252434372779148
	Malta also explained that it was not new to use clappers having the striking surfaces illustrated in the patent; that these striking surfaces were known.	2.2275933102336736
	Mr. Malta demonstrated how the clapper is rotated during performance and click-locked into the desired striking position: the new elements of the claimed combination.	2.2099882966346254
	Because of the rapid adjustability of the bells that Malta invented, performers have achieved musical effects not previously available in the old, indeed ancient, art of handbell music.	2.158996167600137
	It was explained to the jury that what was new in Malta's bells was his means for rapidly changing the striking surfaces during a musical performance.	2.127960129276736
	this element was known in prior art bells and including a plurality of striking buttons positioned in opposed pairs around the outer periphery thereof and wherein each pair of buttons has a different degree of hardness; 1. photograph of disassembled parts of bell with transparent overlay of claim text for this element 2.	2.126725652134503

	The jury viewed a videotaped musical performance during which Malta stopped the tape to show the patented bells being quickly adjusted by the performers.	1.929319355129151
	Malta also presented substantial evidence that the way the striking surfaces produce varying tones is by their varying degrees of hardness, in the accused bells and in the claimed invention.	1.8999397041219312
	The two companies currently supply about 95% of the handbell market.	1.8802347439925258
	The clapper is restricted in its motion so that it will only move through one plane, and it's going to be moving toward you.	1.8780649224823678
	The '082 patent discloses a number of improvements in handbell design.	1.8764880272141513
	Schulmerich argued that the '082 patent uses the word "buttons" only in conjunction with the embodiment of Fig. 7, and that the Quick-Adjust handbells do not have such buttons.	1.8664009596174316
	Using physical and documentary evidence, Malta testified that the felt, solid plastic, and slotted plastic surfaces of the accused bells "function like buttons".	1.8503662338333697
	a seventh color drawing highlighting this element in accused bell 3. explained and demonstrated by witness 4. demonstrated in videotaped performance 5.	1.8096049663988003
	The issue on this appeal is the jury verdict of equivalency, a verdict that required the jury to consider certain known, interchangeable clapper structures.	1.807184440530283
	a sixth color drawing highlighting this element in accused bell 3. explained and demonstrated by witness 4. demonstrated in videotaped performance 5.	1.8066787612784134
	For example, the patent specification shows the felt and plastic striking surfaces that are used in the accused bells, and also shows the button striking surfaces of claim 3.	1.770900088550709
	As the dissent details, in the instant case extensive evidence was presented about how the striking surfaces of the accused bell work.	1.7619101388337413
	The structure is these portions of the clapper, in this case the opposed felt pieces, and adjacent thereto on each side these elliptical spots of green, indicating that there are additional pairs of opposed striking surfaces.	1.6919769267492932
	The structure is these portions of the clapper, in this case the opposed felt pieces, and adjacent thereto on each side these elliptical spots of green, indicating that there are additional pairs of opposed striking surfaces.	1.6919769267492932
	I emphasize that the striking surfaces used in the Schulmerich bells, the only claim element for which equivalence was at issue, were described, as well as pictured, in the patent.3	1.6517596237783139
	Malmark quickly grew and became the primary competitor of Schulmerich in the handbell business.	1.6216301458830196
	No amount of purely descriptive evidence about either can suffice, absent separate, explicit and substantial comparison evidence that the clapper "striking surfaces" work in the same "way" as the "buttons".	1.5890358390259522
	Here, no separate and explicit comparison evidence at all was presented as to whether, how and why the clapper surfaces of the same plastic material with slots drilled behind them operated in the same "way" as the striking buttons made of materials of different hardness.	1.5775502666353527
	The claims of the patent maintain this distinction; claim 2 describes the surface of the clapper using the broad term "surface portions," while claim 3 uses the narrower term "buttons".	1.5553370630305772
	In addition to the well-organized testimony, there were the actual bells, the photographs, the charts, the videotape, the description and drawings in the patent, and the prior art.	1.5538640528280971
	This explains why the jury did not find infringement of claim 2, for that claim requires the presence of an additional element (the indexing means) that was not found present in the Schulmerich bells.	1.5256854928402122
	It was not disputed by Schulmerich that these new elements, as well as all the other elements of claim 3 except the form of the striking surfaces, were literally present in the accused bells.	1.5244377739253994
	Each pair of buttons has a different degree of hardness so that, like the embodiment of Fig. 3, either a soft, medium, or loud sound can be produced, depending on which button pair is aligned to strike the bell. (The patent's term "opposed pairs" is somewhat confusing. The pairs are not opposed; rather, each pair has opposed buttons of the same hardness.)	1.4767937234929374
	Malta also explained this correspondence between the striking surfaces of the claimed and the accused bells using a color-highlighted drawing labelled with the relevant claim clause.	1.461897186212558
	And in so doing the tone that results will be brighter because we do not have felt covering the surface, felt being softer, but it will not be as bright as it will in the next position which we'll use opposed surfaces where there are no cord slots. (Rings a bell.)	1.4372950376645237
	The jury was not separately and explicitly told, however, that drilling slots behind striking surfaces on a clapper made of the same plastic material is an equivalent "way" compared to attaching striking buttons made from different materials.	1.3377442621328526
	Lear Siegler, 873 F.2d at 1425, 10 USPQ2d at 1770, Nestier, 739 F.2d at 1579-80, 222 USPQ at 750.	1.3126988781054798
	1097, 85 USPQ 828 (1950) and explicitly by Lear Siegler, Inc. v.	1.3113091036335804
	He pointed to the accused striking surfaces, using a color-highlighted drawing, and testified that "these are the three positions that I described earlier on the clapper that produce the hard, medium and soft", and that "each pair has a different degree of hardness".	1.2901947805522636
	He testified that the felt striking surfaces in the Schulmerich handbells (shown in Fig. 3 of the patent) function in the same way and with the same effect as the softest pair of buttons (Fig. 7) to produce a soft tone.	1.2761804816950715
	With respect to claim 3, Schulmerich denied infringement primarily on the ground that its Quick-Adjust handbells do not have a striker assembly with "a plurality of striking buttons positioned in opposed pairs around the outer periphery thereof and wherein each pair of buttons has a different degree of hardness".	1.270814646289295
	All of this evidence was specific to the issue of equivalency of the striking buttons and the felt/plastic/slotted plastic surfaces.	1.1911869452035722
	Nor is it relevant that, as the dissent notes, slots in the clapper material were well known in the prior art, for the obviousness of the "way" cannot explicate for judge or jury that it is equivalent, i.e., substantially the same, much less how and why.	1.1741938442472695
	Rather, it was the observed fact of the similar properties when used in the claimed composition that was legally significant.5 Malta also provided substantial evidence that the resulting change of tones is the same, for the striking surfaces of the accused bells and those of claim 3.	1.159268411392133
	He also testified with the aid of seven 24ï¿½ï¿½ x 30ï¿½ï¿½ drawings for each claim, each drawing highlighting in color a different part of the accused bells, and labelled to show the corresponding element of the claims.	1.141190093787277
	It is apparent that other deviations may also be used without departing from the spirit of my invention which comprehends a manually adjustable clapper having a plurality of strike portions, in opposed relation and of different hardness, to selectively produce a variety of tonal effects.	1.1391160485986112
	Holder of patent for handbells brought action against competitor alleging infringement under doctrine of equivalents.	1.1284273652067565
	He testified that the plastic striking surfaces (Fig. 3) and the plastic surfaces with slots (Fig. 3) of the Schulmerich handbells function in the same way and with the same effect as the harder and medium pairs of buttons (Fig. 7), to produce the brilliant and medium tones.	1.1182872785470004
	The opposed locations or surfaces which are related to these long slots are likewise buttons and the opposed pair of solid portions again are buttons.	1.069240810693329
	However, the rule of Lear Siegler is a prophylactic rule of general applicability.	1.0183944991695397
	The district court's detailed opinion of November 21, 1989, discussed the doctrine of equivalents and its proper application at great length and came to the correct conclusion that "Plaintiffs offered no more than brief, conclusory evidence that the Schulmerich bell contains the equivalent of the disputed buttons".	0.9976970837936228
	Not until Lear Siegler did a panel of this court impose the special rules now relied on.	0.9953102099365241
	As was noted earlier, compliance with Lear Siegler is a legal question.	0.9841178384232673
	In 1985, Malta sued Schulmerich (and other defendants), alleging, among other things, that a line of Schulmerich handbells sold under the trademark "Quick-Adjust" infringes claims 2 and 3 of the	0.9825772013314654
	And Claim 3 includes as a part of the striker assembly the phrase, "A plurality of striking buttons positioned in opposed pairs around the outer periphery thereof wherein each pair of buttons is a different degree of hardness," correct?	0.9618762651450269
	As further evidence of the equivalence of the striking surfaces, it was explained to the jury that the prior art '574 patent describes the same felt, plastic, and slotted plastic surfaces as were shown to be present in the accused bells, as were shown to be pictured in Figure 3 of the patent in suit, and as were discussed by Malta in his testimony.	0.959694474272857
	The jury was given special interrogatories asking whether the Quick-Adjust handbells infringed claims 2 and 3 of the '082 patent, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.	0.926257432161262
	Do you mean they're buttons or function like buttons?	0.9148839562507152
	They function like buttons....	0.9040178018185309
	There was substantial evidence of the function, way, and result of the striking surfaces of the accused handbells compared with the striking surfaces of the claimed invention.	0.8918747927927438
	Claim 2 is very similar to claim 3 and differs primarily in two respects: one, instead of the "coacting" means recited in claim 3, claim 2 requires an "indexing means" on the handle and the clapper assembly; and, two, instead of the "buttons" recited in claim 3, claim 2 requires "at least three opposed pairs of surface portions wherein each of said pairs has a different degree of hardness".	0.8795248481854523
	Compliance with Lear Siegler is a question of law, which we review de novo.	0.8743234599288254

	In requiring sufficient evidence on each aspect of equivalence, Lear Siegler merely makes explicit what Graver Tank implied.	0.6884525516917147
	The jury was instructed that in order to find infringement every element of the claim or the equivalent of every element must be present in the accused device.4 Looking at the specific claim element for which equivalency was at issue, i.e., the "plurality of striking buttons in opposed pairs having different degrees of hardness", again there was testimonial, documentary, and real evidence of the function, way, and result that characterize this element in the accused bells, and equivalency to the function, way, and result that characterize the corresponding element of the claim.	0.6845968532612283
	Infringement under the Doctrine of Equivalents may exist if the accused handbells perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way so as to obtain substantially the same results as the claimed invention.	0.6770240219990075
	Infringement under the Doctrine of Equivalents may exist if the accused handbells perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way so as to obtain substantially the same results as the claimed invention.	0.6762533187948183
	The panel majority states that Lear Siegler merely repeats an earlier ruling in Nestier Corp. v. Menasha Corp.-Lewisystems Div., 739 F.2d 1576,	0.6725761500405075
	In Lear Siegler, the devices at issue-mattress springs-were equally simple and in no manner implicated complex technology.	0.6401045905355438
	The specification also discusses the striking buttons of Figure 7, and relates them to the Figure 3 embodiment and to the invention as a whole:	0.6376703272198426
	Mr. Malta's offhand and conclusory statements ("buttons or the equivalent thereof" and "They function like buttons") are not sufficiently particularized evidence.	0.6315368083191623
	Do you find those buttons in [the accused] structure?	0.6174622528701018
	In Lear Siegler, this court reversed a jury's finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, stating, among other things:	0.6087862569571161
	The majority instead imposes the new requirements of "particularized testimony and linking argument" that were set forth in Lear Siegler, Inc. v.	0.6071349336833092
	Further, the patent specifically uses the term "striking surfaces" with respect to the embodiment of Fig. 3, but uses the different term "buttons" with respect to Fig. 7.	0.5717495827440887
	The dissent also suggests that Schulmerich's failure to request jury instructions on the rule of Lear Siegler means Schulmerich waived the protections of the rule.	0.570913580771218
	The New Rules for Jury Trials Eight months after this jury verdict was rendered this court held, in Lear Siegler, Inc. v.	0.5695522950350174
	These requirements, which apply solely to jury trials, were not referred to at the trial, for Lear Siegler was decided eight months after this jury verdict was rendered.2	0.5607517956259269
	I quoted ante Malta's discussion of how slots in the plastic surface affect the tone:	0.549077309029561
	The first embodiment, shown in Fig. 3, has three opposing pairs of "striking surfaces".	0.5445284314577472
	The-as I described, we have a plurality of buttons, there's three sets, buttons or the equivalent thereof, and they are in opposed pairs around the periphery.	0.5357971239957114
	The-as I described, we have a plurality of buttons, there's three sets, buttons or the equivalent thereof, and they are in opposed pairs around the periphery.	0.5357971239957114
	The judge, relying heavily on the Lear Siegler decision, found that Malta had not provided "particularized testimony and linking argument" as to each of the function/way/result prongs of the tripartite Graver Tank equivalency test and granted JNOV in favor of Schulmerich.	0.5347257398057577
	Contrary to the dissent, the rule of Lear Siegler does not implicate the jury's prerogatives, under the Constitution, the case law, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or otherwise.	0.526696706713482
	Mr. Malta explained and demonstrated to the jury that the use of striking surfaces made from material of varying degrees of hardness was known in the prior art; and that the use both of striking buttons and striking surfaces made of felt, plastic, and plastic with slots, to produce varying degrees of hardness, was known in the prior art.	0.5252863184361117
	THE LAW APPLIED TO THIS CASE	0.5207793668647035
	In particular, the judge instructed the jury that Infringement under the doctrine of equivalents may exist if the accused handbells perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way so as to obtain substantially the same results as the claimed invention.	0.5169082306715201
	This court in Lear Siegler, following Nestier, held that a patentee must prove substantial identity as to each of the function, way, and result prongs of the doctrine of equivalents.	0.5049896600637449
	Reading the opinion is enough to show that the district court was right in saying (n. 7): "Lear Siegler merely repeats in so many words the explication of Nestier".	0.5008431060714843
	In Lear Siegler, we said the party asserting infringement must present "evidence and argument concerning the doctrine and each of its elements".	0.4957230854862448
	Malta demonstrated to the jury how the different striking surfaces produced different tones.	0.4909244505623306
	In response, Malta argued, and presented evidence to show, that the word "buttons" was not limited to the embodiment of Fig. 7, but should be construed broadly to literally include striking surfaces such as those of Fig.	0.47704713778720886
	And in so doing the tone that results will be brighter because we do not have felt covering the surface, felt being softer, but it will not be as bright as it will in the next position which we'll use opposed surfaces where there are no cord slots.	0.4644123697992278
	The panel majority, applying Lear Siegler to remove this case from the jury, has invoked a new requirement of proof of equivalency: proof of not only the three Graver Tank "prongs" of "function, way, and result", but also a fourth prong of "why".	0.44933177781695827
	As the district court noted, the danger that Lear Siegler, building directly on Nestier Corp., is designed to prevent is that of the doctrine of equivalents becoming "a result oriented catch-all".	0.4461257447705472
	I turn it to the next indexing spot and this spot are the opposed surfaces contain cord in, molded in slots.	0.4442197559341219
	Lear Siegler, 873 F.2d at 1426-27, 10 USPQ2d at 1770-71.5  With this requirement in mind, we agree with the district court that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.	0.4390314627382245
	Thus, under Nestier Corp. and Lear Siegler, substantial evidence of comparison as to function, way, and result is required as part of the patentee's prima facie case of infringement under the doctrine.	0.43845234464386923
	If, as both members of the panel majority insist, the Lear Siegler requirements are not new, their unprotested absence from the jury instructions, and from every other aspect of the trial, means that they were waived.	0.4273476766210316
	Here, this would be in relation to this slotted portion here where we have a slot in the core and at 180 degrees another slot, that would be the medium impact position.	0.42335256943707955
	Here, this would be in relation to this slotted portion here where we have a slot in the core and at 180 degrees another slot, that would be the medium impact position.	0.42335256943707955
	Because Lear Siegler clearly requires separate, explicit and substantial comparison evidence as to all three requirements, the case should not have been submitted to the jury, and thus the jury verdict cannot stand.	0.42306870400144697
	As I have discussed, the Lear Siegler requirements of "particularized testimony and linking argument" in jury trials are in conflict with Graver Tank, 339 U.S. at 609, 70 S.Ct. at 856, 85 USPQ at 331, wherein the Court made clear that proof of equivalence "can be made in any form".	0.41887368867204966
	Approximately seven months later, while decision on the JNOV motion was still pending, this court decided the case of Lear Siegler Inc. v. Sealy Mattress Co., 873 F.2d 1422, 10 USPQ2d 1767 (Fed.Cir.1989).	0.41499492500850876
	Graver Tank was not tried to a jury.	0.4075205058660047
	If Lear Siegler added gloss thereto, it was on peripheral points not dispositive here, such as the requirement of "testimony" (as opposed to other forms of evidence) and "linking argument" (which, being only attorney assertions, is of course not evidence at all).	0.40311363771462166
	In Lear Siegler, 873 F.2d at 1425-26, 10 USPQ2d at 1770, this court clarified a specific requirement that must be met before the question of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents may be submitted to the trier of fact for decision.	0.3975670105990687
	Thus, Lear Siegler requires that before a case may be submitted to a jury, a patentee's proof must include substantial evidence of separate and explicit comparison of the claimed and accused devices as to each of the three Graver Tank requirements.	0.3967992883286527

	Continental Ore Co., 370 U.S. at 696,	0.3904494172014776
	The issue before the jury was simply the equivalence of the two sets of known striking surfaces that were described in the patent.	0.3898780207051267
	However, as noted in the previous two sections, Lear Siegler merely requires that a patentee prove all elements of his case, which, with respect to the doctrine of equivalents, means that a patentee must prove that each prong of the Graver Tank equivalency test is met.	0.3848725774800962
	CONCLUSION Generally speaking, both the purpose and effect of the rule of Lear Siegler are to minimize the risk that a jury will find infringement under the doctrine of equivalents merely because one or two of the three Graver Tank requirements is met, ignoring the other(s) or blindly assuming the other(s) must be met, too.	0.3790047026040539

	the [defendants'] motion for judgment n.o.v. must be granted".	0.374952029567791
	Lear Siegler itself described this aspect of Nestier as dictum, for in Nestier the issue of equivalency was waived at trial, and this court held on appeal simply that it was not error for the trial court to have refused to give a jury instruction on an issue that was not before the jury. "	0.36802115478585035
	Malta's proofs lack evidence to prove either that all three prongs of the Graver Tank test are met or that the "buttons" limitation was met equivalently.	0.3621888217000925
	As the court noted in Lear Siegler, such proof is necessary to prevent the jury from being "put to sea without guiding charts," and from determining infringement by simply comparing the claimed invention and the accused device "as to overall similarity".	0.361820047248749
	The witness also explained "why", describing the felt surfaces, the slotted plastic, and the solid surfaces:	0.3565282381543792
	While Judge Rich's opinion relies primarily on statements in Nestier Corp., decided before the trial of this case, as first setting forth the requirement restated in Lear Siegler, decided after this trial, to overcome the dissent's argument on retroactivity, there is a simpler answer.	0.3408691554868933

	However, what is clearly lacking in that testimony is a sufficient explanation of both why the overall function, way, and result of the accused device are substantially the same as those of the claimed device and why the plastic/slotted plastic/felt arrangement is the equivalent of the claimed buttons limitation.	0.3031971296802734
