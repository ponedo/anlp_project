	Mr. Schulman did not know that the doses of the Debrie LMWH and the Mardiguian LMWH were different.	4.764747169866271
	Half-life data for the EP	3.775287393837094
	Further, Dr. Uzan stated that he analyzed the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 product and found that 21% of the chains had a MW lower than 2,000; 6% of the chains had a MW greater than 8,000; and 73% of the chains had a MW between 2,000 and 8,000.	3.275435194581028
	The Debrie LMWH in subsection 1 indicates two dosages.	3.0460151441996075
	Dr. Uzan was asked to compare the superior pharmacokinetic properties of the Debrie LMWH over the Mardiguian LMWH prior art compound.	2.819883424387069
	All of the evidence directed to the EP ï¿½ï¿½ 144 reference appears in ?	2.5632351726355465
	Specifically, Dr. Uzan assembled data from various clinical studies comparing the half-lives of the Debrie LMWH to a prior art LMWH invented by Mardiguian (Mardiguian LMWH).	2.361589173738187
	The USPTO determined that the Debrie LMWH was inventive over the prior art Mardiguian LMWH without relying on the controversial half-life data from example 6.	2.335279751712605
	The EP ï¿½ï¿½144 patent is not limited by a specific ratio of constituents.	2.1815277687259456
	With respect to anticipation, Aventis argued that EP ï¿½ï¿½144 does not expressly state that the mixture contains two types of polysaccharides, one with a MW less than 2,000 daltons and one with a MW greater than 8,000 daltons, nor does it state the number average/weight average MW ratio.	2.1753367591832395
	Aventis argued, in its response, that EP ï¿½ï¿½144 does not suggest compounds containing polysaccharides of the claimed MW in the claimed proportions and that the examiner improperly relied on inherency to reject the claimed compounds over EP ï¿½ï¿½144.	2.1654252962074976
	Without question, Dr. Uzan should have disclosed the dosage of the Mardiguian LMWH in example 6 subsection 3.	2.1382209723763803
	the formulations of [EP ï¿½ï¿½144] are clearly outside the scope of the present invention"-refers only to the MW distribution data and not to the half-life data.	2.053793806511023
	With respect to obviousness, Aventis argued that the claimed compounds are non-obvious over EP ï¿½ï¿½144 because the compositions in EP ï¿½ï¿½144 did not exhibit the unexpected properties of the claimed combination of MW chains.	2.050948848177765
	For the compound of [EP ï¿½ï¿½144], T 1/2 was 3.33 ï¿½ï¿½ 0.2," and the statistical analysis showed that 4.36 and 3.33 were statistically significant.	2.0417244506327177
	In Dr. Uzan's second declaration, he clearly articulated that the half-life data showed superior properties of the Debrie LMWH over the prior art Mardiguian LMWH.	1.995650220472401
	Thus, the central question throughout the prosecution of the ï¿½ï¿½618 patent was whether the [claimed] and [the] EP ï¿½ï¿½144 LMWH products were compositionally different.	1.953882223303796
	ï¿½ï¿½ 102(b)/103 over several references, including European Patent 40,144 ("EP ï¿½ï¿½144").	1.8995819917522516
	Likewise, Dr. Uzan ought to have disclosed to the USPTO that he compared the 60 mg dose of the prior art Mardiguian LMWH to the 40 mg dose of the Debrie LMWH in the declaration he submitted on March 29, 1993.	1.8986538294362414
	In ? 8 of the declaration, Dr. Uzan distinguished the claimed formulations from the formulations in EP ï¿½ï¿½144.	1.850191023967765
	According to the examiner, EP ï¿½ï¿½144 teaches "admixtures of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides having molecular weight ranges which are not patentably distinct from those of the instant claims".4	1.7486450574561208
	A heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides, such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight less than that of heparin and said admixture consisting essentially of from 9% to 20% of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight less than 2,000 daltons from 5% to 20% of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight greater than 8,000 daltons, and from 60-86% of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight of between 2,000 and 8,000 daltons,	1.735156875437855
	The mean half-life of 3.33 for the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 compound was taken from Table III, which did not mention the dosage.	1.6053747392871063
	The court further noted that the 60 mg dose of the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 composition was the only dose for which there was half-life data available.	1.5773670546402032
	Further, Aventis contends, Dr. Uzan's statement at the end of the declaration that "the formulations of [EP ï¿½ï¿½144] are outside the scope of the claimed invention," was based on the MW distribution analysis, not the half-life comparisons.	1.5372808642525446
	Aventis contends that Dr. Uzan selected the 40 mg dose for the patented compound and the 60 mg dose for the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 compound because they were the clinically relevant doses.	1.4824969169021638
	Instead, Aventis argues, the MW distribution analysis in the first Uzan declaration, showing a difference between the claimed compounds and those disclosed in EP ï¿½ï¿½144 in the proportion of chains of a given MW, was directed to the anticipation rejection; the half-life comparisons were directed to the obviousness rejection.	1.438065124564856
	A heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides, such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight less that that of heparin and which comprise from 9% to 20% of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight less than 2,000 daltons and from 5% to 20% of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight greater than 8,000 daltons, the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight thereof ranging from 1.3 to 1.6.	1.3371444446089373
	Finally, he concluded that "the formulations of [EP ï¿½ï¿½144] are clearly outside the scope of the present invention".	1.2872052785617318
	With respect to the half-life comparisons between the claimed compounds and EP ï¿½ï¿½144, the examiner stated that the "applicant has failed to provide evidence that the alleged difference between the half-life of the [EP ï¿½ï¿½ 144] product and that of the [claimed] mixture is statistically significant".	1.2840044399586403
	A heterogeneous intimate admixture of sulfated heparinic polysaccharides, such sulfated polysaccharides having a weight average molecular weight less that that of heparin and said admixture comprising [3] from 9% to 20% of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight less than 2,000 daltons from 5% to 20% of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight greater than 8,000 daltons, and from 60-86% of polysaccharide chains having a molecular weight of between 2,000 and 8,000 daltons, the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight thereof ranging from 1.3 to 1.6, said admixture (i) exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic activity greater than heparin and (ii) having an average molecular weight of between approximately 3,500 and 5,500 daltons.	1.2768058250785248
	Based on the example, Aventis argued that the claimed LMWHs exhibit a significantly longer half-life than formulations prepared in accordance with EP ï¿½ï¿½144.	1.2528698461082364
	Moreover, Dr. Uzan failed to disclose, in either example 6 or the first Uzan declaration, the dosage information for the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 compound.	1.2432076468754059
	Therefore, Aventis averred, the claimed compounds have been shown to differ from the compounds of EP ï¿½ï¿½144 in both their structure and properties.	1.2213277975646306
	When the product was prepared according to the process described in European Patent EP 40,144, the half-life was longer than 4 1/2 hours in 17% of the cases.	1.1931287023255892
	The examiner continued to reject the claims under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 103 over EP ï¿½ï¿½144 "for the reasons of record in" the second office action.	1.1864757668813708
	The examiner reiterated that the MW requirements of the claimed compounds are within the range of the compounds disclosed in EP ï¿½ï¿½144 and that any properties would be inherent in the prior art compounds because they have the same structure as the claimed compounds.2	1.179816992156635
	Referring to the second Uzan declaration, Aventis asserted that different half-lives are obtained with the claimed preparation as compared to the preparation of EP ï¿½ï¿½144.	1.1643508257295463
	In this case, Dr. Uzan, Associate Director of Biological Research at Aventis, assisted in the prosecution of the application that led to U.S. Patent No. 5,389,618 (ï¿½ï¿½618) covering a low molecular weight heparin mixture invented by Roger Debrie (Debrie LMWH).	1.142583302113333
	Specifically, Amphastar averred that Dr. Uzan engaged in inequitable conduct by failing to disclose that the half-life studies comparing the patented compound to the EP ï¿½ï¿½ 144 compound were at different doses.	1.1300264450225606
	In ? 3 of the declaration, Dr. Uzan referenced five tables comprising the raw data from the half-life comparisons between the claimed compound and the EP	1.1128356652013967
	Aventis relied on example 6 and the first Uzan declaration to address the anticipation rejection, arguing that the compounds disclosed in EP ï¿½ï¿½144 are not inherently the same as the claimed compounds because the claimed compounds have a longer half-life and because compounds prepared in accordance with EP ï¿½ï¿½144 fall outside the scope of the claims.	1.0568585758837363
	Aventis next argues that the district court clearly erred in excluding evidence that comparison of half-lives at different doses was the standard practice in the LMWH field.	1.0439348082764583
	In particular, we held that the reasonableness of the comparison at different doses is relevant to determining whether there was an intent to deceive in withholding the dosage of the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 composition.	1.043712776929495
	First, he noted that the half-life of the claimed formulation is greater than 4 1/2 hours 45% of the time, as compared to the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 formulation which achieved such a half-life only 17% of the time.	1.0361599592839574
	The examiner stated that each of the prior art references teaches sulfated heparinic admixtures within the molecular weight ("MW") range of the claims and is considered to be inherently the same as the claimed admixtures.	1.0270827163462162
	ï¿½ï¿½144 compound, which tables were attached to the declaration.5 Dr. Uzan also provided results from a statistical analysis showing a statistically significant difference between the mean half-life for the claimed compound and that of the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 compound.	0.9752785356688767
	Pharmaceutical company brought action for infringement of patent that claimed range of defined low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) mixtures, and its replacement.	0.9301638169752969
	According to Aventis, the district court improperly concluded that Aventis could not establish compositional differences with the MW distribution analysis, so it relied instead on the half-life comparisons to show that the compounds were not identical.	0.9161620201861386
	Thereafter, the court issued its opinion, considering the principle explanations proffered by Aventis for Dr. Uzan's failure to disclose the dose of the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 composition in its half-life comparisons.	0.8882213012122447
	In example 6, half-life data for the patented compound at the 4 1/2 hour cut-off, which could be readily compared to the 4 1/2 hour cut-off data for the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 compound, were only provided at the 40 mg dose.	0.8689068109582966
	Further, the examiner contended that the first Uzan declaration showed that the differences in composition based on MW were minimal and there was no showing of any unexpected results.	0.837258641916734
	The court noted that the examiner recognized that a compound's properties, e.g., half-life, are inherent in its composition and thereby rejected the claims as anticipated by the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 compound under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 102.	0.8143445928855781
	Therefore, we cannot agree that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence that comparison of half-lives at different doses to demonstrate a difference in property was routine practice in the LMWH field.	0.8097520193237085
	In support, Aventis relies on other evidence of inadvertent and benign mistakes made during prosecution of the ï¿½ï¿½618 patent application, suggesting that its omission of the dose of the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 compound was likewise inadvertent.	0.7727521878806917
	Therefore, we concluded that the withholding of the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 dosage information prevented the examiner from considering information important to patentability and constituted a failure to disclose material information.	0.7560212760811558
	Hence, Aventis urges, the examiner clearly withdrew the ï¿½ï¿½ 102 rejection based on the MW distribution data, and the half-life data in the second Uzan declaration was intended only to overcome the ï¿½ï¿½ 103 rejection.	0.7405657507792001
	Mr. Schulman had no way of knowing that the comparison was at two different doses and therefore the impropriety of using that data to demonstrate compositional difference.	0.7390726333801511
	The district court's inference was reasonable-by failing to disclose that the EP 40,144 data was at a 60 mg dose, Aventis may have been painting the rosiest picture possible as to the half-life improvement of its claimed compounds in an attempt to deceive the examiner....	0.7355194178294079
	Aventis's argument is premised on the fact that while a half-life comparison must be done using equivalent doses to establish a compositional difference, a half-life comparison may be done using different doses if the purpose is to establish a difference in property.	0.7296581165001146
	that there was not nearly as significant a difference, or no difference at all, in half-life when any other dose (i.e., 20 mg, 60 mg, or 80 mg) of the patented compound was compared to the 60 mg dose of EP ï¿½ï¿½144; and that there was no evidence corroborating Dr. Uzan's testimony that he selected the 40 mg dose due to its efficacy in preventing DVT.11 Id. at 986-89.	0.7221012476569858
	Furthermore, the court rejected Dr. Uzan's clinically-relevant dose justification on the grounds that it was incredible because: (1) there was no statistical difference in half-lives when the 60 mg dose of EP ï¿½ï¿½144 composition was compared to the patented composition at a 20 mg, 60 mg or 80 mg dose, i.e., there was a statistical difference only when a 40 mg dose of the patented composition was compared; (2) the ï¿½ï¿½618 patent was not limited to safe and effective doses for particular therapeutic indications; (3) there were a number of preferred therapeutic doses for the patented composition; and (4) Aventis offered no corroborating evidence to support Dr. Uzan's clinically relevant dose justification.	0.7107543970834022
	The "clinically relevant dose," Aventis avers, is the standard dose for comparison of half-lives, and every contemporaneous publication comparing half-lives did so at the clinically relevant doses, even though those doses may have differed.	0.6941693247829571
	Also, the examiner stated that the rejection over EP ï¿½ï¿½144 was "repeated for the reasons of record," and reiterated that any properties were considered to be inherent in the prior art compounds, making the record somewhat ambiguous.	0.6933079526311482
	While this court found that the dosage of the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 composition was indeed information material to patentability, we held that the district court erred in finding intent to deceive on summary judgment.	0.6874921447304422
	The court understood that, based on the information available to her, the examiner viewed the patented composition and the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 composition to be inherently the same, or nearly the same, and, because the Patent Office did not have the facilities to test the products, the examiner invited Aventis to provide evidence of a difference in property to show a compositional difference.	0.6868411793996342
	In example 6, Aventis urges, Dr. Uzan provided half-life data for the patented compound at 60 mg as well as at 40 mg; and, in the second Uzan declaration, he attached the raw half-life data for the patented compound in Table XI, which showed that the half-life of the patented compound was less at a 60 mg dose than at the 40 mg dose that was used in the comparison with the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 compound.	0.6865972998301354
	The patents are directed to a composition comprising low molecular weight heparins ("LMWHs").	0.6859905552295624
	Id. at 980 ("It also relied on [the claimed composition's] properties to rebut obviousness".), ("Because the ratio identified by [the claimed] LMWH exhibited superior properties over EP ï¿½ï¿½144, the inventive formulation could neither be inherent nor obvious".), ("This signaled to Aventis that its reliance on biochemical properties held promise for overcoming both the [primary examiner's] inherency and obviousness rejections".) (emphases added).	0.6846324882715084
	For example, Aventis points out that the first Uzan declaration mistakenly stated that the claimed compound had 1.5% of chains below a specified MW, whereas the remarks by Aventis in its response stated 31.5% of the chains.	0.6508862419341593
	Aventis contends that the district court made two clearly erroneous findings of fact: (1) that the central question relating to patentability was compositional differences, and (2) that the purpose of Dr. Uzan's half-life comparisons was to show compositional differences.	0.6403736992005444
	Even if the Court were to accept as true Aventis's unlikely contention that, by the time of Dr. Uzan's Second Declaration, the [primary examiner] had conceded that the [claimed] and EP ï¿½ï¿½144 products were different, there can be no question that inherency was the central, dispositive question up to that point.	0.6198378323902275
	First, evidence of industry practice of clinically-relevant doses would only be pertinent if there was a finding that the half-life comparisons were used to address obviousness, and not anticipation, because Aventis has conceded that half-life comparisons must be at the same dose to show compositional differences.	0.6190511317002465
	unenforceable.6	0.6012781574790184
	indications;10	0.6012781574790184
	These explanations were that: (1) comparison of half-lives at different doses was reasonable because it was customary to compare the half-lives of different drugs at the "clinically relevant dose," i.e., the dose presenting the best efficacy-safety ratio, and the half-life comparisons were intended to show a difference in therapeutic properties, not a compositional difference; (2) comparison of half-lives at different doses was reasonable because half-lives are dose independent; and (3) the failure to disclose was due merely to inadvertence.	0.5897005771023206
	the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight thereof ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 said admixture (i) exhibiting a bioavailability and antithrombotic activity greater than heparin and (ii) having an average molecular weight of between approximately 3,500 and 5,500 daltons.	0.5841911513814678
	The district court determined that the representation by Aventis that the patented compound had an improved half-life as compared to the EP ï¿½ï¿½144 compound was material to patentability because Aventis referred to the improved half-life at least four times during prosecution and the examiner ultimately allowed the ï¿½ï¿½618 patent application after the final representation that the difference in mean half-life was statistically significant.	0.5792966554882615
	60 mg dose: in 75% of the cases, the half-life was longer than 3.7 hours. (3)	0.555619506717391
	During oral argument, Aventis emphasized that the district court referred to compositional differences nineteen times in its opinion.	0.5092763712617999
	Evidence of industry practice using clinically relevant doses would have no impact on the court's credibility determination with respect to whether Dr. Uzan intended the clinically relevant doses in this case.	0.5035698447173598
	With regard to the obviousness portion of the rejection, Aventis contended that, under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 103, the prior art must suggest the modification to one of skill in the art, yet EP ï¿½ï¿½144 provides absolutely no suggestion to select the particular combination of oligosaccharide chains of specified lengths as claimed.	0.4928189035113201
	We cannot agree that the district court clearly erred in its determination that the half-life comparisons were, at least in part, intended to show compositional differences.	0.48239535386610166
	The essence of Aventis's argument is that the reason that Dr. Uzan did not disclose the dosage of the prior art compound in his half-life comparisons is that the comparisons were not being used to show a compositional difference and, therefore, the dosage information was not material.	0.4665941669125263
	Id. On appeal, Aventis argued that the district court erred in finding materiality because if the dose information were material to patentability, the examiner would have requested it because: she was presented with half-life data that enabled her to compare various doses, Dr. Uzan informed the examiner that the half-life comparison was done at different doses, those of skill in the art frequently compare half-lives at different doses, and half-life is independent of dose.	0.46048077121356185
	Here, however, the district court found, and we have affirmed, that the half-life comparisons were at least in part intended to show compositional differences to address the anticipation rejection.	0.45716000780517035
	Aventis next contends that the district court clearly erred in finding that the purpose of Dr. Uzan's half-life comparison was to show compositional differences to address the anticipation rejection under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 102.	0.4569027747664474
	According to Aventis, coursing throughout the district court's opinion is the notion that the central question relating to patentability was compositional differences.	0.456850055731432
	In submitting the data, Dr. Uzan did not draw attention to the different doses in those studies.	0.44533110240162066
	Half-life data for the patented compound were contained in Tables I, X, and XI.	0.44483902059744934
	Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly found that the half-life comparisons were intended to address both the anticipation and obviousness rejections, and, to the extent that they were intended to address the anticipation rejection, the failure to disclose the dosage information evidenced intent to deceive.8  Aventis further contends that, in the third office action, the examiner withdrew the ï¿½ï¿½ 102 rejection and maintained only the ï¿½ï¿½ 103 rejection over EP ï¿½ï¿½144.	0.44324836137009826
	Furthermore, the district court, after examining all of the evidence, found it simply incredible that Dr. Uzan selected the clinically relevant doses for his half-life comparisons.	0.4349321515178179
	We also rejected Aventis's explanation for nondisclosure that using different doses in half-life comparisons was common practice in the field because, in contrast to the references cited in support of this proposition, Aventis did not disclose the actual doses.	0.42723244556646717
	., Inc., 390 F.Supp.2d 952, 954 (C.D.Cal.2005)	0.405672839491556
	Even if we acknowledge that half-life data at other doses for the patented compound were provided to the examiner, the data were provided in a very misleading way.	0.40500085124119206
	The court found a strong inference of intent to deceive because it could find no credible explanation for comparing half-lives at different doses and because comparisons at the same dose showed little difference in half-life.	0.39409084526665866
	In sum, we find that the district court did not clearly err in determining that the half-life comparisons were, in part, intended to show compositional differences to address the anticipation rejection under 35 U.S.C.	0.3924627601208627
	We left open the possibility, however, that Dr. Uzan may have intended by this statement to convey to the examiner that the half-life comparisons were done at different doses.	0.3899844744645836
	According to Aventis, Dr. Uzan's half-life comparisons were intended to show a difference in properties in response to the obviousness rejection under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 103, not to demonstrate a compositional difference to address the anticipation rejection under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 102, as the district court concluded.	0.3767949307466189
	The district court found Dr. Uzan's clinical relevance justification implausible because such a justification presumed a compositional difference between the compounds being compared, yet the issue of inherency was repeatedly raised by the examiner during prosecution.	0.37144839795555856
	The mean half-life of 4.36 for the claimed compound was taken from Table X, which indicated the dosage to be 40 mg.	0.36355955915538407
	According to the specification, the advantage of the claimed LMWHs as compared to heparin is that they exhibit a longer half-life, excellent bioavailability, higher rate of absorption, low clearance, resistance to degradation, increased residence time, and reduced sensitivity to serum factors.	0.35885947393723916
	To support the argument that Dr. Uzan informed the examiner that the half-life comparisons were done at different doses, Aventis relied on the statement in the first Uzan declaration that "this represents an increase in 250% in the half life and is very significant because it enables the same effect to be achieved with lower dosages," and Dr. Uzan's deposition testimony stating that he believed this to mean "that the comparison is a comparison between two doses of which one is lower than the other".	0.34527373411930756
	40 mg dose: in 75% of the cases, the half-life was longer than 4 hours, and was even longer than 4 1/2 hours in approximately 45% of the cases;	0.34212580693889155
	Unfortunately, the Foquet study chart that Dr. Uzan used did not show the dosage information.	0.33304945938397035
	The half-life data were apparently not even necessary for patentability.	0.3286769500336179
	Yet, Aventis asserts, it was not until the second Uzan declaration, which was submitted after the third office action, that Dr. Uzan provided a statistical analysis showing that the half-life differences were statistically significant.	0.3276303935442672

	117,reversed and remanded.	0.3029801112301896
	With regard to materiality, this court held that it was not plausible to read the statement in the first Uzan declaration as indicating to the examiner that the half-life comparison was done at different doses and, therefore, there was no genuine issue of material fact that Dr. Uzan did not disclose that the comparison was made using data for the two compounds at different doses.	0.3028418449845712
	at 3:9-3:17, available at http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oralarguments/mp3/2007-1280.mp3.	0.30091199235488514
	We cannot find that the district court clearly erred in concluding that other evidence outweighed Dr. Uzan's testimony that he intended by this statement to inform the examiner that the half-life comparisons were done at different doses.	0.3005084182647576
	First, Aventis argues that the court erred in not considering exculpatory testimony by Dr. Uzan indicating that he believed that he informed the examiner that he was comparing half-lives at different doses when he stated, in the first Uzan declaration: "This represents an increase in 250% in the half life and is very significant because it enables the same effect to be achieved with lower dosages".	0.29113578412124425
	The dosage information was not on the original Foquet chart submitted to the Aventis patent department and Dr. Uzan neglected to add it.	0.2883102697380871
	Dr. Uzan submitted this data, from the Duchier study and the Foquet study respectively, as example 6 of the patent.	0.2823516678296966
	We note that in its first appeal, Aventis argued only that Dr. Uzan did not have deceptive intent in failing to disclose the dosage information because he thought he informed the examiner that the comparisons were done at different doses, and because he did provide half-life data for the claimed compound at 60 mg as well as at 40 mg.	0.27486361076708216
	Aventis further argued lack of intent based on the fact that Dr. Uzan submitted half-life data for the claimed compound at 60 mg, as well as at 40 mg.	0.2734261631988747
	The court was similarly unpersuaded by Aventis's dose-independence argument because the evidence did not establish that the half-lives were dose-independent, given the high intra-subject variability.	0.26446512491148577
	According to Aventis, the 40 mg dose for the patented compound was the approved dose for its most important indication, namely, prevention of deep venous thrombosis ("DVT") during high-risk orthopedic surgery.	0.2644283571637825
	However, there is another reasonable inference-namely, as Aventis argues, if the comparison between different doses was reasonable, the failure to disclose may have been due purely to inadvertence.	0.26327213328319643
	Thus, the absence of a dosage in subsection 3 is blatantly obvious.	0.25618442165090577
	Further, this court did not accept the explanation that the half-life data were dose independent because the evidence clearly suggested otherwise.	0.25582130167406364
	Now, on its second time on appeal, Aventis offers a new justification for Dr. Uzan's failure to disclose the dosage information in his half-life comparisons.7	0.2544233366693446
	Surely if Dr. Uzan had intended to deceive the USPTO, he would not have made this omission so conspicuous.	0.24616496638448482
	Dosage is an element in subsections 2 and 4 as well.	0.23366978807939148
	In the first Uzan declaration, reference was made only to the half-life comparison at the 4 1/2 hour cut-off, without reference to the dosage of the patented compound.	0.22872234420094528
	He remarked, "This represents an increase in 250% in the half life and is very significant because it enables the same effect to be achieved with lower dosages".	0.22828149199016023
	This example illustrates the increase in stability, in vivo, of the mixtures of the invention, expressed by their plasma half-life. (1)	0.2228482048646869
	Still, with all information before the USPTO, the examiner allowed the patent.	0.2205155778035768
	In particular, the court noted that neither the claims nor the specification were limited to prevention of DVT in high-risk surgical patients and that the patented composition could be used at several different doses for several different	0.21816966222583783
	475 F.Supp.2d 970, 975 (C.D.Cal.2007) ("Aventis III ").	0.2142759778309705
	This court already concluded in the prior appeal, "that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Dr. Uzan did not disclose in this statement that the comparison was made using data from different doses".	0.21176625156800377
	applicant's failure to disclose dosage information evidenced intent to deceive examiner to extent that such information intended to address anticipation rejection; any error by court in concluding that anticipation was still at issue in third office action did not diminish prior evidence of intent to deceive; evidence of industry practice of clinically-relevant doses could be excluded as irrelevant to reasonableness of applicant's alleged material intentional withholding of particular dosage information through concealment; exculpatory testimony of applicant could be outweighed by other evidence of applicant's deceptive intent; disclosure of half-life data at other doses for compound that was provided to examiner in very misleading way did not diminish applicant's material intentional withholding of dosage information through concealment; and inadvertent errors that applicant made during prosecution of application for patent did not diminish applicant's material intentional withholding of dosage information through concealment.	0.20577938143059976
	Nothing in example 6 suggests that the half-life comparison was designed to show only non-obviousness and not lack of identity.	0.1972326509494857

	Comparison of drug properties at their clinically relevant (and different) dosages is, of course, completely appropriate.	0.19422856273883538
	Therefore, the court was not persuaded that Dr. Uzan presented the half-life comparisons to show only a difference in property and not also a difference in composition.	0.18649396580779845

	Presuming, therefore, that the examiner's anticipation rejection rested on inherency, Aventis argued that the evidence in the specification rebuts inherency.	0.16148420021847268
	Lastly, Aventis contends that Dr. Uzan's failure to disclose the dosage information was purely due to inadvertence.	0.15860464764417617

	While it is indeed true that Mr. Schulman represented to the examiner that the difference in half-life indicated that the compositions were different, we find nothing to suggest that the district court relied entirely, or in large part, on Mr. Schulman's statements in determining that Dr. Uzan intended to deceive the examiner by his failure to disclose the dosage information in his half-life comparisons.	0.15214956437723665
	Dr. Uzan admitted that he inadvertently neglected to add that information to the graphs.	0.14648642277753313
	Finally, the court declined to find that Dr. Uzan's failure to disclose the difference in doses could be justified based on inadvertence because it was not credible that a scientist with Dr. Uzan's qualifications could have committed, and failed to correct during a lengthy prosecution, such an egregious error, and there was a complete absence of evidence suggesting negligence throughout prosecution.	0.1427559834239751

	Again, this oversight may have been careless, but hardly culpable.	0.140659875085877
	As the district court points out, Dr. Uzan has had a magnificent fifty year career with Aventis, has published over 350 scientific articles and has received numerous prestigious awards including the Galien Research Prize, France's highest award for drug discovery.	0.1391349200433735
	Instead this court required "culpable" conduct supported by clear and convincing evidence of intent to deceive the USPTO.	0.13803704793727536
	In light of the rejuvenation of the inequitable conduct tactic, this court ought to revisit occasionally its Kingsdown opinion.	0.13764424438305298
	Moreover, I find it difficult to fathom that a scientist of Dr. Uzan's caliber and reputation would engage in such deception.	0.13720620690126906
	Aventis went on to explain that, because it is well established that compounds are inseparable from their properties, the evidence of a difference in a property, i.e., half-life, serves as evidence of a difference in structure.	0.13709256002657108
	With burgeoning application rates, the USPTO must rely on applicant submissions to narrow the prior art search.	0.13304316685548404
	In our earlier opinion, we held that the dosage of the prior art composition used in half-life comparisons with the patented composition was information material to patentability, but we remanded to the district court to determine whether there was an intent to deceive by Aventis in failing to disclose the dosage.	0.13283982960624124
	Dr. Uzan testified that the different dose "did not come to his mind".	0.1290877257834146
	Any error by the court in concluding that anticipation was still at issue in the third office action does not override the evidence of intent to deceive based on the failure to disclose dosage information in the half-life comparisons in example 6 of the specification and in the first Uzan declaration, both of which were submitted prior to the third office action.	0.126886986251439

	Nevertheless, because materiality and intent to deceive are necessarily intertwined, Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Johnson & Johnson, 745 F.2d 1437, 1455 (Fed.Cir.1984), we will consider the merits of Aventis's argument with respect to deceptive intent.	0.05885121570911646

	However, whether a superior property need be demonstrated throughout the entire claim scope in order to show nonobviousness of a claimed product over a prior art product is a separate question from whether there was deceptive intent in failing to disclose material dosage information in a comparison between the claimed product and the prior art product when there is nothing in the claims or specification to suggest that the dosage of the claimed product was the dosage used for a particular purpose.	0.05475980075090185

	The district court excluded the evidence of industry practice because it determined that such evidence was irrelevant to the reasonableness of Dr. Uzan's nondisclosure.	0.047502298345903325
	Still this miscarriage rendered the entire patent unenforceable.	0.04543681948127673

	Aventis thus avers that the district court erred in concluding that the anticipation rejection was still pending at the time of the third office action.	0.04006929935623798
	The district court heard Dr. Uzan's testimony and considered it along with all other evidence relevant to deceptive intent, yet determined that it did not outweigh the cumulative evidence evincing an intent to deceive.	0.03982022570607756
