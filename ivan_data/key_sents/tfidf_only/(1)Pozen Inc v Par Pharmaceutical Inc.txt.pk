	Par and DRL provided expert testimony to show that the sumatriptan dissolves completely and independently from the naproxen and that the naproxen dissolves completely and independently from the sumatriptan in their ANDA products.	5.188400576753688
	The tablet of claim 1, wherein said naproxen is in the form of naproxen sodium between 200 and 600 mg.	5.177276882986661
	The district court did not clearly err in finding that Catarci does not teach a combination of sumatriptan and naproxen	5.118623661034151
	It is undisputed that the first layer of Par's ANDA tablet "contains 100% of the tablet's sumatriptan, along with 15% of the tablet's naproxen, with the remaining 85% of the naproxen in the second layer. DRL's ANDA tablet has 100% of the tablet's naproxen and 15% of the tablet's sumatriptan in the first layer, with the remaining 85% of the sumatriptan in the second layer".	5.0778766498326675
	The result is that one layer has 100% of the sumatriptan with 15% of the naproxen, and another layer has the remaining 85% of the naproxen, substantially all separated and segregated into two layers.	5.069463072383797
¡°	Pozen developed a method for treating migraines by combining two drugs, sumatriptan and naproxen, in a single tablet.	5.048904533044918
	The parties agreed that the claim term "dissolution of said naproxen occurs independently of said triptan" means "dissolution of naproxen ... and triptan from the multilayer tablet ... occurs in the same amount of time ï¿½ï¿½ 10% as when the same amount of naproxen ... and triptan are given separately".	4.909090546355503
	Appellants argue that Catarci shows a concomitant administration of sumatriptan and naproxen was used to treat migraines as evidenced by the patient's prescription of a daily NSAID as a prophylactic with sumatriptan used as needed.	4.79617732904751
	Par's product has substantially all the required triptan in one layer along with 15% of the tablet's naproxen, but the second Par layer has less than 90% of naproxen.	4.7601041861525895
	The parties' experts agreed that the function was to have "separate, distinct layers of sumatriptan and naproxen. The way in which this function is achieved is by formulating the sumatriptan and naproxen in different manners to create physical barriers. The result is that substantially naproxen is separated from the [sumatriptan], thereby providing independent dissolution".	4.6728712328505315
	At least one of the patients' prescriptions was soon altered to sumatriptan and an antidepressant, suggesting the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen did not work to relieve migraine symptoms.	4.576903401871545
	While multilayer tablets were commonly used, Pozen's dosage forms of naproxen sodium and sumatriptan were not obvious.	4.555899334642581
	Sumatriptan	4.317861259595162
	Accordingly, Appellants assert, Saadah and Raskin together teach the simultaneous administration of sumatriptan and naproxen, rendering the ï¿½ï¿½ 499 and ï¿½ï¿½458 patents obvious.	4.274017524349163
	This is achieved by granulating 15% of the sumatriptan with a polymer binder and then spraying it on the naproxen which has been granulated with a polymer binder as well; the remaining 85% of the sumatriptan forms the other layer.	4.272497683714958
	Specifically, the district court reasoned that the references did not, separately or combined, "teach or suggest the simultaneous administration of sumatriptan and naproxen. Nor ... otherwise disclose to one of ordinary skill in the art that the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen produces a longer lasting efficacy reducing migraine relapse compared to the administration of naproxen or sumatriptan alone".	4.255190849649041
	It has substantially all the required naproxen in one layer, along with 15% of the triptan, but the second DRL layer has only 85% of the total triptan in the product.	4.00572949337679
	The parties agreed that the limitation "dissolution of said naproxen occurs independently of said triptan" as recited in claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½183 patent means "dissolution of naproxen ... and triptan from the multilayer tablet ... occurs in the same amount of time ï¿½ï¿½ 10% as when the same amount of naproxen ... and triptan are given separately" as it was described in the patent specification.	3.9589526142403773
	Catarci discloses that treating the patient's acute migraine attacks with either NSAID or sumatriptan was not beneficial.	3.9487232856904297
	The Parma Reference	3.8865274258371274
	The Catarci Reference	3.8865274258371274
	The ï¿½ï¿½183 patent claims a multilayer pharmaceutical tablet with a triptan, such as sumatriptan, and a NSAID in separate layers that dissolve independently.	3.8254247316657257
	Rather, Catarci concludes that the only effective treatment for this patient was sumatriptan and acupuncture.	3.7958394997727956
	The improvement, method, or composition of claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, wherein said 5-HT agonist is sumatriptan, said LA-NSAID is naproxen and the unit dosage form is an oral unit dosage form comprising sumatriptan in an amount greater than 15 mg, and naproxen in an amount greater than 200 mg.	3.7781757159014764
	FANS + antiemetics	3.776588595472863
	FANS + antidepressants	3.776588595472863
	It was not obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to formulate the naproxen sodium and sumatriptan into a bilayer configuration.	3.770634756931796
	Claim 2 calls for a multilayer pharmaceutical tablet comprising naproxen and a triptan wherein "substantially all of said triptan is in a first layer of said tablet and substantially all of said naproxen is in a second, separate layer".	3.729606539672606
	Instead the patient resumed taking a daily dose of sumatriptan in addition to acupuncture and successfully treated acute migraines with additional sumatriptan.	3.7057662943950915
	This claim language begged the question of how much by volume of both naproxen and triptan less than 100% is "substantially all".	3.6758482128589955
	The district court found that Par's ANDA product performs essentially the same function, by segregating the naproxen and sumatriptan into two layers.	3.637970434967235
	FANS + flunarizine	3.506464433394382
	provided migraine relief.	3.504080484436871
	Moreover, in its ANDA, Par represented to the FDA that the sumatriptan and naproxen in its ANDA product dissolves completely and independently from each other.	3.443109223023551
	The district court determined that Catarci discourages combining sumatriptan and naproxen to achieve the claimed efficacy benefits, teaching away from the invention.	3.4301632425747544
	Dr. Ramadan, who treated the patients at the clinic, testified that he did not recall ever prescribing or giving a patient sumatriptan and naproxen simultaneously.	3.406913554893506
	Specifically, Appellants contend that there is no proof that the independent dissolution achieved by the ANDA products was compared to dissolution rates of the same amount of naproxen or sumatriptan alone.	3.4021978390328727
	The Saadah Reference	3.3498761357388225
	This is achieved by formulating them differently, specifically, by using a polymer binder to form 15% of the naproxen into granules which are added to the sumatriptan layer.	3.287329800845978
	Therefore, Pozen argues, the formulation would result in sumatriptan monotherapy.	3.2438909344472378
	Pozen contends that a person of ordinary skill in the art motivated to substitute sumatriptan for ergotamine would remove not only metoclopramide and caffeine from the treatment plan but also naproxen because sumatriptan was recognized to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.	3.215505274017417
	The ï¿½ï¿½499 patent discloses several dosage forms, including an oral unit dosage, to teach treating migraines by concomitantly administering therapeutic amounts of sumatriptan and naproxen.	3.1698367461668493
	FANS + analgesics	3.1621834638293307
	Therefore, a person of ordinary skill in the art would use a multilayer tablet, which was well known, to resolve the physical incompatibility between sumatriptan and naproxen.	3.1451061889355643
	Raskin teaches that sumatriptan can be used as an anti-migraine without the concurrent use of anti-nausea agents.	3.1230946729373756
	Appellants further argue that the ï¿½ï¿½499 and ï¿½ï¿½458 patents should be invalid as obvious in light of the prior art, asserting that references Parma, Saadah, patient records from Henry Ford Hospital, or Catarci, alone or in combination, teach a "concomitant administration" of sumatriptan and naproxen to treat migraines.	3.1015111054806725
	The district court stated that the multilayer tablet claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½183 patent requires "substantially all of the naproxen and triptan [to be] segregated and separated for the purpose of independent dissolution".	3.039713738808236
	a) substantially all of said triptan is in a first layer of said tablet and substantially all of said naproxen is in a second, separate layer; and	3.024804001342278
	The district court found Appellants' ANDA products directly infringe claims 11, 12, and 24, which depend on claim 3, as well as claims 26, 27, 29, and 30, which specify sumatriptan is the 5-HT agonist and naproxen is the LA-NSAID used in various dosages.	2.985914908041426
	Pozen, in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline ("GSK"), markets a combination of sumatriptan and naproxen called Treximet THE-R and holds three related patents relevant to this appeal.	2.9770876867322396
	LA-NSAID or the administration of said LA-NSAID in the absence of said 5-HT agonist, and	2.9236399731008205
	LA-NSAID or the administration of said LA-NSAID in the absence of said 5-HT agonist.	2.9236399731008205
	Catarci describes a single patient who developed ergotamine-induced headaches and subsequently replaced ergotamine with daily administration of sumatriptan.	2.887595772534135
	Also, there is probative evidence from Par's ANDA and comparison of DRL's ANDA products dissolution profile showing that their sumatriptan and naproxen dissolve completely and independently from another.	2.8360636520528533
	Therefore, the district court properly limited its analysis of the prior art to whether the references taught simultaneous administration of naproxen and sumatriptan.	2.7984189521396763
	Catarci discloses that the patient was subsequently taken off of sumatriptan and NSAIDs were "prescribed both on a daily basis and when required".	2.7688686018766773

	The present claims require that naproxen and [sumatriptan] be in a tablet in which they are segregated from one another in a "side by side arrangement" and in which their dissolution occurs independently of one another.	2.6836183771016495
	The district court also found that DRL's ANDA product performs the same function of achieving separate, distinct layers by segregating the triptan and naproxen.	2.6797258429559756
	b)said first layer and said second layer are in a side by side arrangement such that the dissolution of said naproxen occurs independently of said triptan.	2.634373932918145
	Therefore, Appellants assert that when sumatriptan is taken in addition to a daily dose of naproxen the combination of the two drugs would have the same effect as when the two drugs are given simultaneously.	2.6207453262616403
	Sumatriptan, a 5-HT receptor agonist, was developed in the late 1980s and is widely accepted as an effective medicine for migraines, but it does not prevent the reoccurrence of migraine symptoms.	2.552271203961168
	So the question is whether 85% of naproxen is equivalent to 90%, when "substantially all" means "at least 90% and preferably greater than 95%."	2.5307105893723665
	Therefore, Appellants contend, a person of ordinary skill in the art would reasonably expect to successfully substitute sumatriptan for ergotamine, both 5-HT agonists, in the treatment plan disclosed by Saadah.	2.469672077251491
	Claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½183 patent requires "substantially all of said triptan is in the first layer of said tablet and substantially all of said naproxen is in a second, separate layer".	2.4576548032816388
	The Henry Ford Patient Records  Appellants present two patient records from the Henry Ford Clinic in Detroit, Michigan, showing doctors prescribed a daily dose of naproxen as a prophylactic treatment, and sumatriptan for treating acute migraines.	2.4547177699882656
	Furthermore, Appellants contend that in substituting sumatriptan for ergotamine, there would no longer be a need for antiemetics, so metoclopramide and caffeine would be unnecessary.	2.385936144097671
	ergotamine, which is a 5-HT agonist that at the time was a widely used anti-migraine agent; metoclopramide and caffeine to reduce nausea and improve "gastric emptying" which in turn leads to better absorption of anti-migraine agents; and naproxen for its pain and inflammation reduction effects.	2.3644939132993814
	Par argues the prior art taught that naproxen has very low solubility in acidic environments like the stomach, which would impede the dissolution of sumatriptan when the two are administered together in a single unit dose.	2.283407949960803
	One of the tables, labeled "Table VI. Combinations: 2 drugs," listed "FANS + sumatriptan" (FANS is the Italian abbreviation for NSAIDs) among fifteen other drug combinations for the treatment of migraines.	2.2788550865265895
	The district court held that after reading Saadah, it is not obvious that one could substitute sumatriptan for ergotamine and remove metoclopramide and caffeine as unnecessary.	2.2394513729836114
	Parma, E., et al., The Treatment of Migraine:	2.231968568453741
	Additionally, Appellants contend that a person of ordinary skill in the art would expect a daily dose of naproxen to have the same effectiveness as a single dose of naproxen taken when needed because concentration of the drug in the blood would be the same or higher.	2.1044712598944573
	N.H. Raskin's "Acute and Prophylactic Treatment of Migraine: Practical Approaches and Pharmacologic Rationale," ("Raskin") shows sumatriptan has beneficial effects on nausea, and can be used instead of ergotamine to treat migraines eliminating the need for a concurrent antiemetic.8	2.0943738932291898
	Furthermore, the district court found that Parma does not disclose anything about the combination of "FANS + sumatriptan" in particular reducing migraine relapse or producing longer lasting efficacy, nor does it disclose the dosage of the combination treatment.	2.034149242167895
	The court construed the phrase "substantially all of said triptan is in a first layer of said tablet and substantially all of said naproxen is in a second, separate layer" as meaning "at least 90%, and preferably greater than 95%, of the total triptan present in the tablet is included within one distinct layer and at least 90%, and preferably greater than 95%, of the naproxen present in the tablet is included within a second distinct layer".	2.0091827959451214

	The ï¿½ï¿½499 patent claims a method of treating migraines comprising co-timely administration of 5-HT agonists and long-acting NSAIDs.	1.9148268685096816
	Here, DRL contends, sumatriptan only makes up 85% of one layer; 5% less than the minimum 90% set forth in the construction of the term "substantially all".	1.821362804156772
	"At least 90%, and preferably greater than 95%, of the total triptan present in the tablet is included within one distinct layer and at least 90%, and preferably greater than 95%, of the naproxen present in the tablet is included within a second distinct layer".	1.7844659169885768
	We agree with the district court that the prior art would not have provided one of ordinary skill with motivation to combine sumatriptan and naproxen in order to benefit from longer lasting efficacy as compared to when either agent is taken alone.	1.7612255938528778
	Saadah disclosed each drug as having a specific purpose, and even though Raskin teaches that antiemetics are unnecessary with sumatriptan, Raskin does not provide the motivation to a skilled artisan to substitute one agent in place of three.	1.7310204425880285

Apotex, Inc., 480 F.3d 1348, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2007) ("The burden falls on the challenger of the patent to show by clear and convincing evidence that a skilled artisan would have been motivated to combine the teachings of the prior art references to achieve the claimed invention, and that the skilled artisan would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so".).	0.003577305510330292
	In assessing equivalents, the court considers whether "the accused products perform[ ] substantially the same function in substantially the same way with substantially the same result as each claim limitation of the patented product".	0.0035041030507241685
	See Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1314	0.003431015128614832
	The District Court, with no contest from Pozen, recognized that "substantially all" inherently contains a range from something less than 100% up to 100%.	0.0033220255794947063
	In Abbott Laboratories, the claim required between 68.8% and 94.5% by weight of a component, and the accused product had 95% of that component.	0.0033022062117416045
	That is why the patentee could not assert literal infringement of claim 2, and why he was forced to rely on the doctrine of equivalents to establish infringement.	0.0031375177754113586
	One way of proving infringement under the doctrine of equivalents "is by showing on a limitation by limitation basis that the accused product performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way with substantially the same result as each claim limitation of the patented product".	0.0029660818292984647

	The District Court answered the question, construing "substantially all" without objection to mean:	0.0023461867960298606
	The accused products do not literally meet the "substantially all" limitation.	0.00221504207017774
