	Thus both alizarine and artificial alizarines were known in the prior art.	2.7473394287682424
	The ï¿½ï¿½507 patent was not the first cefdinir patent.	2.472778998873531
	Lupin's generic product contains almost exclusively the Crystal B form of crystalline cefdinir (cefdinir monohydrate), whereas Abbott's Omnicef product contains the Crystal A form of crystalline cefdinir (cefdinir anhydrate).	2.1958455274132964
	The parties agree that the "bulk" of Lupin's cefdinir product is Crystal B, not Crystal A.	1.712425495137487
	Pure alizarine has the chemical formula C14H8 O4, but "artificial alizarines" available in the market at the time of the litigation varied from almost completely pure alizarine, to combinations of alizarine and anthrapurpurine, to pure purpurine containing no alizarine whatsoever.	1.7012183947333737
	In BASF, the Court considered a patent relating to artificial alizarine.	1.4064530493150176
	Claims 2-5 of the ï¿½ï¿½507 patent begin by reciting a product, crystalline cefdinir, and then recite a series of steps by which this product is "obtainable".	1.1273222391421465
	Thus we conclude that the plaintiffs deliberately excluded from the definition of Crystal A, cefdinir monohydrate, which is Crystal B".	1.1058589567826158

In contrast, claims 2-5 claim crystalline cefdinir, without any PXRD peak limitations, but with descriptions of processes used to obtain the crystalline cefdinir. Claims 2 and 5 are independent: 2. Crystalline 7-[2-(2-a minothiazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido]	0.9739965566879364
	Because the JP ï¿½ï¿½199 applications defines Crystal A and Crystal B physiochemically rather than structurally, the forms actually represent subgenuses of crystalline cefdinir.	0.9498313793744549
	The patent before the Court was a reissue patent that claimed artificial alizarine in the following way:	0.944928585814318
	See Cochrane v. Badische Anilin & Soda Fabrik, 111 U.S. 293,	0.9320474924271749
	PXRD is a method for identifying and distinguishing different crystalline compounds.	0.9206344973133328
	After all, if those claims are not bound by the process terms but only "define" the basic cefdinir compound, then each of the claims recite the same thing, over and over again.	0.9054186826705213
	Competitor brought action against patent licensee seeking declaratory judgment of non-infringement of patent for crystalline cefdinir.	0.8981454200406932
	The ï¿½ï¿½507 patent claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 62-206199 (the JP ï¿½ï¿½199 application), which claimed two crystalline forms of cefdinir, "Crystal A" and "Crystal B".	0.8729267178722174
	In turn, the specification generally described a method for making artificial alizarine involving anthracine or its derivatives.	0.8380302206483957
	However, BASF did not present the situation for which the expedient of necessity was created, for as the Court stated, the invention was "a process for preparing alizarine, not as a new substance prepared for the first time, but as the substance already known as alizarine, to be prepared, however, by the new process, which process is to be the subject of the patent, and is the process of preparing the known product alizarine from anthracine".	0.8270184470969407
	Rather, Astellas' prior art U.S. Patent No. 4,559,334 (the ï¿½ï¿½334 patent) describes the discovery of cefdinir as a compound demonstrating high antimicrobial activity.	0.8190881689436718

	The applicants chose not to claim Crystal B. Thus Crystal B compounds, most relevantly cefdinir monohydrate, fall outside the scope, literal or equivalent, of claims 1-5 of the ï¿½ï¿½507 patent.	0.749492278371191
	As additional support, the Northern District observed that there was no evidence that any trace amounts of cefdinir anhydrate, i.e. Crystal A, in Sandoz and Teva's products "could be a contributing factor in the efficacy" and that even "if there is a small amount of cefdinir anhydrate in defendants' products, we do not conclude that this could cause literal infringement".	0.7294366874427128
	Literal infringement of claim 1, i.e., whether Lupin's generic cefdinir product contains any Crystal A, is therefore not a live issue on appeal.	0.7213677123283287
	Calling it artificial alizarine did not make it a new composition of matter, and patentable as such, by reason of its having been prepared, artificially, for the first time, from anthracite, if it was set forth as alizarine, a well-known substance.	0.7127234985123946
	The Eastern District of Virginia therefore properly concluded on summary judgment that Lupin's cefdinir product did not infringe claims 1-5 literally or claims 2-5 by equivalency.	0.7061163319815911
	Had Astellas intended, in the chart found in column 1, to distinguish Crystal A from other forms of crystalline cefdinir that also fall within the scope of claim 1, it would have listed, at a minimum, an eighth peak associated only with Crystal A.	0.6834386393089698
	The Court held that since alizarine was a known product, the claim was limited to the patentee's two processes, stating:	0.6709469923340907
	A more sensitive form of X-ray diffraction is single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD).	0.6631405163877901

	Beyond the attempt to reinflate the claims to encompass Crystal B based on mathematical comparisons of the PXRD peak patterns of Crystal A and Crystal B, Abbott also asserts that Lupin effectively admitted infringement by equivalents when it claimed before the Food and Drug Administration that its cefdinir generic was a bioequivalent to Abbott's Omnicef product.	0.575612441736467

	Nonetheless, the parties hotly contest whether Example 14, which reports obtaining "crystals" not specifically identified or described, and/or Example 16 of the ï¿½ï¿½334 patent enable cefdinir monohydrate, i.e. Crystal B type crystals.	0.5659271957492322

	Of such a claim, wherein the product itself was anticipated but the process was new, the court stated "it would in that case not be infringed by anything but the product of the ... process".	0.0011241071587103717
	The en banc court also relies on Plummer v. Sargent, 120 U.S. 442,	0.00111646523247762
	The decision in Plummer is unrelated to any rule of claim construction based on whether process terms are included in the claim.	0.001092707528666856
	Along with the specification, the prosecution history is "intrinsic evidence" of the meaning of the claims, because it "provides evidence of how the [United States Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) ] and the inventor understood the patent".	0.001028257299392971
	As I next discuss, in most of the cited cases the product was not a new product and thus was not patentable as a product, whether or not any process term was included in the claim.	0.001028032365751014
	This court perceives that decision as well within the trial court's discretion.	0.000996328970768302
	The Court held this claim "invalid on its face" for failing to provide a "distinct and definite statement of what he claims to be new, and to be his invention".	0.0008705300616888111
	Indeed, this court itself had articulated that rule: "For this reason, even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the product itself".	0.0008683964597912414
	The claim in Plummer was for a "new manufacture," "substantially as described":	0.0008677804506857668
	The issue is the right to make the same product, by making a process change that does not change the product.	0.0008655901867811013
	That question has many answers, now stated to be irrelevant.	0.0008624833958397733
	The claim was thus a process claim, and no "product-by-process" issue was presented.	0.000831812957614529
	This claim had been rejected as an improper product-by-process claim, on the ground that the product could be described without including process steps.	0.0007959142842643577
	Review of these cases reveals no support for the en banc court's statement of their holdings.	0.000781366423961218
	The court holds that it is irrelevant whether the product is new or was known, irrelevant whether the product could have been fully described by its structure at the time of the patent application, irrelevant whether the particular invention is a new product or is actually a process.	0.0007797286025658949
	This court heard the cases together and decides them together with this decision.	0.000712637873139656
	It is not a product alone, separated from the process by which it is created".	0.0006914322289162907
	In addition, of course, in order to sustain any claim for infringement, a patent owner must prove that an accused product is the same as that covered by an asserted claim.	0.000640857874050979
	Further, Lupin makes its products with processes other than those claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½507 patent.	0.0006339437978430497
	Patentability was determined as a product, independent of any process reference in the claim, and validity and infringement were based on the product itself.	0.0006217981263564947
	For the first time, claims are construed differently for validity and for infringement.	0.0006162830883215233
	That is, such a product is not patented as a product, however it is produced, but is limited to the process by which it was obtained.	0.0006103179548570417
	The product produced by the method of claim 1.	0.0005879345606747642
	The court found that the invention was for a process, not a product, and therefore that the product claim was not infringed.	0.0005295284540397789
	One question presented in the case was whether claims such as claim 13 were infringed by the same product produced by a different method, or whether such claims were infringed only if the accused infringer used the process of claim 1.	0.0005040214740977054
	As noted earlier, this holding follows this court's clear statement in	0.00042767179530468893
	The issue here is only whether such a claim is infringed by products made by processes other than the one claimed.	0.0004233168548922596
	927 F.2d 1200 (Fed.Cir.1991), the district court considered the following claim:	0.00040742120638377063
	Each party shall bear its own costs.	0.00040241645058693387
	They are neither necessary nor technical.	0.00038970498152371733
	Claim 1 set forth the method referred to in claim 13, as follows:	0.00034293064561846746
	The Merrill Court explained that the issue was the "correct construction of plaintiff's patent," id. at 569, construing the following claim:	0.00027557063244715605
	The ï¿½ï¿½507 patent has five claims, all of which Abbott asserts against Lupin as well as Sandoz and Teva.	0.000245242871915892
	The patent will issue subject to the ordinary requirements of patentability.	0.00023646136802657266
	This court held that the claims were product claims.	0.0001908874796330047
	There was no issue in BASF of a product that could not be defined without reference to how it was made.	0.00018975753272503656
