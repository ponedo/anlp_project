	The SCH 31925 composition contained only the 5(S) and SSSSR stereoisomers of ramipril.	6.264912191407454
	Accordingly, SCH 31925-a mixture of 5(S) ramipril with its SSSSR stereoisomer-is part of the prior art.	4.074449262847158
	That is, a 30 milligram dose of a mixture that is ? 5(S) ramipril has the same effectiveness as a 10 milligram dose of pure 5(S) ramipril.	4.045174825801247
	Using this system, all five stereocenters in ramipril are in the "S" configuration, so it is known as an "SSSSS" or "5(S)" stereoisomer.	3.4681864973165886
	Enalapril has three stereocenters.	3.3725114463931902
	The close structural analogy between 5(S) and SSSSR ramipril and SSS and SSR enalapril would have led a person of ordinary skill to expect 5(S) and SSSSR ramipril to differ similarly in potency.	3.2216059425862857
	In February 1981, Dr. Smith synthesized a mixture of 5(S)-configuration ramipril and its SSSSR stereoisomer, which mixture came to be known as SCH 31925.	3.0785659908730385
	The following structural formula represents ramipril:	2.983514379599308
	Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers.	2.8077473297961935
	scientist did not abandon, suppress, or conceal chemical composition, and thus composition had to be considered as part of prior art, and claims of patent for pharmaceutical drug ramipril, which covered 5(S) stereoisomer of ramipril in composition substantially free of other isomers, were invalid over other composition of 5(S) ramipril with its SSSSR stereoisomer.	2.704997327066833
	Aventis is correct that, on the basis of the record, the RRSSS and 5(S) forms might have been expected to have comparable potencies; both of them have only S-configured stereocenters in the part of the ramipril molecule that is common to enalapril, as the R stereocenters in the RRSSS form are the "bridgehead" carbons.	2.4339683644266965
	The ï¿½ï¿½886 application, the ï¿½ï¿½258 patent, and the ï¿½ï¿½944 patent disclose the structure of ramipril but do not describe how its stereocenters should be configured.	2.432567335123397
	Rather, that carbon atom is in the part of the ramipril molecule that is common to the enalapril molecule.	2.3673736844102535
	The record suggests that when Dr. Smith synthesized SCH 31925, she understood that the 5(S) form of ramipril was the mixture's therapeutically active ingredient.	2.342644024805757
	Aventis's protestations notwithstanding, there is no evidence that separating 5(S) and SSSSR ramipril was outside the capability of an ordinarily skilled artisan.	2.3325060198434913
	When the R 2 functional group is ethyl, the compound of claim 1 is ramipril.	2.274494459624503
	In October 1981, Dr. Volker Teetz, an Aventis chemist, also synthesized ramipril.	2.2601257219884703
	We agree with the district court that Dr. Smith did not separate the 5(S) and SSSSR isomers, and there is no evidence that she conceived of a purified formulation containing only 5(S) ramipril.	2.1861357875253336
	The prior art supporting prima facie obviousness included the SCH 31925 mixture, and so Aventis must show that 5(S) ramipril had unexpected results not over all of its stereoisomers, but over that mixture, which did not contain the RRSSS form.	2.1451630391799177
	The hydrogen atom may also lie above the planes of the rings, resulting in a structure that is a stereoisomer of ramipril.	2.1311221863156486
	Because there are five carbon atoms that may take either of two orientations-or five "stereocenters," as such atoms are known-ramipril is one of 2 5, or 32, stereoisomers.	2.102024208091178
	Moreover, the ï¿½ï¿½944 patent specifically taught that stereoisomers of ramipril "can be separated by conventional chromatographic or fractional crystallization methods".	2.0554299870460233
	The title of Example 20 encompasses only eight of the 32 stereoisomers of ramipril, but there is some suggestion in the record that, in fact, Example 20 would have produced only four stereoisomers in practice.	2.0237720098187975
	In support, Aventis points to the district court's finding that 5(S) ramipril is 18 times as potent as the next most potent isomer, the RRSSS form.	1.990177997924548
	Whatever the answer to this question might be, it is undisputed that SCH 31925 and the other mixtures of ramipril isomers in the prior art are mixtures that are not substantially free of isomers other than the 5(S) form, whereas the claimed composition of 5(S) ramipril is ipso facto "substantially free" enough.	1.9538954757648033
	In both the 5(S) and SSSSR forms, the two "bridgehead" carbons are in the S configuration.	1.9176551385307157
	In sum, we hold that claims 1 and 2 of the ï¿½ï¿½722 patent, which cover the 5(S) stereoisomer of ramipril in a composition substantially free of other isomers, are invalid under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 103 over the SCH 31925 mixture, the ï¿½ï¿½ 944 patent, and the enalapril references in the prior art.	1.8768826479608938
	It is uncontested that these references were publicly disclosed or published well before the development of ramipril and that both Schering's and Aventis's efforts towards developing ramipril were based on this body of earlier knowledge.	1.7529042954497702
	Captopril retains two stereocenters from BPP5a, both of which remain in the S configuration.	1.720831086534521
	Other stereoisomers would include RRRRR, SSSSR, RRSSS, etc.	1.7157799759362848
	For purposes of this appeal, it is sufficient to observe that it is uncontested that Example 20 yields a mixture of several, but not all, stereoisomers of ramipril, one of which is the 5(S) form.	1.7134445326468493
	And the potency of pure 5(S) ramipril is precisely what one would expect, as compared to a mixture containing other, inert or near-inert stereoisomers.	1.692228916702076
	The addition of the second ring gives rise to two more stereocenters than are present in enalapril; thus, ramipril has the same three stereocenters as enalapril, plus two new ones that span the fused ring system and are therefore known as "bridgehead" carbons, for a total of five as discussed above.	1.6650589060302112
	On March 18, 2005, Lupin filed an ANDA seeking approval for a generic version of ramipril.	1.657546127379091
	In a published article, Merck scientists explained that the all-S (SSS) stereoisomer of enalapril was found to have 700 times the potency of the SSR stereoisomer.	1.6130641484916113
	Soon after enalapril's introduction, Dr. Elizabeth Smith, a chemist at Schering, conceived of the structure of ramipril and recorded it in her laboratory notebooks.	1.6101502152615454
	Aventis attempts to rebut this prima facie case of obviousness by arguing that purified 5(S) ramipril exhibited unexpected results in the form of increased potency.	1.5994632516696639
	Example 20 of the ï¿½ï¿½886 application discloses a method for making ramipril and is contained in the published specification of the ï¿½ï¿½944 patent.	1.557539740895662
	In enalapril, as in captopril and BPP5a before it, all of the stereocenters are in the S configuration; the Merck article taught that the SSS configuration of enalapril is 700 times as potent as the SSR form.	1.5451635398382717
	It appears likely that in some of these stereoisomers, the "bridgehead" carbons are in the R configuration.	1.5102475035456497
	The patent at issue in this appeal is directed to the pharmaceutical compound ramipril in a formulation "substantially free of other isomers".	1.5028742816556522
	The active compound isolated from viper venom, known as BPP5a, has six stereocenters, all of which are in the S configuration.	1.4977062986559402
	On January 28, 1991, the FDA granted approval, and Aventis began to sell ramipril under the name Altace THE-R.	1.489876763634082
	Least controversial are the various references regarding BPP5a, captopril, and enalapril.	1.3174990038370937
	Ramipril's immediate predecessor is an ACE inhibitor known as enalapril that was introduced by Merck in 1980.	1.3117775917684202
	In exchange, Aventis conceded priority as to the primary subject matter of the ï¿½ï¿½258 patent-the structure, production, and therapeutic use of ramipril, without specification of particular stereoisomers.	1.2870985772715517
	Ramipril, like many complex organic molecules, is one of a family of stereoisomers.	1.2822336260200962
	Finally, we rely, as did the district court, on Dr. Smith's synthesis of SCH 31925, which qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 102(g) as of a date no later than the end of March 1981, several months before Aventis's own synthesis of ramipril.	1.26678129673058
	Ramipril has the same overall structure as enalapril, with one distinction: where ramipril has two linked five-sided carbon rings (a "5,5 fused ring system"), depicted, in the chemical diagrams above, on the left side of the molecule, enalapril has only a single ring.	1.2503596233597676
	Aventis retained the right to prosecute its application as to the 5(S) stereoisomer of ramipril in formulations "substantially free of other isomers," which it contended (and still contends) represents a separately patentable invention.	1.2302872848932604
	Notably, all of the stereocenters in the most therapeutically active stereoisomers of these prior art compounds are in the S configuration, and this fact was taught by, among other references, Merck's enalapril article in Nature.	1.2245020511230242
	However, the district court found, and Aventis does not dispute on appeal, that SCH 31925-the product of the process as modified by Smith-contains exactly two isomers, the 5(S) and SSSSR forms, and was successfully produced by Dr. Smith.	1.2149045640285443
	The dispute about patent rights having been resolved between Schering and Aventis, Aventis proceeded to seek FDA approval of ramipril (apparently in a substantially pure 5(S) form).	1.1405864293819639
	A stereoisomer is an isomer in which the same atoms are bonded to the same other atoms, but where the configuration of those atoms in three dimensions differs.	1.1268810927506152
	The district court held that Lupin failed to meet its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to purify 5(S) ramipril into a composition substantially free of other isomers.	1.1062425675853824
¡°	This is a patent infringement action concerning the pharmaceutical compound ramipril, which is marketed by King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("King") as a blood pressure medication under the name Altace THE-R.	1.0402890707716517
	The key question is whether the 5(S) stereoisomer of ramipril, in a form substantially free of other isomers,4 would have been obvious over the prior art listed above to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the ï¿½ï¿½722 patent's priority date.	1.0254387295285008
	The record contains a litany of potential prior art references, only some of which are summarized in Part I.B above, and the prosecution histories of both the ï¿½ï¿½722 patent and Schering's ramipril patents are complex.	1.018954649732693

	In light of the teachings of Example 20, Dr. Smith's written laboratory notebooks, and the test results that Dr. Smith obtained within weeks of SCH 31925's synthesis, we see no clear error in the district court's findings that Dr. Smith had conceived of the various stereoisomers and appreciated which of them SCH 31925 contained.	0.9739721027751

	The district court declined to grant summary judgment to either party as to literal infringement, finding disputed issues of material fact as to whether Lupin's formulation of ramipril was "substantially free of other isomers".	0.7820776271405776

	However, if it is known that some desirable property of a mixture derives in whole or in part from a particular one of its components, or if the prior art would provide a person of ordinary skill in the art with reason to believe that this is so, the purified compound is prima facie obvious over the mixture even without an explicit teaching that the ingredient should be concentrated or purified.	0.07023341436801854

	The ï¿½ï¿½944 patent, it observes, is a continuation-in-part of Schering's U.S. Patent Application No. 06/258,484 ("the ï¿½ï¿½484 application"), itself a continuation-in-part of the ï¿½ï¿½886 application.	0.06278469998526262

	Thereafter, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") granted Schering Patent No. 4,587,258 ("the ï¿½ï¿½258 patent," issued May 6, 1986) and No. 5,348,944 ("the ï¿½ï¿½944 patent," issued Sept. 20, 1994), both claiming priority from the ï¿½ï¿½886 application via a series of continuations and continuations-in-part.	0.039727243471528915
	Aventis also challenges the prior art status of the ï¿½ï¿½258 patent on the ground that it is a continuation-in-part containing previously undisclosed new matter.	0.0355481111691334
	There has been no showing either that Smith "intentionally suppressed or concealed her invention" or that an "inference of suppression or concealment can be drawn based on an unreasonable delay in making the invention publicly known".	0.03529084613061982

	A very similar method to the one Dr. Smith used had already been disclosed in the ï¿½ï¿½886 patent application, the exact method was subsequently disclosed in the ï¿½ï¿½258 patent, and the composition was developed in the course of extensive ongoing research and development and concurrent ongoing patent prosecution.	0.02763836352264594

	The "reason or motivation" need not be an explicit teaching that the claimed compound will have a particular utility; it is sufficient to show that the claimed and prior art compounds possess a "sufficiently close relationship ... to create an expectation," in light of the totality of the prior art, that the new compound will have "similar properties" to the old.	0.010917897257316522

	Such a composition is precisely the subject matter of claim 2 of the ï¿½ï¿½722 patent, but the question is dispositive of the obviousness of claim 1 as well, because claim 1 is to a broader genus containing the same subject matter.	0.007019907868109133
