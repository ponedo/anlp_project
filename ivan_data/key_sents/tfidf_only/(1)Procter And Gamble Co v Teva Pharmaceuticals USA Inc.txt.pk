	In this case, P & G synthesized and tested 2-pyr EHDP, risedronate (3-pyr EHDP) and 4-pyr EHDP, another structural isomer.	6.303497529744075
	Teva contends that the structural similarities between risedronate and 2-pyr EHDP render the challenged claims of the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent obvious.	4.667221642833947
	In this case, risedronate and 2-pyr EHDP are positional isomers; they each contain the same atoms arranged in different ways.	4.0075621131352595
	In another test involving live animals, 2-pyr EHDP was lethal at a dose of 1.0 mg P/kg/day while risedronate was not.	3.559334743334238
	In a test to determine the lowest dose at which these compounds caused toxic reactions, risedronate outperformed 2-pyr EHDP by a substantial margin.	3.475308565816925
	Teva argues that the ï¿½ï¿½406 patent identifies 2-pyr EHDP as the most promising molecule for the inhibition of bone resorption.	3.4359952814417434
	However, because the competing drug alendronate was available before risedronate, Teva contends that risedronate could not have satisfied any unmet need.	3.393665914844337
	In risedronate, the hydroxy-ethanediphosphonate group is connected to the # 3 carbon of a pyridine ring, while in 2-pyr EHDP, the hydroxy-ethane-diphosphonate group is connected to the # 2 carbon.	3.2787012414022776
	We need not reach this question because we conclude that even if 2-pyr EHDP was a lead compound, the evidence does not establish that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill at the time of the invention to modify 2-pyr EHDP to create risedronate.	3.1870655362711755
	Eventually, researchers at P & G identified risedronate as a promising drug candidate.	3.1864876706011236
	Specifically, P & G alleged that Teva's proposed drug infringed claim 4 of the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent for the compound risedronate, claim 16 for pharmaceutical compositions containing risedronate, and claim 23 for methods of treating diseases using risedronate.	3.0778092303791023
	Dr. Miller stated that the superior properties of risedronate were unexpected and could not have been predicted.	2.852361400174328
	On December 6, 1985, risedronate's inventors applied for a patent on the compound.	2.840485753983315
	The district court concluded that, even if 2-pyr EHDP were a lead compound, it would not render the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent's claims on risedronate obvious because a person having ordinary skill in the art would not have had reason to make risedronate based on the prior art.	2.7357255094092583
	For example, Dr. Benedict testified that he and other researchers did not predict the potency of risedronate.	2.52124671172493
¡°	The ï¿½ï¿½122 patent claims the compound risedronate, the active ingredient of P & G's osteoporosis drug Actonel THE-R.	2.4249334811375713
	The district court found that the appellee's expert was evasive on this topic, stating that the witness "did not directly respond to most questions posed to him about whether it would be common for a chemist who develops a pyridine compound to conceive of and make [2-pyr EHDP, 3-pyr EHDP, and 4-pyr EHDP] isomers".	2.390089110910401
	Ms. McOsker testified that she was "very surprised" by the low dose at which risedronate was effective.	2.335365457360434
	As an alternative to its position that risedronate was not obvious, P & G argues that the ï¿½ï¿½406 patent should not be considered prior art with respect to the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent because risedronate was first synthesized by P & G before the ï¿½ï¿½406 patent was filed.	2.3273360499603704
	Nonetheless, we note that P & G's witnesses consistently testified that the properties of risedronate were not expected.	2.2907106823854555
	patent claiming risedronate was not invalid based on obviousness-type double patenting.	2.2485637235152915
	The ï¿½ï¿½ 406 patent lists thirty-six polyphosphonate molecules as treatment candidates and eight preferred compounds for intermittent dosing, including 2-pyr EHDP.	2.0955496463295145
	Risedronate showed no observable toxic effect at a dose of 0.75 mg P/kg/day, while 2-pyr EHDP's "no observable effect level" was only 0.25 mg P/kg/day.	2.0549132840834816
	Here, the district court's findings indicate that there was no reasonable expectation in 1985 that risedronate would be a successful compound.	1.9941376228371517
	The trial court disagreed and concluded from the evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have identified 2-pyr EHDP as a lead compound for the treatment of osteoporosis.	1.9386690786909686
	The court rightly gave little weight to risedronate's commercial success because the prior art ï¿½ï¿½406 patent was also assigned to P & G. As of December 6, 1985, the filing date of the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent, 2-pyr EHDP could be found only in a pending application for the ï¿½ï¿½406 patent, which was not available to the public.	1.8828866252078367
	In August 2004, P & G sued Teva for infringement of the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent after Teva notified P & G that it planned to market risedronate as a generic equivalent of Actonel THE-R.	1.8723032218625595
	The district court concluded that unexpected results of risedronate's potency and toxicity rebut a claim of obviousness.	1.8318990548650176
	Appellant's expert testified that "if someone was aware that [2-pyr EHDP] was safe and effective, they would immediately in terms of the drug discovery effort, make the [3-pyr EHDP]."	1.8318984298140972
	At trial, Dr. Benedict, one of the inventors named in the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent, testified that he synthesized risedronate in May 1985.	1.816687322858443
	The district court's findings also support the conclusion that there could have been no reasonable expectation as to risedronate's success.	1.802098635735463
	From the testimony at trial, the district court concluded that the ï¿½ï¿½ 406 patent would not have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to identify 2-pyr EHDP as the lead compound.	1.7563902012714756
	The district court found that risedronate, marketed as Actonel, has been an undisputed commercial success and satisfied a long-felt unmet	1.7450604285951603
	Owner of patent claiming compound risedronate, the active ingredient of an osteoporosis drug, brought infringement action against competitor.	1.6387149504260565
	This conclusion was based on the testimony of Dr. Daniel C. Smith, who stated that risedronate experienced favorable growth and had amassed $2.7 billion in aggregate domestic sales.	1.5989474603143128
	Having concluded that risedronate was not obvious under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 103, we similarly conclude that the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent is not invalid for obviousness-type double patenting.	1.55675543459023
	P & G submitted a portion of Dr. Benedict's laboratory notebook which contains a May 3, 1985 entry detailing the structure of risedronate and the procedure for its synthesis, but this entry was unwitnessed and was not corroborated by any other evidence.	1.5412494826870615
	Additionally, there was an insufficient showing that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had a "reasonable expectation of success" in synthesizing and testing risedronate.	1.4756347785823405
	The first two promising bisphosphonates studied for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases, etidronate (EHDP) and clodronate, had clinical problems which prevented their commercialization.	1.4673895687969565
	To decide whether risedronate was obvious in light of the prior art, a court must determine whether, at the time of invention, a person having ordinary skill in the art would have had "reason to attempt to make the composition" known as risedronate and "a reasonable expectation of success in doing so".	1.4665040453358495
	Confirming the unpredictability of bisphosphonates, test results for 4-pyr EHDP revealed that it was not active in inhibiting bone resorption despite its close relationship with potent compounds.	1.4097083250677884
	The district court found that Teva failed to clear that hurdle, establishing insufficient motivation for a person of ordinary skill to synthesize and test risedronate.	1.3539018025620704
	Because P & G did not provide adequate corroborating evidence of an earlier invention date for risedronate, the district court correctly concluded that the ï¿½ï¿½406 patent qualifies as prior art for purposes of this inquiry.	1.3454180890442984
	district court did not commit clear error in concluding that secondary considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness of patent claiming risedronate;	1.3186521562584852
	Accordingly, it was not clear error for the district court to conclude that risedronate met such a need and that secondary considerations supported a finding of non-obviousness.	1.236169135111239
	Comparing the claims of the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent to those of the ï¿½ï¿½406 patent, we note that, while claims 4 and 16 of the ï¿½ï¿½122 patent explicitly claim the risedronate compound, the ï¿½ï¿½406 patent claims an intermittent dosing regimen for the treatment of osteoporosis and claims no new compounds.	1.0180612303784735
	Bisphosphonates, in general, are active in inhibiting bone resorption.	0.995593101582593
	In light of the extremely unpredictable nature of bisphosphonates at the time of the invention, the district court also found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have been motivated to make the specific molecular modifications to make risedronate.	0.9925178493986534

	Dr. Fleisch wrote in 1984 that "every compound, while remaining a bisphosphonate, exhibits its own physical-chemical, biological and therapeutic characteristics, so that each bisphosphonate has to be considered on its own.

	Additionally, the trial court relied on contemporaneous writings from Herbert Fleisch, the preeminent authority on bisphosphonates during the relevant time period.	0.36486784243313247
	As the trial court noted, the ï¿½ï¿½406 patent "addresses the central problem seen in bisphosphonates at the time, namely that they inhibited bone mineralization, by teaching the use of a cyclic administrative regimen to achieve a separation of the benign effect of anti-resorption from the unwanted side effect of anti-mineralization in patients".	0.32724627972786907
