	For its R, R1, and R3 positions, lacosamide has an unsubstituted benzyl at R, an unsubstituted methyl at R1, and a nonaromatic methoxymethyl at R3.	12.069916957590685
	Compound 3l had unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1 with methoxyamino at R3.	11.002188301782793
	AAB contained a benzyl at R, and a methyl at R1.	10.913825793719761
	For its R positions, lacosamide has an unsubstituted benzyl at R, an unsubstituted methyl at R1, and a nonaromatic methoxymethyl group at R3.2	10.032098451186357
	Once again, the "starting point" was benzyl at R and methyl at R1.	9.895118654150016
	The definition of R includes unsubstituted benzyl and the definition of R1 includes unsubstituted methyl.	9.458961281603367
	id. at 503, unsubstituted benzyl at R, and unsubstituted methyl at R1, id. at 530.	9.458565373049982
	Similar to lacosamide, LeGall replaced the R3 position in compound 107e with a nonaromatic methoxymethyl group.	9.008143888508519
	Relevant to the issues here, the compounds studied in Kohn 1987 used an unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1.	8.638498642846418
	The paper used unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1 as a "reference point," and considered five possible modifications of the unsubstituted benzyl at R and three modifications of the unsubstituted methyl at R1.	8.609100316183008
	None of the compounds listed in Table 1 are lacosamide, compound 107e disclosed in LeGall, or any FAA compound with a methoxymethyl group at R3.	7.201218567343885
	In reality, "there were many tests conducted on FAAs with benzyl at R and methyl at R1".	6.986679337636479
	All twenty-six compounds reported in that paper had unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1 with different compounds at the R3 group.	6.8196230329883445
	He reported that the most potent compound was 2g, which had benzyl at R and methyl at R1.	6.7107214812292195
	And most of the FAAs studied prior to the priority date only experimented with modifying the substituents at the R3 position while holding constant the unsubstituted benzyls at R and unsubstituted methyls at R1.	6.508269335873288
	And indeed, as the district court found, 75% of Dr. Kohn's experimental compounds contained benzyl at R and methyl at R1, and most of these were unsubstituted.	6.443430575337825
	As the district court found here, there was no indication that out of the millions of possible choices, an unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1 would have been selected in combination with a methoxymethyl group at R3 to arrive at lacosamide.	6.299052049620852
	Claim 45 does not recite the molecules at R and R1, however.	6.072783555015328
	Lacosamide has a methoxymethyl group at R3,	6.04300333394499
	Relevant here, LeGall disclosed compound 107e.	5.767878684107125
	Relying on, among other things, the lack of supporting efficacy data investigating the impact of placing an unsubstituted benzyl and methyl at R and R1, the district court concluded that it would not have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to make lacosamide by placing an unsubstituted benzyl at R or an unsubstituted methyl at R1 in combination with methoxymethyl at R3.	5.61899613727601
	Indeed, Dr. Kohn described unsubstituted benzyl for R and an unsubstituted methyl for R1 as the "starting point" or "reference point" for nearly every experiment he published.	5.577030068816718
	Asserted claim 9 claims lacosamide.	5.401226393072172
	Compound 107e is the racemate of the lacosamide compound claimed in the '551 patent, meaning that instead of the isolated R-enantiomer (lacosamide) claimed in the '551 patent, compound 107e is a mixture of both the R and S enantiomers.	5.395408789020153
	The district court found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation of success in selecting an unsubstituted benzyl for R and an unsubstituted methyl for R1.	5.270151758409155
	Focusing on these differences, the district court found that as of the priority date, a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation that placing an unsubstituted benzyl at R or an unsubstituted methyl at R1 with a methoxymethyl group at R3 would have yielded an efficacious anticonvulsant FAA.	5.154073103717772
	In Dr. Kohn's 1990 paper, he also kept "R1 constant and R constant" as methyl and benzyl, respectively.	4.9632151198855174
	Notably, like lacosamide, compound 3l contained a nonaromatic group at R3.	4.928602880817447
	LeGall discloses and provides anticonvulsant efficacy data for all 15 compounds except for compound 107e.	4.912280711990996
	LeGall focused on 15 new FAAs and their potential anticonvulsant activities.	4.892643028566414
	Claim 45, which depends from claim 44, recites that R3 is a methoxymethyl group, which is the substituent at R3 in lacosamide and claimed in the '551 patent.	4.881385400405655
	Unlike lacosamide, 2g had an aromatic 2-furanyl structure at R3.	4.843975694410496
	In other words, claim 9 "selects substituents for R (benzyl) and R1 (methyl) that fall within the scope of claims 44/45".	4.722894816622771
	All of the compounds listed in Table 1 of the '729 patent have a methyl at R1 and 49 of them have an unsubstituted benzyl at R, all with varying potency, ranging from 3.3 mg/kg to over 300 mg/kg.	4.720133600451976
	Finally, Appellants asserted that the '551 patent was anticipated by LeGall's disclosure of the racemic mixture of compound 107e, which necessarily discloses the enantiomers of that mixture, including the R enantiomer (lacosamide).	4.518391866775443
	That portion of Dr. Roush's testimony explained that because R and R1 were held constant in the compounds studied in LeGall, one could not tell what role benzyl and methyl had in the activity of the compounds disclosed.	4.403502415005699
	The development of FAAs as anticonvulsants began in the 1980s with the inventor of the '551 patent, Dr. Kohn.	4.355168023085744
	On this record it is clear that Dr. Kohn's extensive study of FAAs provides copious amounts of information from which a person of ordinary skill would form a reasonable expectation that the selection of an unsubstituted benzyl for R and an unsubstituted methyl for R1 would lead to the successful creation of an FAA with anticonvulsant activity.	4.327398093884773
	In 1985, Dr. Kohn published the anticonvulsant activity of his first FAA compound, AAB.	4.321553584336965
	Unlike lacosamide, none of the most potent compounds in Table 1 had a nonaromatic group at R3.	4.256645263460604
	Because these claims only have a common methoxymethyl group at the R3 position, the question before us is whether a person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with claim 45 of the '301 patent, would have been motivated to place an unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1 in combination with the methoxymethyl group at R3 with a reasonable expectation of success.	4.226512863761877
	Despite not disclosing any pharmacological data for compound 107e, LeGall speculated that because of its structural similarities to compound 86b in the study, which had an ED50 of 62, compound 107e "may have good anticonvulsant activity".	4.2186695177176725
	In this study, Dr. Kohn also kept the R and R1 positions constant as benzyl and methyl, respectively, while testing the effect of different substituents at the R3 position.	4.187640926933773
	As the district court found, by the priority date, there was little to no data from which a person of ordinary skill in the art could have formed reasonable expectations about the effect of placing an unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1 in combination with a methoxymethyl group at R3.	4.185534197445922
	By comparison, LeGall reported that other proven anticonvulsants had ED50 values of 14.0, 18.7, 20.1, and 61.0 mg/kg, and some other FAAs had ED50 values of 51.0 and 62.0 mg/kg.	4.115987462075197
	As I detail below, the district court's findings of fact as to the prior art provided ample evidence showing that a person of skill in the art would have had a reasonable expectation of success in creating an FAA with anticonvulsant activity by selecting an unsubstituted benzyl for R and an unsubstituted methyl for R1.	4.102151436758756
	Out of all the work performed by Dr. Kohn and others, not a single reference disclosed any anticonvulsant data for any compound comprising a methoxymethyl group at R3 let alone lacosamide.	4.048761380652477
	As disclosed in the '551 patent, lacosamide is the R-enantiomer of N-benzyl-2-acetamido-3-methoxypropion-amide.	4.021684833223411
	To the extent, however, the district court found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation of success in selecting an unsubstituted benzyl for R and an unsubstituted methyl for R1, it clearly erred.	3.9529601075657532
	Important to the issues here, the '729 patent teaches that "the preferred values of R is aryl lower alkyl, especially benzyl" and "the most preferred R1 group is methyl".	3.9342200888693144
	Kohn's compound 3l is also a nonaromatic compound like compound 107e, and Dr. Roush testified that nonaromatic compounds were not of interest as of 1996.	3.791038177904312
	(1) unlike claim 45 of the '301 patent, claim 9 of the '551 patent requires the R-enantiomer with 90% or greater purity; (2) while claim 45 of the '301 patent allows for any substituted or unsubstituted "aryl, aryl lower alkyl, heterocyclic, heterocyclic lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, or lower cycloalkyl lower alkyl," at R, the '551 patent requires an unsubstituted benzyl at R; and (3) while claim 45 of the '301 patent allows R1 to be a substituted or unsubstituted hydrogen or lower alkyl with at least one electron withdrawing or donating group, the '551 patent requires R1 to be an unsubstituted methyl.	3.7755159339282365
	The district court, relying on LeGall and crediting expert testimony, made extensive fact findings regarding the LeGall Thesis.	3.7483980768608136
	Independent claim 39 permits a large number of groups at R, R1, and R3, where each group can comprise a large number of substituents and can be either unsubstituted or substituted.	3.713256576969023
	Claim 9 recites the lacosamide compound with 90% or greater purity.	3.6956008769719553
	R1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl and R1 is unsubstituted or substituted with at least one electron withdrawing group or at least one electron donating group;	3.6738339757421734
	They argue that because LeGall discloses the chemical structure of the racemic compound 107e, it necessarily discloses the R-enantiomer (lacosamide) recited in claim 9 of the '551 patent.	3.662109552325072
	LeGall concluded that the most active compounds studied had heteroaromatic groups in the R3 position whereas compound 107e had a nonaromatic group.	3.639044546420782
	In this case, both claims recite a methoxymethyl group at R3.	3.6027091510819824
	In this formula, R, R1, and R3 are variables, meaning that different elements or compounds can be placed at each of these three sites.	3.581257954933598
	The district court explained that LeGall's reference to compound 107e lacks any data or discussion that would have motivated a person of ordinary skill in the art to use a nonaromatic compound such as a methoxymethyl at R3.	3.5669292611789505
	Appellants assert that claim 9 of the '551 patent would have been obvious based on LeGall's disclosure of compound 107e as a racemic mixture.	3.558273032820243
	Dr. Kohn himself explained in his 1991 paper (where all 26 compounds reported had unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1) that "you get potent protection if you have a benzyl on one end [at R] and a methyl on the other [at R1]."1Id. at 506. The district court recognized that "there were many tests conducted on FAAs with benzyl at R and methyl at R1". Id. at 531. But it dismissed the resulting data because "most of these tests kept the structures at R and R1 constant in order to assess changes made at the R3 position" and so "any changes (whether increases or decreases) observed in anticonvulsant behavior and/or neurotoxicity would be attributed to the structure at R3 rather than to the benzyl at R or the methyl at R1". Id. In dismissing the data resulting from these tests, the court clearly erred. Although the experiments may have been designed to assess changes made at the R3 position, by using unsubstituted benzyl for R and an unsubstituted methyl for R1 as the "starting point" or "reference point" for these tests, the prior art showed, without question, that those substituents would work at those positions. And not only did the prior art show that unsubstituted benzyl works at R and that unsubstituted methyl works at R1, the prior art showed that FAAs with these substituents so positioned demonstrate anticonvulsant activity. It was clear error for the district court to require testing to provide "insight into the effectiveness of benzyl and methyl relative to other structures that could be placed at R and R1". Id. Where the prior art teaches that the selected substituent will work, even when it is selected from thousands of compounds, an inability to predict how any one substituent will work in the composition and a need for testing will not render that selection nonobvious. See In re Corkill, 771 F.2d 1496, 1500	3.539467641833527
	Thus, the double patenting analysis requires determining whether the claims' differences, i.e., unsubstituted benzyl and methyl at R and R1, would have been obvious to one of skill in the art.	3.5142689699806127
	Compound 3l contained a methoxyamino group at R3 and exhibited superior anticonvulsant properties.	3.5103452839483693
	As the district court found, LeGall discloses no data whatsoever for compound 107e or any compound with a methoxymethyl group at the R3 position.	3.440887627344124
	The R, R1, and R3 positions are variables, representing the many different chemical groups that can be placed at each position resulting in a vast number of possible FAA compounds.	3.2860105971102103
	When claim 45 is limited to depending from claim 44, the R3 group is defined as methoxymethyl.	3.1524422855660807
	Specifically, UCB argued that the court should consider whether the commonly shared R3 methoxymethyl group in the '301 and '551 patents would have been substituted with another substituent when considering which substituents to place at the R and R1 positions.	3.1382161518676632
	Dr. Roush also testified that based on LeGall's disclosure, a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have been motivated to develop compound 107e.	3.1132246113443727
	The district court buttressed its finding with the data disclosed in the '729 patent showing that compounds with benzyl and methyl at R and R1 with different R3 groups had a varying range of effectiveness.	3.1101337725230835
	Although lacosamide is not specifically disclosed in the '301 patent, it is undisputed that lacosamide falls within the broad genus of claim 39 of the '301 patent.	3.1019083075014735
	Kohn 1987 showed that the placement of an aromatic group at the R3 position showed improved anticonvulsant activity.	3.090456818016319
	Because I believe that the district court clearly erred when it found there would not have been a reasonable expectation of success in selecting unsubstituted benzyl for R and unsubstituted methyl for R1, I disagree with the majority that the asserted claims of the '551 patent are patentably distinct from the reference patent claims.	3.0694426728973747
	(Fed. Cir. 1985) ("Although [the inventor] declared that it cannot be predicted how any candidate will work in a detergent composition, but that it must be tested, this does not overcome [the prior art's] teaching that hydrated zeolites will work".); Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364. Further, if, as the district court found, all the testing focused on R3 and a person of ordinary skill would attribute anticonvulsant behavior to R3, once R3 was fixed in the '301 reference patent genus, plugging in unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1 (which had remained largely constant throughout the prior art testing) would be viewed simply as a trivial selection. Indeed, because the '301 claim is a genus claim, with only two variables R and R1, a person of ordinary skill would know to select a substituent for each variable. A person of ordinary skill would certainly have a reasonable expectation of success when deciding which substituents to select if she copied the "75% of Dr. Kohn's compounds [which] contained benzyl at R and methyl at R1, and most of these were unsubstituted". District Court Opinion, 201 F.Supp.3d at 531. In dismissing the data resulting from the many tests conducted with unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1 and in relying so heavily on what it saw as a lack of data, the district court clearly erred. The district court also erred when it found that the limited data that did exist at the time would not have led a person of ordinary skill to place an unsubstituted benzyl at R or an unsubstituted methyl at R1. Id. at 532. Indeed, the data that were available showed that unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1 were comparable to, if not better than, any other substituents tested. For example, Dr. Kohn, in his 1985 paper, used unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1 as a "reference point," and considered five possible modifications of the unsubstituted benzyl at R and three modifications of the unsubstituted methyl at R1. Id. at 506. With respect to the R position, only one of the five R modifications showed activity comparable to unsubstituted benzyl at R. Id. The others showed decreased activity. Id. For the R1 position, each of the three modifications decreased anticonvulsant activity when compared to unsubstituted methyl. Id. Dr. Kohn also considered, in his 1990 paper, the effect of replacing an unsubstituted benzyl at R and found that placing a fluoro-substituted benzyl at R yielded only a comparable anticonvulsant effect. Id. Fluoro-substituted benzyl at R did, however, provide a "far superior" protective index. Id. Yet, this must be balanced against Dr. Kohn's 1991 paper (where all 26 compounds reported had unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1) explaining that "you get potent protection if you have a benzyl on one end [at R] and a methyl on the other [at R1]." Id. (emphasis added). Thus, the data that were available showed that unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1 were comparable, if not better, than any other substituents that were tested with respect to anticonvulsant activity. Despite the test that demonstrated fluoro-substituted benzyl's "far superior" protective index, these tests provide strong evidence that a person of ordinary skill would have a reasonable expectation of success in selecting these substituents in order to create an FAA having an anticonvulsant effect. This is especially so with respect to selecting unsubstituted methyl for R1 as it was the most successful substituent tested. Although these data might have shown that there was no guarantee that unsubstituted benzyl at R would provide the greatest protective index as compared to other possible substituents, "only a reasonable expectation of success, not a guarantee, is needed". Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364. Accordingly, the district court clearly erred when it found that the data specific to R and R1 that did exist at the time would not have led a person of ordinary skill to place an unsubstituted benzyl at R or an unsubstituted methyl at R1. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the district court erred when it did not consider the LeGall Thesis in its primary double-patenting analysis.2See District Court Opinion, 201 F.Supp.3d at 530-35. For purposes of this litigation, the parties agree that the LeGall Thesis constitutes a "printed publication" within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 102(b).3Id. at 508. Importantly, the LeGall Thesis disclosed compound 107e which, exactly like lacosamide, has a methoxymethyl group at R3, an unsubstituted benzyl at R, and an unsubstituted methyl at R1. Id. Compound 107e is identical to lacosamide except that it contains both the R- and S-enantiomers in a mixture, rather than just the R-enantiomer. Id. Although he did not have data for compound 107e, LeGall hypothesized that structural similarities between compound 107e and another compound for which he did have data, 86b, suggested that compound 107e "may have good anticonvulsant activity". Id. at 509. The LeGall Thesis is highly relevant to the obviousness analysis. For example, the majority concluded that "the trial evidence supports the district court's finding that there was no prior art that would have provided a person of ordinary skill reason to believe that unsubstituted benzyl and methyl would have been successful with a methoxymethyl group". Majority Op. 1326. Not so. The thesis disclosed a compound having, like lacosamide, a methoxymethyl group at R3 together with an unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1 and it provided a reasonable hypothesis, based on structural similarities to other compounds, that this compound "may have good anticonvulsant activity". District Court Opinion, 201 F.Supp.3d at 509. Again, "only a reasonable expectation of success, not a guarantee, is needed". Pfizer, 480 F.3d at 1364. Thus, to the extent the district court found that there was no indication in the prior art that benzyl and methyl would have been successful with a methoxymethyl group, it clearly erred. Certainly this evidence, especially when considered along with the other evidence before the district court, would have strongly contributed to a person of ordinary skill in the art's having a reasonable expectation of success in creating an FAA with anticonvulsant activity by selecting an unsubstituted benzyl for R and an unsubstituted methyl for R1. Considering all of the evidence, despite some supporting evidence identified by the district court, I am "left with the definite and firm conviction" that the district court made a mistake. Id. at 1359 (quoting U.S. Gypsum, 333 U.S. at 395, 68 S.Ct. 525). Thus, I conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that one skilled in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation of success with unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1. Taking the district court's clear error together with the remainder of its fact findings, I would have concluded that claims 9, 10, and 13 of the asserted '551 patent are not patentably distinct from the reference claims. Thus, I would reverse the district court's conclusion and hold that the asserted claims of the '551 patent are invalid for obviousness-type double patenting. I therefore respectfully dissent. All Citations 890 F.3d 1313, 127 U.S.P.Q.2d 1010 Footnotes Anticonvulsant activity, i.e., efficacy, is determined based on ED50, which in LeGall represents the dose at which half of the animals tested did not have a convulsion. A lower ED50 value represents higher potency. Conversely, a higher ED50 value represents lower potency. As shown in the formula of claim 1, the '551 patent uses "Ar", "Q", and "Q1" to designate the location of substituent groups corresponding to the "R", "R1", and "R3" positions in the asserted art. For ease of comparison, we use the R, R1, and R3 designations in discussing corresponding substituents in lacosamide. We note that the USPTO instituted an ex parte reexamination and inter partes review of the '551 patent. While this appeal was pending, the USPTO issued its final written decision in the inter partes review, concluding that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that claims 1-13 of the '551 patent would have been obvious over certain prior art, including Kohn 1991 and the '729 patent. See Argentum Pharm. LLC v. Research Corp. Techs., Inc., IPR2016-00204, 2017 WL 1096590 (PTAB Mar. 22, 2017). The USPTO also recently concluded its reexamination proceeding and confirmed that claims 9, 10, and 13 are not unpatentable for obviousness-type double patenting over the '301 patent, Kohn 1991, and the '729 patent. The dissent contends that the USPTO did not consider the LeGall Thesis in its reexamination. Dissent Op. 1335 n.3. We note, however, that the USPTO did consider LeGall and determined that LeGall was not prior art because it was not publically accessible before the priority date. See Argentum Pharm., IPR2016-00204, Paper No. 19 at 12 (PTAB May 23, 2016); District Court Opinion, 201 F.3d at 523. Additionally, I find it significant that unsubstituted benzyl and unsubstituted methyl were most often used together at R and R1, respectively. In other words, they are presented throughout the prior art as a pair. Thus, a person of ordinary skill would not need to independently select benzyl for R and then separately select methyl for R1, as the district court posited. The majority takes issue with my characterization of the district court's opinion on this point. I do not mean to imply that the district court did not make any findings of fact as to the LeGall Thesis. The court certainly did in its introductory "Findings of Fact" section. District Court Opinion, 201 F.Supp.3d at 508-09. But I maintain that the district court determined in its primary double-patenting analysis that there was no reasonable expectation of success without considering the teachings of this reference. A citation to two pages of Dr. Roush's trial testimony, stripped of any reference to the LeGall Thesis, cannot cure this deficiency. The majority, in support of its conclusion, notes that the USPTO instituted an ex parte reexamination of the '551 patent and concluded that claims 9, 10, and 13 were not unpatentable for obviousness-type double patenting over the '301 patent, Kohn 1991, and the '729 patent. Crucially, however, the USPTO did not institute trial as to grounds relying on the LeGall Thesis.	3.040025577565429
	The '551 patent discloses and claims lacosamide, the active ingredient in Vimpat THE-R.	3.019524468963988
	Dr. Roush testified, however, that a person of ordinary skill in the art looking to LeGall would have had no interest in pursuing that compound and that a person of ordinary skill would not have had a reasonable likelihood of success in pursuing an FAA with a methoxymethyl group at R3 as an anticonvulsant drug.	3.014296780716409
	In 1990, this was confirmed by Dr. Kohn in a study ("Kohn 1990") in which he concluded "that the anticonvulsant activity [of AAB and APB] resided primarily in the R stereoisomers".	3.0010726225361344
	Thus, far from ignoring LeGall, as the dissent suggests, the district court squarely considered and addressed LeGall in its double patenting analysis.	3.000595629498894
	The district court acknowledged that LeGall speculated that compound 107e "may" have good anticonvulsant activity based on its structural similarity to another compound.	2.8991182473135817
	Thus, the district court reasonably found that the prior art data studying FAAs did not provide sufficient insight into the effectiveness of placing benzyl and methyl at those positions relative to other substituents that could have been placed at the R and R1 positions.	2.889743813086851
	According to Dr. Kohn, AAB demonstrated the "proof of concept" for FAAs.	2.799253141010712
	Appellants also asserted that LeGall's disclosure of the racemic mixture compound 107e alone, or in combination with the '729 patent's disclosure of the genus of FAAs and Kohn 1991's disclosure of compound 3l rendered the asserted claims of the '551 patent obvious.	2.793969802350063
	Although LeGall discloses the chemical structure of the racemic compound 107e, it does not disclose its separation into individual enantiomers nor does it disclose any pharmaceutical data of the R enantiomer recited in claim 9 of the '551 patent.	2.7548174869677755
	Two years later, Dr. Kohn reported on the anticonvulsant activity of sixteen structural analogues of AAB.	2.6990796963814887
	As stated above, claim 45 depends from claim 39, which recites a genus of groups that can be located at R and R1.	2.635239675073923
	These groups may be aromatic, heteroaromatic, or nonaromatic.	2.6351663940452226
	Appellants further assert that LeGall alone, or in combination with the '729 patent and Kohn 1991, render claim 9 obvious.	2.604665512074553
	Relying principally on our decision in Sanofi, 550 F.3d at 1084, the district court found claim 9 of the '551 patent not anticipated, concluding that LeGall discloses neither the R-enantiomer of compound 107e nor any of its characteristics.	2.604085118986681
	In 1985, Dr. Kohn first disclosed the anticonvulsant activity of a compound identified as "AAB," which provided the proof of concept for the use of FAAs as anti-epileptic drugs.	2.5255568863925673
	This data showed that the R enantiomers of AAB and APB were 10 times more potent than their S enantiomers.	2.4682704945741536
	A compound in the R configuration having the formula:	2.453058157033922
	Thus, the trial evidence supports the district court's finding that there was no prior art that would have provided a person of ordinary skill reason to believe that unsubstituted benzyl and methyl would have been successful with a methoxymethyl group.	2.4404718099250817
	Ar is phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted with at least one halo group;	2.4402356607674105
	The asserted '551 patent discloses and claims lacosamide, a species of the genus disclosed in the '729 and '301 patents.	2.439983106763883
	In addition to Dr. Kohn's own publications, his research was disclosed in a 1987 thesis completed by his graduate student, Philippe LeGall ("LeGall").	2.392742738510741
¡°	The '551 patent covers lacosamide, an anti-epileptic drug, which treats epilepsy and other central nervous system disorders.	2.3066814362324197
	R is aryl, aryl lower alkyl, heterocyclic, heterocyclic lower alkyl, cycloalkyl or lower cycloalkyl lower alkyl, wherein R is unsubstituted or is substituted with at least one electron withdrawing group or an electron donating group;	2.296370521250495
	Owner of patent disclosing and claiming lacosamide brought infringement action against generic drug manufacturers, alleging that proposed generic lacosamide products would infringe patent.	2.2910703296541635
	Moreover, in its analysis under UCB's proffered alternative double patenting test, the district court rejected Appellants' argument that the claims of the '551 patent are indistinguishable from the discussion of compound 107e in LeGall.	2.2681490028759326
	Also, prior to the '551 patent, there was no public disclosure of pharmacological efficacy or safety data to support the use of any FAA as an anti-epileptic or anticonvulsant drug.	2.2455630093521397
	This finding was supported by Dr. Roush, who explained that the prior art was silent as to what role benzyl and methyl played in the activity of the FAAs studied in the prior art.	2.2450574009522524
	The district court applied a lead compound analysis and concluded that, as of March 1996, a skilled artisan would not have selected any FAA, let alone compound 107e (LeGall) or compound 3l (Kohn 1991), as a lead compound.	2.2411851912562275
	In 1987, Dr. Kohn published a paper ("Kohn 1987"), which disclosed the anticonvulsant activity of different structural analogs of the parent AAB compound.	2.2277098131652324
	The district court further found that the data provided in LeGall for that class of compounds showed little potency.	2.219891891636721
	Q1 is methyl.	2.2169214988097092
	Like its parent '729 patent, the '301 patent claims compounds of a general structure and recites several different groups that can be placed at the R and R1 positions.	2.170369248811194
	The four compounds with nonaromatic groups at R3 showed moderate to weak potency.	2.165860116748971
	The '729 patent issued to Dr. Kohn in 1995 and discloses a genus of FAAs.	2.1573957580593706
	We hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that LeGall does not anticipate claim 9 of the '551 patent.	2.129643952388278
	For the R3 position, the '729 patent lists a number of preferred heterocyclics and alkyl and lower alkoxy groups but does not list methoxymethyl.	2.128765307251602
	In fact, the data LeGall did disclose for similar polar analogue compounds showed little to no potency.	2.1263002331766754
	As we have stated, the district court found that LeGall contains no data that would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to select compound 107e among the many compounds disclosed in LeGall as a lead compound.	2.1228437797621655
	Dr. Kohn then summarized his prior FAA work in a 1991 paper.	2.093349339656795
	Kohn 1987 reported results of different groups at each of the different R positions of the general FAA chemical structure.	1.9950718546938733
	The dissent states that the district court erred by not considering LeGall in its primary double-patenting analysis.	1.9939695754306248
	The 1991 paper also identified compound 3l, which possessed "the best activity to date" for any FAA racemate.	1.9652107949410422
	These orientations are designated as either "R" or "S".	1.9098970640331931
	Dr. Kohn explained in this paper that "you get potent protection if you have a benzyl on one end [at R] and a methyl on the other [at R1]." Id. at 506.	1.897375707923987
	As of the March 1996 effective filing date of the '551 patent, no FAA had been approved as an anti-epileptic drug nor had any FAA advanced to clinical trials.	1.8902667592674949
	To date, Vimpat THE-R remains the only approved FAA for the treatment of epilepsy.	1.8733102834328312
	It "fills in the variables of the claim 44/45 equation, so as to narrow the genus of claims 44 and 45 to the species of a single compound, lacosamide".	1.8665576226814296
	Appellants further argue that lacosamide falls within the broad scope of claim 45 of the '301 patent, and is thus presumed enabled.	1.8014642008926474
	Finally, in 1991, Dr. Kohn evaluated "compound 3l," a racemate ("Kohn 1991").	1.7937780113135127
	We do not read the district court's opinion to have required Appellants to prove that benzyl was the best selection.	1.7908356854580179
	Appellants also argue that the district court erred by requiring them to prove that benzyl and methyl were the "best" substituents from which to choose.	1.7862461971325447
	In the study, compound 107e belonged to a class of compounds called "polar analogues" of a parent compound 68a.	1.7621380500583468
	The class of compounds to which compound 107e belonged all contained nonaromatic groups, and as a class, these compounds showed little to no potency, resulting in ED50 values ranging from above 100 mg/kg to above 300 mg	1.7280042783374285
	As the Accord Appellants point out, LeGall expressly stated that he "prepared the racemic amino acid derivatives rather than the individual enantiomers," and that "in each case, the functionalized amino acid racemate was prepared rather than the individual enantiomers".	1.601041882193991
	In 1988, Dr. Kohn also reported data on the racemate and individual enantiomers of AAB and APB (a similar compound to AAB except that it contained a phenyl group at R3).	1.5830015278881409
	A therapeutic composition comprising an anticonvulsant effective amount of a compound according to any one of claims 1-9 and a pharmaceutical carrier therefor.	1.5734806670275565
	Applying a lead compound analysis, the district court concluded that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected any FAA, let alone the compounds disclosed in LeGall and Kohn 1991, as lead compounds in the lead compound analysis.	1.5582868869464201
	Appellants argue that the '729 patent's disclosure that benzyl is "especially preferred" and that methyl is "most preferred" for this genus of compounds itself renders the asserted claims obvious.	1.5053064471239692
	Relying on our decision in Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex, Inc., 550 F.3d 1075, 1084 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the district court held that LeGall does not anticipate the asserted claims because, while it discloses the racemic mixture compound 107e, it does not explicitly disclose the R-enantiomer or its characteristics.	1.4438895083784598
	UCB holds New Drug Applications ("NDAs") that cover its lacosamide anti-epileptic drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and marketed under the tradename Vimpat THE-R.	1.4327684458078433
	The compound according to claim 41 wherein one of R2 and R3 is methyl substituted with an electron donating group.	1.3557060689488976
	The '729 patent also discloses Table 1 containing pharmacological data for 54 FAAs.	1.3538339321787383
	Nonaromatic groups have three-dimensional structures and are not organized into rings.	1.3401291503669195
	The compound according to claim 8 which contains at least 90% (w/w) R stereoisomer.	1.295890646878687
	The specification teaches that "the R stereoisomer is unexpectedly more potent than the corresponding S stereoisomer and the racemic mixture".	1.2777720795569203
	Lacosamide belongs to a class of compounds known as functionalized amino acids ("FAAs") having the following general structure:	1.2613250750958869
	We acknowledge that this is a close case, but because we discern no clear error in the district court's underlying fact finding that there would have been no reasonable expectation of success in placing an unsubstituted benzyl and methyl in the claimed combination, we agree with the district court that the asserted claims of the '551 patent are patentably distinct from the '301 patent.	1.2447389389370669
	Pursuant to the governing Hatch-Waxman provisions, Appellants certified in their ANDAs that the '551 patent is invalid, unenforceable, or that their proposed generic lacosamide products will not infringe the '551 patent.	1.1807391347341598
	A 50-50 mixture of two enantiomers is known as a "racemate" or "racemic mixture".	1.1799188412757025
	The compound according to claim 40 wherein one of R2 and R3 is alkyl substituted with an electron donating group wherein alkyl is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, amyl or hexyl.	1.1717096471920767
	Compound 2g "was found to be significantly more potent than APB [described in a 1988 paper], and at the time in 1990 when this paper was published this was the most potent compound in the FAA family".	1.1716282220604024
	Dr. Kohn continued to explore and publish data for many other compounds with different groups at R3.	1.1340267230062084
	The district court merely quoted Dr. Roush's expert testimony that in the prior art "there is no data to say whether benzyl is best or something else would be the best".	1.1271386595925705
	one of R2 and R3 is hydrogen and the other is lower alkyl which is substituted with an electron donating group or a electron withdrawing group and n is 1-4.	1.123561929807053
	Reference claim 45 covers a genus of compounds known as functionalized amino acids ("FAA") having the following general structure of the formula:	1.0867953714087617
	A method of treating central nervous system disorders in an animal comprising administering to said animal in need thereof an anticonvulsant effective amount of a compound according to any one of claims 1-9.	1.0644563121190527
	Of the top ten compounds with the most potency (i.e., lowest ED50), eight had heteroaromatic groups at R3 and two had nitrogen-based groups.	1.062349273793679
	The compound according to claim 39 wherein one of R2 and R3 is hydrogen and the other is lower alkyl substituted with an electron donating group.	1.0309543727840342
	The district court's fact findings regarding LeGall spanned thirteen paragraphs.	0.9931854615399259

	Compound 3l had instability problems, however, which were of concern for pharmaceutical formulations.	0.9585683571838258
	In any event, even if a lead compound analysis is required here, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected compound 107e as a lead compound.	0.8705414941663565
	Because the district court did not clearly err in finding that there was no motivation to modify the '301 patent's claims to arrive at lacosamide or a reasonable expectation of success in doing so, we uphold the district court's conclusion that claims 9, 10, and 13 of the '551 patent are not invalid for obviousness-type double patenting.	0.850989655908066
	As we held in Eli Lilly, complex compounds like the FAAs disclosed in the '729 patent provide for many opportunities for modification.	0.7903420199135132
	In context, however, it is clear that the district court merely relied on this testimony to support its finding that the prior art data demonstrated a range of effectiveness such that the effectiveness of prior art compounds could not be attributed to benzyl.	0.7585306474800781

	Because we hold that the district court's finding regarding no reasonable expectation of success was not clearly erroneous, we are compelled to affirm the district court's conclusion that the asserted claims of the '551 patent are not invalid for obviousness-type double patenting.3 Also, for this reason, we need not reach the district court's findings regarding secondary considerations and Appellants' argument that the district court failed to find a nexus between the asserted secondary considerations and lacosamide.	0.4910625613003166
