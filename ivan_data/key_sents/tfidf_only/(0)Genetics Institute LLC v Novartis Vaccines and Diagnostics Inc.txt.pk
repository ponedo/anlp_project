	Is Essential for the Interaction of Factor VIII with von Willebrand Factor, 266 J. Biological Chem.	7.2713862874230735
	Scientists further found that the a3 acidic region of Factor VIII is responsible for binding to vWF and is therefore critical to Factor VIII's performance.	6.58458384698932
	By comparing human Factor VIII to porcine Factor VIII, Genetics discovered that, while significant regions of human and porcine Factor VIII were homologous, the large B domain of human Factor VIII diverged greatly from the B domain of porcine Factor VIII.	6.268048335554467
	If Factor VIII is not able to form a complex with vWF, the half-life of Factor VIII in plasma is reduced about five-fold.	5.726214501171598
	The human Factor VIII protein is stabilized in the bloodstream by binding to von Willebrand factor ("vWF"), a large blood protein that prevents the degradation of Factor VIII.	5.521934103906378
	Thus, while Factor VIII retains its procoagulant activity even without vWF binding, the association of Factor VIII with vWF is critical for the optimal regulation of blood coagulation.	5.342836384206295
	To summarize the district court's analysis, the claimed truncated Factor VIII proteins in the ï¿½ï¿½112	4.818122411212637
	Here, the sole "indicated use" of the truncated Factor VIII proteins was the ability to procoagulate blood-not the ability to bind to vWF.	4.721546299490698
	Yet cloning Factor VIII proved to be an enormous technical undertaking, because the Factor VIII protein was nearly ten times larger than any protein previously cloned.	4.491432892388907
	The Figure below depicts the locations of these domains in the full-length Factor VIII protein.	4.482677367801626
	Scientists raced to clone Factor VIII successfully for the first time.	4.433805500360644
	Genetics and Novartis thus competed to clone safer, synthetic forms of Factor VIII.	4.405398925876281
	These claim, respectively, a recombinant DNA whose expression results in a truncated Factor VIII protein; a host cell containing the recombinant DNA; a method of producing the truncated Factor VIII protein by culturing the host cells; and a truncated human Factor VIII protein.	4.394944279560312
	One Novartis expert admitted that there was "nothing in the scientific literature by April 1986 suggesting the importance of [the a3 region] to interactions between Factor VIII and vWF".	4.2404690023232865
	A recombinant DNA which upon expression results in a truncated Factor VIII protein which is an active procoagulant	4.239289569230557
	wherein the recombinant DNA encodes for a protein having the amino acid sequence of a human Factor VIII:	4.237393329395473
	The district court found that research in the Factor VIII field focused on "finding a smaller recombinant protein that mimicked the biological activity of Factor VIII in humans".	4.2215022042199735
	As described below, scientists discovered that portions of the full-length Factor VIII protein were unnecessary for procoagulant activity, and they designed truncated Factor VIII proteins lacking these portions.	4.0855069642784745
	In addition, a Factor VIII protein that cannot bind vWF may cause unwanted clots in areas such as heart vessels because unbound Factor VIII can bind blood platelets even when no injury has been detected.	4.007987671770968
	In this case, the truncated Factor VIII proteins of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent and the truncated Factor VIII proteins of the Novartis patents are not merely homologs, analogs, or isomers-they are all variants of the exact same protein, exhibiting the exact same procoagulant functions.	4.000551497232769
	Genetics' arguments also run contrary to the research objectives of those in the field of truncated Factor VIII proteins.	3.942356615153735
	And one of the inventors testified that the Novartis patents "do[ ] not specifically tell you [the location of the vWF binding sites within the Factor VIII protein], [because] that was not the intention of the patent, to specify the binding to von Willebrand Factor".	3.9336428973373647
	Around the same time, Novartis scientists were researching a more efficient way to clone Factor VIII.	3.9250755083572417

Feb. 24, 2010) (construing a "truncated Factor VIII protein which is an active procoagulant" as a "Factor VIII protein that promotes blood coagulation and lacks a portion of the amino acid sequence of the human Factor VIII protein").	3.912311598133195
	The full-length Factor VIII protein consists of 2,332 amino acid residues-the chemical building blocks of proteins.	3.7810489782173
	Moreover, Genetics' position is belied by the testimony of Debra Pittman, a Genetics scientist who worked with Toole on Factor VIII proteins.	3.7438130467324413
	In particular, the Novartis patents allow up to 10 percent of the amino acids in the Factor VIII protein to be substituted, including substitutions in the a3 region:	3.7374118384561266

	The truncated Factor VIII protein of claims 1, 5, and 9 has the amino acid sequence for human Factor VIII protein except that, in the region between amino acid 740 and amino acid 1690, a number of amino acids are deleted; the size of the deletion ranges from at least 581 to all 949 amino acids in this region.2	3.6227933194542006
	1649.4 Claim 74 claims a host cell containing nucleic acid capable of expressing the truncated recombinant Factor VIII protein, and claim 83 claims a method of producing the truncated recombinant Factor VIII protein by culturing the host cell.	3.5859430781795956
	Q. What steps were involved in going about making the deletion variants of Factor VIII that Dr. Toole had in mind?	3.5628673205584165
	The court noted that these claims differ in terms of the nature of the truncated Factor VIII proteins encoded by the nucleic acids.	3.5159887434291743
	Though it had been known since the late 1970s that vWF had a stabilizing effect on Factor VIII, the location of vWF binding in the a3 region was not known until at least 1988, years after the Novartis patents were filed, as the Novartis witnesses themselves described.	3.507932283257432
	Factor VIII contains the following domains: A1, A2, B, A3, C1, and C2.	3.505403674641474
	Because porcine Factor VIII was nonetheless effective in treating human hemophilia patients, Genetics deduced that the B domain was superfluous and could be excised without compromising Factor VIII's procoagulant activity.	3.5022989473562705
	Any deletion in the B domain, ipso facto, would retain the procoagulation function of Factor VIII.	3.4757748974794693
	All of the patents-in-suit are directed to truncated Factor VIII proteins in which the B domain is either partially or completely deleted.	3.4245519256158827
	A traditionally involved administering partially purified Factor VIII derived from porcine or human plasma.	3.3523635944346397
	Claim 68 claims a nucleic acid expressing a truncated recombinant Factor VIII protein in which all or part of the B domain is deleted.	3.3270275793960593
¡°	Once the feat of cloning the full-length Factor VIII protein was achieved, researchers focused their efforts on finding a smaller, more easily cloned recombinant protein that mimicked the biological activity of Factor VIII in humans.	3.3251671980414637

	This solitary fact does not undermine the district court's decision to credit the vWF binding properties of the proteins claimed in the Novartis patents-properties that Genetics itself concedes are possessed by truncated Factor VIII proteins retaining the a3 region.	3.2592776959000793
	Defects in the gene encoding Factor VIII result in hemophilia A, a genetic disorder associated with prolonged bleeding.	3.2525019710727823
	156 based on the time consumed by testing and regulatory review of its commercial recombinant Factor VIII protein, ReFacto THE-R.	3.2522216164680366
	Genetics argues that amino acid 1649 was one of the known in vivo cleavage sites on the Factor VIII protein, and, on account of this fact, it "would be readily apparent" to make a truncated Factor VIII protein that retained amino acids in the 1649-1689 region, contrary to the teachings of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent.	3.1947062537622988
	The truncated Factor VIII proteins of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent have a "substantially lower molecular weight," ï¿½ï¿½112 patent col.2 ll.10-12, but have "similar procoagulant activity" to the full-length version of human Factor VIII, id. col.1 ll.8-9.	3.174456520517266
	As it turned out, years later, independent researchers discovered that the a3 region had the previously unforeseen benefit of being able to bind to von Willebrand Factor ("vWF").	3.1461373983977885
	Novartis further argued that there was no interference in fact between the asserted claims because the Novartis patents-unlike the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent-are directed to truncated Factor VIII proteins that preserve the functional a3 acidic region.	3.1427578355675934
	The large size of the DNA sequence encoding the full-length Factor VIII protein also complicated the cloning process.	2.9613894702560866
	Because of the large size of Factor VIII, however, yields from the host cells expressing the gene were very low.	2.905711243899729
	740, 744 (1991), available at J.A. 6084-90 ("vWF binding was completely abolished" when "Tyr[osine]-1680 [in the a3 region] ... was replaced by phenylalanine".).	2.8926290750468917
	Recombinant Factor VIII, produced from DNA cloning, offered a safer and more abundant new source of therapeutic material.	2.8855523720219476
	Claim 10 claims a truncated Factor VIII protein having one of three specific deletions: between amino acids 981 to 1563; 759 to 1640; or 759 to 1675.3 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc., ("Novartis") is the assignee of the ï¿½ï¿½620 and ï¿½ï¿½447 patents.	2.8513946742891103
	The objective of the Novartis patents was, similarly, to design a truncated protein with "activity equal to that of cloned full-length Factor VIII[ ]." ï¿½ï¿½447 patent col.2	2.8324278339133127
	For instance, claim 10 of the ï¿½ï¿½ 112 patent claims a truncated Factor VIII protein having one of three specific deletions, two of which are the deletions of amino acids 981-1563 and 759-1640.	2.8074971279845222
	See also Genetics, 2010 WL 677745, at (construing "having a peptide sequence of human factor VIII: C but lacking a peptide region selected from the group consisting of" as "having the amino acid sequence of the human Factor VIII protein lacking only the particular segment of the human Factor VIII protein in one of the specified alternatives (a), (b) or (c)").	2.789587602904062
	While it may have been known at the time of the Novartis patent that binding to vWF helped increase the stability of Factor VIII, there was no indication that the structure proposed in the Novartis patent (i.e., the retention of the a3 region) was any more effective in doing this than the structure of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent.	2.7751741389928313
	The district court's opinion summarizes the science underlying the patented technology in this case, which relates to truncated forms of a protein called Factor VIII.	2.71126325486974
	As of the 1986 priority date of the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent, those of skill in the art understood the inactive B domain of the Factor VIII protein to be "essentially delimited by residues 740 and 1689"-i.e., to include the amino acids in the a3 region.	2.671463373411892
	Genetics asserted that all three patents are directed to the same subject matter, viz., truncated Factor VIII proteins lacking all or part of the B domain while retaining procoagulant activity.	2.6391470221326996
	In support of its position, Genetics cites two articles published in 1984 that disclosed a number of in vivo cleavage cites on the Factor VIII protein.	2.601745687722312
	A more conservative deletion in this range could still leave intact the a3 region critical to vWF binding.	2.596794090466213
	a first amino acid sequence which consists of an amino acid sequence having at least 90% sequence identity with the contiguous amino acid sequence of amino acids 1 to 740 of the native, mature A domain of human Factor VIII and optionally up to 10 amino acids of the human Factor VIII B domain sequence contiguous to amino acid 740 as encoded by the polynucleotide present in plasmid pSVF8-200 (ATCC No. 40190); and a second amino acid sequence which consists of an amino acid sequence having at least 90% sequence identity with the contiguous amino acid sequence of amino acids 1649 to 2332 of the native, mature C domain of human Factor VIII and optionally up to 10 amino acids of the human Factor VIII B domain sequence contiguous to amino acid 1649 as encoded by the polynucleotide present in plasmid	2.5886640276285524
	Genetics maintains that, because the importance of the a3 region to vWF binding was not known as of the filing date of the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent, the retention of the a3 region in the claimed proteins of the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent and their corresponding ability to bind vWF may not be relied upon to demonstrate the unexpected results of those proteins.	2.559759313226748
	C proteins consist essentially of a first polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of the A domain of human Factor VIII: C as encoded by the polynucleotide present in plasmid	2.545439864883664
	At the time, there was concern that pathogens, like the HIV and hepatitis virus, were contaminating the supply of hemophilia treatments made from human Factor VIII proteins.	2.5388446809241314
	The claimed recombinant protein retains the amino acids in the heavy chain (amino acids 1 to 740) and the light chain (amino acids 1649 to 2332, including the a3 acidic region) with the requirement that these retained portions have at least 90% sequence identity to the native human Factor VIII protein.	2.5228069583589354
	Therefore, many of the variants claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent actually conserve the a3 region necessary for vWF binding.	2.495202270287098
	The majority ignores that some variants of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent actually retain the a3 region and therefore have the ability to bind to vWF.	2.47886760871647
	In this respect, the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent and the Novartis patents all teach some variants that retain the a3 region and some variants that teach away from retaining the a3 region necessary for vWF binding.	2.359347130484426
	The patents-in-suit were directed to solving this problem by producing truncated forms of Factor VIII that would nonetheless maintain the same procoagulant (i.e. blood-clotting) activity of the full-length protein.	2.2323641951183837
	As noted above, however, the only evidence of motivation in the present record is that of researchers to make smaller, truncated proteins to solve the cloning difficulties associated with the large size of Factor VIII.	2.222227265258682
	These two deletions clearly retain the a3 region (amino acids 1649-1689).	2.1961580875975772
	In the 1980s, however, human plasma sources had become contaminated with viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis, making treatment with plasma-derived Factor VIII dangerous.	2.166301987176411
	A nucleic acid composition for introducing nucleic acid into a eukaryotic host cell to obtain expression of a recombinant protein lacking all or a portion of the B domain of human Factor VIII, wherein said recombinant protein consists of:	2.1483230262207926
	With the substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine in the a3 region-that is, a "conservative substitution" expressly taught in the Novartis patents-vWF binding would be "completely abolished".	2.0960272396545983
	C except for having a deletion corresponding to at least 581 amino acids within the region between Arg-759 and Ser.1709, wherein the amino acid numbering is with reference to Met-1 of the human Factor VIII: C leader sequence.	2.071896099567296
	C protein which is an active procoagulant protein having a peptide sequence of human Factor VIII:C but lacking a peptide region selected from the group consisting of: (a) the region between Pro-1000 and Asp-1582; (b) the region between Thr-778 and Pro-1659; and, (c) the region between Thr-778 and Glu-1694.	2.0284611070830536
	Retention of the a3 region is also within the scope of retentions allowed by claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½112	2.0016777868436617
	pSVF8-200 (ATCC No. 40190) or an amino acid sequence that differs therefrom in having not more than 10 number % amino acid substitutions, and a second polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of the C domain of human Factor VIII: C as encoded by the polynucleotide present in plasmid	1.991994146652542
	As explained by Pittman, a researcher intent on designing a new truncated Factor VIII protein would first identify the amino acid regions he or she wished to delete, and only then would consider particular protein design strategies:	1.9739790979450862
	The majority does not dispute this, stating that "Genetics concedes that it was not known prior to the filing of the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent that [the a3 region] was critical to maintain vWF binding".	1.9566682020315092
	These proteins differ mainly in one respect: while the Novartis proteins retain the a3 region, the proteins of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent permit (but do not require) deletions in that region.	1.9465021943915295
	That indicates the weakness of Genetics' position and supports the district court's conclusion that mere knowledge of in vivo cleavage sites on Factor VIII would not have provided a sufficient reason for making the proteins claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent.	1.8959723441899357
	Even though Novartis did not foresee the significance of the a3 region to vWF binding at the time its patent was filed, the majority has effectively allowed Novartis to broaden the scope of its claims to usurp the fruits of research by the subsequent, independent inventors who actually discovered the location of vWF binding in the a3 region.	1.8593285961740331
	Factor VIII becomes activated as part of a chain of reactions called the "blood-clotting cascade," which causes the formation of a blood clot to stop bleeding from damaged blood vessels.	1.840129961823666
	The larger deletion ranges from amino acid 759 to 1675, which includes part of the a3 acidic region.	1.8186843716232701
	Notwithstanding that finding, Genetics points to an article published by Leyte in 1991 demonstrating that the substitution of the amino acid phenylalanine for tyrosine at position 1680 in the a3 region eliminated vWF binding but retained procoagulant activity in the resulting B-domain deleted protein.	1.813190856561394
	The dissent, in arguing for obviousness, relies on those claimed proteins of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent that retain the a3 region.	1.736657698499386
	The a3 acidic region, of particular importance to the dispute in this case, contains amino acids 1649 to 1689.	1.7208301351115178
	The only claim at issue in the ï¿½ï¿½447 patent is claim 1, which claims a composition comprising Factor VIII proteins consisting essentially of two polypeptides: a first comprising an amino acid sequence of the heavy chain (A domain), and a second comprising an amino acid sequence of the light chain (C domain).	1.6583478848286102
	The majority, however, ignores the fact that certain variants of the Novartis patents also teach away from keeping the a3 region intact, with the result that vWF binding is not achieved.	1.6562446147541887
	In fact, the parties do not dispute that the protein's ability to procoagulate blood was completely independent of its ability to bind to vWF.	1.6476308922089975
	Yet Genetics concedes that it was not known prior to the filing of the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent that amino acids 1649-1689 were critical to maintain vWF binding.	1.6401673294949464
	It is significant that if Genetics had brought this action at an earlier time-before it was discovered that vWF binding resided in the a3 region-the Novartis patents would likely have been found obvious.	1.629870771483728
	The protein also optionally retains certain amino acids in the B domain: up to 10 amino acids contiguous to amino acid 740, and up to 10 amino acids contiguous to amino acid	1.611834167216049
	The region eligible for deletion encompasses the inactive B domain (amino acids 741 to 1648) and the a3 acidic region in the light chain (amino acids 1649 to 1689).	1.5656936414879046
	Even taking Genetics' assertions as true, however, the Leyte article demonstrates at most that one particular amino acid substitution at one particular position eliminates vWF binding-in a claimed truncated protein of between 1,424 and 1,444 total amino acids.	1.4760793228903923
	Novartis asserts that only the claimed Novartis proteins retain the a3 region and possess the increased stability associated with vWF binding, and even if this increased stability was not known as of the priority dates of the Novartis patents, that property may nonetheless support the claimed proteins' non-obviousness.	1.4685250302752697
	Third, the majority appears to suggest that the "ret[ention] of amino acids in the [a3] region" was "contrary to the teachings of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent".	1.4175749584353803
	It contains a third acidic region, a3, as well as the A3, C1, and C2 domains.	1.390640887736515
	Consequently, the district court did not err in its nonobviousness analysis by considering, as evidence of unexpected results, the ability of the claimed proteins to bind vWF, even if, as Genetics contends, the role of the a3 region was not appreciated as of the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent's priority date.	1.3828656896372462
	ll.29-31, col.8 ll.19-22; ï¿½ï¿½ 620 patent col.2 ll.30-32, col.8 ll.25-29, and where the parties do not dispute that the Novartis inventors' development of the claimed proteins used a technique that excluded any protein that did not bind vWF, J.A. 3707-08.	1.3443971230160474
	Genetics further contends that the district court misunderstood the testimony of its expert, Dr. Phillip Fay, who stated that with knowledge of the deletion points claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent (i.e., amino acids 740 and 1690) it would have been obvious to select the deletion points claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent (i.e., amino acids 740 and 1649) because the latter points were known in vivo cleavage points of the full-length Factor VIII protein.	1.3440647715773604
	As the majority acknowledges, the "typical desire of scientists to find an optimum value within a narrow disclosed range, does not apply to the facts of this case " because "the only evidence of motivation in the present record is that of researchers [trying] to make smaller, truncated proteins to solve the cloning difficulties associated with the large size of Factor VIII".	1.3385390856522783
	If, as the majority concludes, "the structure of a claimed compound and its properties are inseparable for purposes of ï¿½ï¿½ 103," it seems inconsistent to credit the a3 region in the Novartis compounds for giving rise to vWF binding while not doing the same for the compounds of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent.	1.3088228404212907
	The majority also urges that some variants of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent teach away from retaining the a3 region.	1.2686227050781513
	Thus, the ability to bind to vWF was a wholly new and undisclosed function that did not "inherently flow from the indicated use " of the invention-the procoagulation of blood.	1.267468974340114
	One of ordinary skill would appreciate that the claimed truncated proteins vary enormously in structure: for example, the a3 region alone contains 40 amino acid residues and has a relative molecular mass of about 4,500.	1.2031533550101232
	According to Genetics, the court erroneously determined that all of the allegedly interfering claims of the Novartis patents require binding to vWF, when in fact that is not an explicit claim limitation.	1.1965134506305013
	However, a requirement for a motivation to retain the a3 region should not be the test where, from an objective standpoint, no inventor-including the Novartis inventors themselves-could have been aware of the benefits of retaining the a3 region at the time of the invention.	1.193112524216895
	Viewed as a whole, the prior art would not have prompted one of ordinary skill to require retention of the a3 region.	1.1739518126056263
	The similarities in structure and function would provide the requisite motivation to modify the proteins of the ï¿½ï¿½ 112 patent to obtain the proteins of the Novartis proteins.	1.1640627129429983
	Genetics contends that Novartis's proffered unexpected results are not commensurate with the full scope of its claims because the Novartis patents permit amino acid substitution that may reduce or eliminate vWF binding.	1.1568520745324424
	The "light chain" or "C domain" portion of the protein consists of amino acids 1649 to 2332.	1.153038692054127
	Based on this information, Genetics asserts that the unexpected result of improved stability through vWF binding is not commensurate in scope with the claims of the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent, and therefore must be ignored.	1.0977046843110077

	Each disputed claim of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent teaches deletion of the a3 region in some variants, thus leading away from a requirement that that region be retained.	1.0290964342239683
	Even so, the dissent's supposed requirement is an incorrect basis for rejecting the evidence in this case, where the patents expressly disclose the claimed proteins' high stability and ability to bind vWF, e.g., ï¿½ï¿½447 patent col.2	1.0140323901181718
	Genetics fails to explain why, with knowledge of the claimed range of proteins in the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent, one of ordinary skill would have sought out a range encompassing larger recombinant proteins (i.e., proteins having smaller amino acid deletions), such as the range of proteins claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent.	1.0063531210894983
	the location of the permitted amino acid deletions, and the degree of allowable amino acid substitutions.	0.9811512197253908
	Indeed, those same in vivo cleavage sites were known as of the 1985 priority date of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent, but the proteins claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent do not require retention of amino acids 1649-1689.	0.9689913232073495
	However, these differences are of no consequence to the core procoagulation function of the proteins.	0.9584329015755915
	As noted, the ï¿½ï¿½ 112 patent contains 68,000 truncated variants of a protein made up of 2,332 amino acids, and the allegedly interfering inventions differ in terms of the size of the permitted amino acid deletions, the location of those deletions, and the degree of allowable amino acid substitutions.	0.9371087841417248
	That is consistent with the disclosure of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent, which is focused on making "proteins which have procoagulant activity similar to that of factor VIII: C and also have substantially lower molecular weight".	0.9189834131095634
	Finally, the majority found that the later-discovered, undisclosed benefits of retaining the a3 region qualified as unexpected results to help defeat the prima facie case of obviousness, even though the role of the a3 region was not appreciated as of the Novartis patents' priority date.	0.9001662277384945
	That motivation would not have supplied researchers with a reason to make the group of proteins claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent encompassing larger truncated proteins than those claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent.	0.8920640439254485

	The district court explicitly recognized that the claims of the Novartis patents permit substitution (i.e., replacement of one amino acid with another) in up to 10% of the protein's amino acids.	0.8105588296691385

	The ï¿½ï¿½112 patent follows the met-1 system; its amino acid numbers can be converted to the ala-1 system by subtracting 19 amino acids.	0.7994385891696775
	In particular, the deletion in claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent (and, by extension, claims 5 and 9) ranges in size from 581 to 949 amino acids and is located between amino acids 740 and 1690,7 whereas the deletion in claims 68, 74, and 83 of the ï¿½ï¿½620 patent ranges in size from 889 to 909 amino acids and is located between amino acids 740 and 1649.	0.7785008122361833

	The protein contains several regions, or "domains," each of which folds into a three-dimensional structure independent of the others.	0.6902133811204137
	As the district court correctly determined, whereas claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½447 patent deletes the complete B domain (909 amino acids), claim 10 of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent claims three specific proteins, two of which have smaller deletions (581 and 880 amino acids) and one of which has a larger deletion (915 amino acids) than the B domain.	0.6894271245929845
	First, the majority holds that the Novartis patents could not be obvious over the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent unless Genetics could identify "some reason that would have prompted a researcher to modify" the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent to retain the a3 region.	0.6701057999291554

	Common sense dictates that "want[ing] to delete" a particular amino acid region implies that a reason must exist for that deletion.	0.4766799755196819
	As the district court noted, Genetics failed to present evidence showing why one of ordinary skill would modify the protein of claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½ 447 patent to make the three different proteins of claim 10 of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent.	0.4557783932741745
	Consequently, it does not matter whether the deletions are large or small or whether the deletions begin at one amino acid or another.	0.44528679814120176

Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., 367 F.3d 1381, 1385 (Fed.Cir.2004), and Papesch, 315 F.2d at 391, support its decision to ignore that the inventors here knew nothing about the benefits of retaining the a3 region at the time its patents were filed.	0.43956281302019146
	Regarding claim 9 of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent and claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½447 patent, Genetics additionally asserts that it would have been obvious to use the method of claim 9 to make the composition of claim 1, because there is no patentable distinction between a method of making a protein and the protein itself.	0.4365892384755602
	Because claim 9 depends from claims 1 and 5, those claims must also cover ReFacto THE-R.	0.4223883438624452

	Taking claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½447 patent as prior art to claim 10 of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent, Genetics again asserts that "it would be readily apparent" to one of ordinary skill in the art to modify the protein of claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½447 patent to make the three proteins of claim 10 of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent.	0.40175697810870736

	Novartis argues that claims 1 and 5 of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent are not entitled to an extended term because Genetics, in its patent term extension application under ï¿½ï¿½ 156(d)(1), identified only claims 9 and 10 of the ï¿½ï¿½112 patent as relating to its commercial product ReFacto THE-R.	0.2598538837482101

	In view of these structural differences between the proteins claimed in the ï¿½ï¿½112 and ï¿½ï¿½620 patents, the district court correctly required as part of the prima facie obviousness inquiry the identification of some reason that would have prompted a researcher to modify the prior art compounds in a particular manner to arrive at the claimed compounds.	0.1899448078981379

	That is incorrect.	0.002180386503877382
	Although the ï¿½ï¿½ 103 analysis remains properly focused "at the time the invention was made," it would be error to prohibit a patent applicant or patentee from presenting relevant indicia of nonobviousness, whether or not this evidence was available or expressly contemplated at the filing of the patent application.	0.0021236254089826447
