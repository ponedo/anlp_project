	Herron connects each peripheral to the docking module.	3.3567423562344545
	The district court denied CDSC's motion.	3.3491093342075096
	the Invention distinguishes microcomputers from laptop computers.	2.842566462183873
	The ï¿½ï¿½645 patent issued in February 1993 and was later assigned to CDSC.	2.791666950732237
	CDSC stipulated that if the claims are construed to require a computer without a built-in display and keyboard, Defendants' accused laptops and docking stations do not infringe.	2.7838781531537165
	In its amended complaint, CDSC identified a number of defendants' laptop computers and docking stations as infringing.	2.745526019836696
	Herron discloses a laptop computer and a docking module that facilitates operation on a desktop.	2.6231772709653547
	Defendants produce various computer devices, including laptops and docking stations.	2.3676102089823425
	CDSC cannot recapture claim scope disavowed during prosecution to prove infringement.	2.1254038593673075
	CDSC also noted that some of the accused products do not satisfy the all connections limitation.	2.1055289067430603
	Thus, the specification contrasts the microcomputer system with a laptop computer.	2.030514420387401
	CDSC argues that the specification discloses an embodiment with a built-in display and keyboard, specifically the embodiment illustrated in Figures 13-15.	1.9141691438238038
	Thus this reference to laptops, if anything, just represents another attempt to distinguish the invention from the laptops of Herron.	1.8834635985270276
	CDSC appeals the district court's construction of the portable computer and all connections limitations, its grant of summary judgment on both limitations, and its denial of CDSC's Rule 56(f) motion.	1.8722878166917003
	The record shows that each accused laptop computer has a built-in display or keyboard.	1.8259136357505683
	The computer and docking module rest on a desk top".	1.796983992428541
	CDSC submitted affidavits from its employees and its in-house and outside counsel, who attested to CDSC's pre-filing investigation of the patent, prosecution history, and the accused devices.	1.7786702350262478
	Because Defendants' laptops and docking stations do not infringe the portable computer limitation, this court does not reach the issues related to the all connections limitation, including the district court's denial of CDSC's Rule 56(f) motion.	1.7691475288346985
	CDSC admitted that each accused product "includes a computer that has a keyboard and display that are affixed to the housing ... and are not designed to be detached in ordinary use".	1.7586360053247407
	The applicants also distinguished their invention from laptops based on how the devices connect to the docking station.	1.6591844778762799
	Specifically, the applicants stated: "The Herron reference discloses a docking module which is latched to the rear of a lap-top computer.	1.6582663650672973
	This Response to the examiner also referred to laptops.	1.6344872560192765
	Because of its built-in keyboard and display, a laptop could not fit vertically.	1.5683780069578972
	It would make no sense to do so with the Herron lap-top with its attached keyboard and display.	1.5195786037043968
	Instead, the statement suggests that one component of the claimed invention, a single docking connector, could be used with laptops.	1.5010132770256293
	The applicants' statements clearly and unambiguously disavowed computers with built-in displays and keyboards-that is, laptops.	1.4849133877378111
	Figure 13 shows that a keyboard 60 and display 58 "may be coupled with the microcomputer system".	1.441400387575423
	Figure 13 shows how a keyboard 60 and display 58 "may be coupled to the microcomputer system".	1.441400387575423
	The keyboard is neither built-in nor attached.	1.436354669253948
	The Herron system allows a lap-top computer with its own flat panel display and keyboard to interface to other peripheral devices.	1.4162735039791718
	The claims do not recite the term "microcomputer".	1.4144752072305242
	II.29-36, 56-62;	1.4081516910205476
	If the keyboard and display were built-in or attached to the housing like a laptop, these peripheral connections would not be necessary.	1.4068688092938295
	Before filing suit, one of CDSC's engineers dismantled and performed various electrical tests on one of the Defendants' accused products, CDSC engaged in licensing discussions or attempted to do so with each Defendant, and CDSC sent infringement charts to each Defendant.	1.4036368890473485
	Moreover, the applicants further distinguished their system from the Herron "laptop computer with its own flat panel display and keyboard," arguing that laptops did not have the memory capacity, utilities and functionalities of their system:	1.3328503912691587
	With respect to CDSC's decision to file suit, the district court found that the applicants' disavowal of laptops "did not seem self-evident at the beginning of the claim construction analysis".	1.3203676596148328
	If this court had reversed the district court's construction of the portable computer limitation, CDSC might have been able to prevail on the all connections limitation.	1.3085695824894168
	Figure 15 only illustrates that the keyboard may be folded with the display and microcomputer for economy of space.	1.3042854050183026
	CDSC attempted to obtain a final judgment of non-infringement to expedite appeal of the district court's claim constructions.	1.2933762980819201
	For example, the lap-top system of Herron, et al. docks to several connectors making it difficult to align the connectors before docking.	1.269946281787947
	The Applicants' invention is a portable microprocessing system with a microcomputer contained within a housing.	1.2554432190211315
	Because the keyboard and display are not built into the claimed microprocessing system, the applicants described the system as able to fit vertically in the docking station.	1.254979697640865
	Thus, the district court did not clearly err in refusing to find the case exceptional based on CDSC's decision to continue the litigation.	1.205394495414844
	In the same Response, the applicants also contrasted the advantages of their invention with the limitations of the Herron laptop:	1.204272478313064
	The district court also found that CDSC "engaged in a serious effort to evaluate the likelihood of success on its patent claims".	1.1981676691926069
	The Applicants' system, on the other hand, is a portable full service microprocessing system which concedes portability of peripherals.	1.1798673926043515
	Thus, the specification does not suggest that the claimed invention encompasses laptops.	1.1485599166477527
	They also explained that the interface connectors for the keyboard and display are located on the rear bezel of the housing.	1.1412420920383184
	The applicants expressly listed a keyboard and display as peripheral devices.	1.1379395372571282
	In contrast, the applicants emphasized that laptops sacrificed the power of the claimed full-service microprocessing system in favor of built-in peripherals.	1.1347412355364037
	The district court also found that CDSC's decision to continue the litigation after the district court's claim construction did not make this an exceptional case.	1.124664314352491
	The computer in Herron is not oriented vertically as in the Applicants' system.	1.1238830445391506
	In contrast, the specification never identifies the invention as a laptop.	1.1184415793209899
	This statement, however, does not bring a laptop within the scope of the claims.	1.1178716761029075
	The single docking connector is one of several limitations recited in the claims, recited separately from the portable computer limitation.	1.112623554233545
	The docking connector simplifies coupling and decoupling of the main housing with peripheral devices.	1.0895754959808859
	Therefore, Herron does not have the Applicants' reduced footprint size".	1.0785802801120963
	Figure 6 illustrates individual connections between the main housing and each peripheral device; Figure 3 illustrates a connection between the main housing and docking connector.	1.0541469837328659
	The keyboard connects to the housing using connector 24b, shown on the left-hand side of the rear bezel in Figure 6.	1.0369039574092858
	Rather the written description emphasizes differences between the claimed invention and laptops.	0.9795171910312588
	The main housing connects to these peripheral devices either through individual connectors (one connector per peripheral device), or through a docking connector, which "allows all peripheral connections to be realized through a single connector".	0.9761614230446215
	describes a hierarchy of computer systems based on "size and processing ability": mainframe systems, mini-computer systems, microcomputer systems or personal computers, and laptop computers.	0.9694256241757232
	The applicants also stated that the built-in display and keyboard of a laptop would be inferior in quality to the peripherals stored permanently at each location and used with the claimed invention.	0.9567701118456287
	Figure 15 shows the housing as it fits with the display and keyboard.	0.9493973067516442
	Furthermore, the specification repeatedly describes the invention as a microcomputer.	0.9445685948429254
	col.2 II.64-66 ("FIG. 13 shows a possible configuration of the microcomputer system that includes a keyboard, a visual display and a dc power source".).	0.9399186273832553
	And the keyboard shown in Figure 13 is physically separate from the main housing.	0.9365467812876057
	Based on these claim interpretations, CDSC itself sought entry of final judgment of non-infringement, conceding that none of the accused products meets the court's construction of the portable computer limitation.	0.9298058888073716
	A portable computer comprising:	0.9246004854221019
	Each of the asserted claims requires a "portable computer" or "portable computer microprocessing system" (the "portable computer limitation") and a "single connector for making all connections from the microprocessor to said specific computer peripheral devices" (the "all connections limitation").	0.918869479176907
	II.21-22 ("Fig. 1 depicts the main housing 10 of the microcomputer of the present invention".)	0.9088530494287526
	The text confirms that the keyboard is connected to the housing using connector 24b, shown on the left-hand side of the rear bezel in Figure 6.	0.9002989607997202
	The district court construed "portable computer" and "portable computer microprocessing system" in the preambles of the asserted claims to mean "a computer without a built-in display or keyboard that is capable of being moved or carried about".	0.8954194979417581
	; col.2 II.23-34.	0.8716244651925221
	The system also includes the capability to connect to peripheral devices, such as a keyboard or mouse.	0.8663316262637042
	Because Defendants introduced new documents in support of their motion as it related to the all connections limitation, CDSC filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) motion for additional discovery.	0.854290985759971
	At a minimum, the specification does not cut against the applicants' clear disavowal of laptop computers in the June 15, 1992 Response.	0.8503303846101491
	Thus, a cable connects the physically separate keyboard to the main housing.	0.8310416311287389

	In particular, the district court found that the applicants had emphasized the differences between their invention and laptop computers to overcome the examiner's rejections based on Herron.	0.8012045462370512
	As a result, this court finds that the terms "portable computer" and "portable computer microprocessing system" limit the scope of the asserted claims.	0.7917175504209839
	In this statement, the applicants saw that laptops too might find a use for the claimed system:	0.7838277399565288
	The trial court determined that the prosecution history and the specification distinguished the claimed invention from a laptop computer.	0.7768881344454044
	Because the district court held that the statements in the prosecution history amounted to a clear and unmistakable disavowal, it construed the terms "portable computer" and "portable computer microprocessing system" to exclude computers with built-in displays or keyboards.	0.7700053360339497

	Thus, lap-top machines make concessions in memory, display and other areas in favor of portability.	0.7354973007784177
	However, even that requirement can be an advantage over laptop computers in that higher quality peripherals will more likely be used since they need not be transported.	0.7223674166786024
	terms "portable computer" and "portable computer microprocessing system" limited scope of asserted claims; term, "portable," meant capable of being moved about; phrases, "portable computer" and "portable computer microprocessing system," excluded computers with built-in displays or keyboards; examiner's citation of single connection limitation in reasons for allowability did not erase applicants' clear disavowal of laptops during prosecution; applicants' clear disavowal of laptops in prosecution history, based on evidence of pre-filing activities in record, did not mean that infringement action was objectively baseless; and owner's decision to continue infringement litigation after district court's adverse claim construction did not make case exceptional.	0.7116907353275204

	A single connector to implement all of the interfaces provides for easy connection and disconnection and may be used to advantage with lap-top computers as well.	0.6774417878928446
	Rather, the specification explains that a keyboard and visual display are "options available with the system".	0.6768323612556076
