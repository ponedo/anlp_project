	But it binds the fibrin?	6.705752227598079

	Is the binding to fibrin "function," as stated by the majority, or is it part of the "way" t-PA dissolves clots?	5.285019589429455
	Yet, the fourth definition identifies fibrin binding as an essential functional attribute of human t-PA.	5.135267408778011

	I join the opinion of the majority, but I would adopt a different means to interpret the expression "human tissue plasminogen activator" (t-PA).	4.773086978383109
	The definition of "human tissue plasminogen activator"  We next address the question of the meaning of the phrase "human tissue plasminogen activator" appearing in the '075 and '330 claims.	4.743193330442954
	As used herein, "human tissue plasminogen activator" or "human t-PA" denotes human tissue extrinsic (tissue-type) plasminogen activator, produced by microbial or cell culture systems, in bioactive forms comprising a protease portion and corresponding to those tissue plasminogen activators otherwise native to human tissue....	4.699266616940416
	As noted, the specification expressly defines fibrin binding as a critical component of the "function" of human t-PA.	4.696244227879859
	According to that testimony, the specific activity of FE1X using the bovine fibrin plate assay is 253,800 IU/mg.	4.651120247466607
	Moreover, it has ten times the half-life of natural t-PA.	4.575119209875258
	They merely assert that the phrase should be interpreted to cover t-PA "derivatives". "	4.505968240142491
	In your view, does it bind to fibrin in a completely different way than the full-length human t-PA?	4.3369633264825
	A Using a chromogenic substrate assay, and not the fibrin plate assay which appears to be the standard for measuring plasminogen activator activity with respect to these patent disputes.	4.261571046544817
¡°	Human plasminogen activator, having thrombolytic properties, immunologically distinct from urokinase and having a specific activity of about 500,000 IU/mg. using the WHO First International Reference Preparation of t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator) as assay standard or a specific activity of about 90,000 IU/mg. using the WHO First International Reference Preparation of urokinase as assay standard.	4.173429740583864
	As Dr. Goeddel testified, an infinite number of permutations of natural t-PA are covered by these other definitions.	4.152961178764947
	The amino acid sequence of met-t-PA is the same length as that of natural t-PA, but differs from that sequence through an amino acid substitution at position 245 of the K2 region (where methionine is substituted for valine).	4.142364585871887
	is itself defined in functional terms, i.e., as any sequence that encodes human t-PA.	4.113574228223022
	It also has a different amino acid at position 245 (the same substitution as met-t-PA).	4.082556961448241
	Third, what is the literal meaning of the phrase "human tissue plasminogen activator" appearing in the '075 and '330 claims.	4.032378510666571
	You don't know how it binds the fibrin?	4.023452162877746
	For example, a value of 640,000 IU/mg. is reported for the specific activity of native t-PA.	3.9932663072460874
	A DNA isolate consisting essentially of a DNA sequence encoding human tissue plasminogen activator.	3.9700803442269077
	A recombinant expression vector containing a DNA sequence encoding human tissue plasminogen activator, wherein the vector is capable of expressing human tissue plasminogen activator in a transformed microorganism or cell culture.	3.8623624018862874
	Plaintiffs point to the testimony of several witnesses to the effect that the Kringle 2 (K2) region of amino acids is present in both FE1X and human t-PA, and that this region plays a role in the ability of both to bind to fibrin.	3.8403096111409627
	and it has a significantly decreased affinity for binding to endothelial cells43 in relation to human t-PA.	3.828513326386234
	And at your deposition when you were asked about the specific activity for FE1X was measured against the international t-PA, you said it ranged from 350,000 to 450,000 IU's per milligram?	3.6176619419005744
	In concluding that defendants' products did not literally infringe the '603 and '075 patents, the court focused on the "human plasminogen activator" limitation recited in the '603 claims and the "human tissue plasminogen activator" limitation appearing in the '075 claims.	3.60099632262465
	Moreover, I wish to point out an additional reason why I believe that the accused FE1X cannot infringe a claim to t-PA under the doctrine of equivalents.	3.5771542622588393
	The two figures reported for FE1X are very different:	3.5418571024455416
	We conclude that the "function" of human t-PA for purposes of the equivalency analysis includes fibrin binding, and no reasonable jury could have concluded otherwise.	3.52782643946511
	We next consider whether there is evidence in the record sufficient to support the jury's implied conclusion that the "human tissue plasminogen activator" limitation appearing in the '075 and '330 claims is met by FE1X.36 FE1X does not literally meet the limitation-it is not natural t-PA.	3.518159434890086
	The difficulty with that argument is that 25E10 is not natural t-PA, and its disclosure therefore does not aid in interpreting the claims.26	3.492644412825165
	If, as the trial court thought, a broad definition is appropriate-stimulating "the dissolution of fibrin clots through the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin"37-then	3.4857721781659143
	However, if the definition of t-PA set forth in the specification is adopted-catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, [and] bind[ing] to fibrin38-then the equivalence question becomes a much closer one.	3.46994150231769
	A, entitled "TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR," filed by Foundation on May 27, 1986 and published January 7, 1987, at 1, ll.	3.453951073399276
	The jury's implied conclusion that FE1X meets the human tissue plasminogen activator limitation appearing in the '075 and '330 claims under the doctrine of equivalents is not supported by substantial evidence.	3.4467622005150327
	An article contained in the '603 prosecution history shows that this figure was determined using "bovine fibrin films", i.e., a bovine fibrin plate assay.12	3.405104065556224
	The accused compound in this case consists of a protein that contains 446 amino acids, 15% fewer than the t-PA referred to in the claims.	3.4042401468860537
	A process for producing recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator comprising: (a) growing recombinant cells in a growth medium, said cells being a microorganism or cell culture transformed with an expression vector containing DNA encoding human tissue plasminogen activator; and (b) simultaneously expressing said DNA, thereby producing recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator.	3.3216511627836653
	According to Dr. Marder's and Dr. Collen's testimony, the long half-life of FE1X in relation to human t-PA-about 40 minutes for FE1X versus about 4 minutes for human t-PA-is a significant advantage because it avoids the need for continuous administration over a prolonged period in order to remove a clot. "Endothelial" cells are the cells that make up the lining of blood vessels.	3.2856797722927267
	While this appeal was pending, the Wellcome defendants announced their intention to discontinue development of a t-PA product.	3.278138593586536
	And it binds the fibrin through the second kringle region, doesn't it?	3.274951077231001
	According to plaintiffs' allegations, the Genetics and Wellcome defendants acted in concert to make, use, and import into the United States natural t-PA, or variants of natural t-PA, produced through recombinant DNA technology that infringe the patents-in-suit.	3.2677833699438086
	We conclude therefore that the phrase "human tissue plasminogen activator" appearing in the '075 and '330 claims means natural t-PA.27 4.	3.1790751230896697
	The record establishes that 25E10 differs in significant characteristics from natural t-PA, the inventors' testimony to the contrary notwithstanding.	3.1624913814293314
	That term is in fact definite, as it is well established that human t-PA is a protein consisting of 527 amino acids.	3.143995252088358
	Action was filed alleging infringement of three patents describing glycoprotein tissue plasminogen activator and its production.	3.115235612185988
	The Genetics defendants argue that the figure means 500,000 IU/mg. as measured using a bovine fibrin plate assay.	3.1033622614264633
	When they are no longer needed, they are dissolved through the action of plasmin, an enzyme which binds to the fibrin and severs the bonds between the fibrin molecules.	3.0987978183280167
	it is difficult to imagine how FE1X, or any version of t-PA for that matter, would avoid infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because t-PA, or any operative variant, would by definition necessarily perform this function in the same general way with the same general results.	3.090730785502591
	Several materials, such as natural t-PA extracted from human cells, streptokinase, or urokinase, were known to perform this function, although imperfectly, either because, in the case of streptokinase and urokinase, of undesirable side effects and low affinity to fibrin, and in the case of natural t-PA, the inability to derive clinically effective volumes from known sources.	3.08185553402616
	A process for producing recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator comprising: (a) transforming a microorganism or cell culture with a replicable vector containing DNA encoding human tissue plasminogen activator; and (b) expressing said DNA in said transformed microorganism or cell culture.	3.068410654119458
	The independent claims at issue in the '075 and '330 recombinant patents contain no definition for the DNA isolate other than that it encodes human t-PA.	3.0582416340476923
	That entity was, at the time this action was initiated, admittedly constructing a facility in the United States for the commercial production of t-PA.	3.008530685672456
	The t-PA recited in the claims was not copied, since the accused FE1X is a very different material, independently invented and developed, requiring an estimated 130 man-years, and costing $20 million.	2.9932028018083
	Since plasmin circulates through the blood in an inactive form called plasminogen, a mechanism must be provided to activate the plasminogen and convert it to plasmin when a clot is targeted for dissolution by the body.	2.9850901361480426
	All such allelic variations and modifications resulting in derivatives of human tissue plasminogen activator are included within the scope of this invention, as well as other related human extrinsic (tissue-type) plasminogen activators, similar physically and biologically, so long as the essential, characteristic human tissue plasminogen activator activity remains unaffected in kind". (Emphasis added) "The tissue plasminogen activator hereof is produced containing the enzymatically active portion corresponding to native material and the term human tissue plasminogen activator defines products comprising such portion alone or together with additional amino acid sequences up to the full length molecule". (Emphasis added)	2.9719836771935637
	Accordingly, we conclude that the 500,000 figure means IU/mg. as measured using the bovine fibrin plate assay.	2.9245116038509726
	Such a claim avoids that problem only when the term "human tissue plasminogen activator" has definitive meaning, when it describes a specific compound.	2.881696516060565
	They ultimately discovered such a process as well as the intermediate products used in the process, i.e., the DNA sequence encoding human t-PA, the expression vector containing that sequence, and the microorganism or cell culture capable of expressing human t-PA using that vector.	2.8138780938441528
	An additional dosage of a material which activates the plasminogen is often necessary to dissolve the clot rapidly.	2.785295722988261
	They discovered that a commercially useful quantity and purity of natural t-PA could be produced from human melanoma cell cultures.	2.7842592311869305
	Third, there is an even broader structural definition: all products containing just the enzymatically active portion, i.e., the Serine Protease portion.19 Fourth, there is a functional definition: "It is capable of catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, binds to fibrin, and is classified as a t-PA based on immunological properties as set forth hereinabove".	2.726153638638308
	A cell culture capable of expressing human tissue plasminogen activator, obtained by transforming a mammalian cell line with a vector according to claim 3.	2.6930090902849466
	The Wellcome defendants are alleged to have manufactured in the United Kingdom the met-t-PA product, and imported that product into the United States for commercial purposes.	2.587787332386281
	Second, they are based on a synthetic assay which, unlike the bovine fibrin plate assay, does not measure the ability to dissolve clots.	2.557966098882337
	The meaning of "500,000 IU/mg".	2.5240683514318483
	Meanwhile, plaintiff Genentech set about pursuing the same objective, a commercially useful process for producing natural t-PA, but by a different route-recombinant DNA technology.2	2.500996515196758
	That phrase was added to the '603 claims to distinguish over prior work of one of the '603 inventors, Dr. Rijken, in which natural t-PA with a specific activity level of 266,000 IU/mg. had been isolated.	2.4988126655691283
	Thus, all the claims which depend upon a definition of human t-PA are limited to that specific compound and any other compounds considered under law as equivalent thereto.	2.4216174381055766
	238 304, entitled "MODIFIED HUMAN TISSUE-TYPE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR AND ITS PREPARATION," filed by Genentech on March 17, 1987 and published September 23, 1987, at 2, ll.	2.4084154904150448
	In any event, the Genetics defendants argue, the specific activity limitation appearing in the '603 claims is inherent in the phrase "human tissue plasminogen activator" appearing in the '075 and '330 claims.	2.3766088881831404
	Thus, it would be inappropriate to interpret Malta as requiring plaintiffs/appellees to prove the specific mechanism by which FE1X binds to fibrin, or to prove that the different properties and structure exhibited by FE1X bear no relation to the binding function.	2.335470544286753
	Many of these permutations would not be capable of binding to fibrin and would thus be inoperative.	2.31990137690681
	That work had resulted in a specific activity of 48,000 IU/mg., when expressed in terms of the prevailing urokinase standard, and 266,000 IU/mg., when expressed in terms of the new and preferred t-PA standard that had evolved after the '603 filing date.11	2.3112500884071774
	The reduced binding affinity to endothelial cells is likewise a significant advantage because it reduces the risk of uncontrolled bleeding that is present with the administration of human t-PA.	2.279222836098084
	Assuming for the sake of argument that the phrase "human tissue plasminogen activator" is ambiguous, there is no basis in the '330 and '075 specifications and prosecution histories for reading a specific activity limitation into the phrase.	2.2589201166504327
	It interpreted these phrases to mean the full length amino acid sequence of human t-PA plus any "naturally-occurring allelic variant" thereof.	2.2533289839922026
	The specific activity limitation appearing in the '603 claims means specific activity as measured using the bovine fibrin plate assay.	2.1933543340061017
	But Dr. Collen testified that the "consensus attitude" of those who work in the area is that, if an assay is performed "properly and carefully", the resulting measurement for native t-PA should be 500,000 plus or minus 25%, i.e., between 375,000 and 625,000, and that a value above that range was not achievable in nature.	2.0888692412519716
	Apparently, that assay was used so that the figure would be compatible with Dr. Rijken's prior work, in which specific activity was measured using the bovine fibrin plate assay13, and with the work which gave rise to the filing of the '603 patent, in which specific activity was likewise measured using the bovine fibrin plate assay.	2.05891253683747
	Plaintiffs point to the following three pieces of evidence: (1) Dr. Larsen's testimony that the specific activity of FE1X is in the range from 350,000 to 450,000 IU/mg., (2) statements in an internal Institute document to the effect that the specific activity of FE1X is "similar" to that of natural t-PA29, and (3) a publication co-authored by Dr. Collen stating that the specific activity of FE1X is 440,000 IU/mg.30	2.0475767314923283
	In view of our conclusion regarding the specific activity limitation in the '603 claims, we do not need to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the jury's implied conclusion that FE1X met the "human plasminogen activator" limitation appearing in the '603 claims.	2.0272735696211
	When a thrombus occurs, the normal amount of t-PA circulating in the body may not be effective to produce plasmin fast enough to dissolve the clot, and avoid the risk of heart muscle damage or death.	2.009045244575201
	The Genetics defendants are alleged to have manufactured in the United States the FE1X product for commercial purposes.	2.001375808676438
	Included would be the preparation of derivatives retaining the essential kringle region and serine protease region characteristic generally of the human tissue plasminogen activator described specifically herein, but otherwise modified as described above.	1.9825187023819766
	The potential exists ... for the preparation of various human tissue plasminogen activator derivatives, variously modified by resultant single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions or replacements, for example....	1.979063821131586
	The only issues now on appeal then are whether FE1X infringes one or more of the '603, '075, or '330 patents under the doctrine of equivalents.	1.967057325067327
	For example, it appears that some of the products contained within the third definition will not be capable of binding to fibrin because they lack the regions which have been identified as playing a role in the fibrin binding process.20	1.962443927589322
	Thus, a functional definition of t-PA which ignores this distinction would result in a range of equivalents which impermissably reads on the prior art.40 See Zenith Lab., 19 F.3d at 1425, 30 USPQ2d at 1291 n. 9.	1.9544753204766223
	The FE1X protein takes its name from the fact that it lacks the Finger (F) region and most of the Epidermal Growth (E) region of natural t-PA, and eliminates one of the carbohydrate chains by altering the gene at position 117 of the K1 region (where glutamine is substituted for arginine), thereby changing the glycosylation pattern (1X).	1.9502010554013949
	First, there is a narrow structural definition: t-PA produced through recombinant DNA technology but having the same structure as natural t-PA.16 Second, there is a broader structural definition: all products containing the "essential"17 Kringle region, and the Serine Protease region.18	1.9071717984211938
	A process which comprises expressing a DNA sequence encoding human tissue plasminogen activator in a recombinant host cell, said recombinant host cell being a microorganism or cell culture transformed with an expression vector containing said DNA sequence.	1.9012856006006427
	When so expressed, the figure was 90,000 IU/mg.	1.8965626957004236
	Since neither of the accused products contains the full length sequence of natural t-PA or any naturally-occurring variant thereof, the court concluded they did not literally meet that limitation.	1.8496678304578513
	The amino acid sequence of natural t-PA consists of five separate domains or regions each having different functional attributes: the Finger (F) region, the Epidermal Growth (E) region, the Kringle 1 (K1) region, the Kringle 2 (K2) region, and the Serine Protease (P) region.	1.8434771498497602
	But there are literature reports that suggest that the finger region is involved in the binding to fibrin, as well as the kringle two region; isn't that correct?	1.8310318199020768
	It found that that limitation was likewise not literally met by either of the accused products, FE1X, because of plaintiff's failure to prove the specific activity level of that product, and met-t-PA, because the proven specific activity level was not "about 500,000 IU/mg"..	1.8301772437888777
	Plaintiff Leuven then set to work to find a way to produce natural t-PA in a commercially useful way, i.e., in sufficient quantities and at a sufficient level of purity and effectiveness to meet commercial demands.	1.8263076451342621
	To begin with, the specific activity measurements reported by Dr. Larsen were made using the chromogenic substrate assay, and there is no evidence that measurements made using this assay are comparable to those made using the bovine fibrin plate assay.	1.8243907488451854
	At the outset, we are confronted with a problem: The issue of whether the 'way' or 'result' prongs are met is highly dependent upon how broadly one defines the "function" of human t-PA.	1.8175163249366517
	The only evidence in the record which is probative on the question of the specific activity of FE1X is the testimony of plaintiffs' expert Dr. Mann.	1.7845959889425824
	Plaintiffs argue that a protein (25E10) discussed in the specification provides a basis for interpreting the phrase "human tissue plasminogen activator" appearing in the claims broadly, on the theory that claims are to be interpreted in light of the disclosure of examples in the specification.	1.7817401269161994
	A conclusion that the phrase "human tissue plasminogen activator" is also defined in functional terms would give rise to a definiteness problem because a competitor could not then reasonably determine what DNA sequences are within the scope of the claims and which are not.	1.750790096213614
	Thus, unlike the district court, we do not reach the issue of whether the phrase "human tissue plasminogen activator" as it appears in the claims includes within its scope naturally-occurring variants of the full-length sequence.	1.5697242413088273
	As Dr. Mann put it, the difference between the specific activity of FE1X and the claimed range is "outside the range of quibbles".	1.5022598052067873
	A Weakly.	1.4479027844011911
	A Weakly.	1.4479027844011911
	Based on representations made to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) during the '603 prosecution, the court interpreted that phrase to mean something "significantly above" a specific activity of about 266,000 IU/mg., to distinguish the '603 claims from prior work of one of the '603 inventors, Dr. Rijken, in which natural t-PA with a specific activity of 266,000 IU/mg. had been isolated.	1.4457896420033605
	The avoidance of this limitation by FE1X thus cannot provide the basis for a finding of non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalents in relation to these patents.	1.386980631633956
	Second, there was a failure to provide particularized testimony sufficient to support the equivalence finding in relation to the "human tissue plasminogen activator" limitation recited in the '075 and '330 claims as required by Malta v. Schulmerich Carillons, Inc., 952 F.2d 1320, 21 USPQ2d 1161 (Fed.Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 974, 112 S.Ct. 2942,	1.372954462358792
	According to Dr. Larsen, the deletion of the F and E regions standing alone would result in a protein that would be therapeutically ineffective in that it would be incapable of binding to fibrin at all; preventing the attachment of the carbohydrate side chain increases the binding affinity of FE1X sufficiently to make it therapeutically effective.	1.3208794350313995
	The Court of Appeals, Plager, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) specific activity limitation appearing in claims for one patent meant specific activity as measured by using bovine fibrin plate assay; (2) considering prosecution history, specific activity of alleged infringing product did not as matter of law meet specific activity limitation appearing in claim, under doctrine of equivalents; and (3) human tissue plasminogen activator limitation appearing in two of the patents meant natural protein found only in patented product, and jury's implied conclusion that alleged infringing product met activator limitation appearing in patents under doctrine of equivalents was not supported by substantial evidence.	1.2490818823478151

	Considering the '603 prosecution history, the specific activity of FE1X does not as a matter of law meet the specific activity limitation appearing in the '603 claims under the doctrine of equivalents.	1.123439622361631
	After deliberating for two hours and forty-eight minutes, the jury returned special verdicts finding that (1) the accused product manufactured by the Wellcome defendants-met-t-PA-infringed under the doctrine of equivalents the '603 and '330 patents; (2) the accused product manufactured by the Genetics defendants-FE1X-infringed under the doctrine of equivalents the '603, '075, and '330 patents;5 and (3) all three patents were not proved invalid or unenforceable.	1.1070202085973055
