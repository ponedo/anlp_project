	Instead, it used preparatory HPLC to achieve an ISB purity of greater than 99.5%.	6.790340692143133
	Apicore was founded in 2003 and began developing an improved process for synthesizing ISB.	6.18309000470989
	It is clear from the record here that, although ISB was known in the prior art, the path to arrive at ISB with a purity of greater than 99.0% was not known before the relevant date of the '050 patent.	5.300188090999058
	For 26 years following the Food and Drug Administration's ("FDA") approval of ISB, Sigma-Aldrich Corp. ("Sigma") supplied Hirsch and its successors with ISB that was manufactured by	5.230253890823093
	Aurobindo argues that the claims of the '050 patent are anticipated by Sigma's ISB product because a Sigma Certificate of Analysis shows that Sigma made and sold ISB with a purity of 100% six years before the relevant date of the '050 patent.	5.04577720815493
	Mylan Inst. became the sole supplier of the 1% ISB drug product until 2016, when Aurobindo entered the market.	4.8885404383058795
	But, as indicated above, that is not how infringement under FWR is determined.	4.8270378107286955
	However, Aurobindo argues, there is no evidence that the consumer demand for Mylan's product arises from the fact that the ISB it contained was synthesized using silver oxide or that the ISB is at least 99.0% pure; in fact, argues Aurobindo, that information is not available anywhere on Mylan's marketing materials for its ISB drug product.	4.7875545546719085
	The court noted that "without infringing the '992, '616, and '050 patents, Aurobindo would not be able to make the [ISB] product described in its ANDA" because Aurobindo's ANDA application touted greater than 99.0% purity for ISB.	4.7632534438888
	From its inception, Lymphazurin THE-R's production had been plagued by difficulties in synthesizing and purifying ISB.	4.7472172786144435
	at *24, and the failure of all others in the art to obtain an ISB purity of greater than 94.5% until the invention of the '050 patent, id.	4.706388383132033
	The court pointed to the failure of Allied, Sigma, Innovassynth, and others in the art to "reliably" produce "high-purity" ISB for 30 years.	4.567067961174683
	In 2000, Allied stopped supplying Sigma with ISB and, while Sigma was looking for a new supplier, Covidien was forced to notify its customers that it was "completely out of" Lymphazurin THE-R until it could find a new supplier for ISB.	4.544830980959507
	It eventually selected manganese dioxide, and its process resulted in ISB with a 5-10% impurity which could not be removed by recrystallization.	4.472181989493935
	Aurobindo contends that the patented features are the use of silver oxide to oxidize isoleuco acid, and that the ISB employed in the finished drug product is at least 99.0% pure by HPLC.	4.321321582933205
	Aurobindo argued that Sigma had made and sold ISB having a purity of greater than 99.0% six years before the '050 patent priority date.	4.279609753266875
	The district court correctly evaluated the "function" aspect of the FWR test-deciding, in effect, that the function of the silver oxide was to oxidize the precursor isoleuco compound to ISB acid.6	4.1877709022648295
	The '050 patent (which the parties refer to as "the purity patent") is directed to an ISB compound having a purity greater than 99.0%, as measured by high performance liquid chromatography ("HPLC").	4.078958348907853
	The court credited Dr. Sessler's (Mylan's expert) testimony in light of record evidence that the silver oxide and manganese dioxide processes produce crude ISB in similar yields.	3.991576107727367
	Specifically, the court credited Sessler's testimony in light of record evidence that the silver oxide and manganese dioxide processes produce crude ISB in similar yields.	3.9915737389685093
	Around 1981, Hirsch Industries ("Hirsch") developed a 1% injectable solution of ISB, which it commercialized under the trade name Lymphazurin THE-R.	3.9687847014483695
	By 2011, ISB sales were a significant portion of Apicore's revenue and in 2012, Covidien withdrew Lymphazurin THE-R from the market for "reasons other than safety or effectiveness".	3.9410625048786523
	Sigma developed an isolation process to remove the unwanted lead, but the ultimate purity of the ISB it sold was unknown.	3.938629168022701
¡°	Apicore owns, and Mylan Inst. is the exclusive licensee of, the '992, '616, and '050 patents, which relate to ISB, a triarylmethane dye used to map lymph nodes.	3.8078538865149802
	By 2008, Sigma had a new supplier, Innovassynth, which synthesized ISB using ammonium dichromate, resulting in residual chromium impurities.	3.7342945484567376
	Furthermore, Aurobindo argues that the '050 patent would have been obvious over Lymphazurin THE-R itself because the prior art taught the use of HPLC and other conventional purification techniques for purifying ISB.	3.65881674561048
	Sigma reported numerous problems with the purity of Innovassynth's product and eventually developed its own manufacturing process for ISB sometime around 2010.	3.5861387169970684
	Thus, the court determined that a skilled artisan "would readily understand" the phrase and would be able to "elucidate HPLC conditions" for determining ISB purity.	3.584856545176439
	(1) under ï¿½ï¿½ 112 because the "by HPLC" limitation renders the claims indefinite; (2) under ï¿½ï¿½ 103 because the claims would have been obvious over various combinations of art; and (3) under ï¿½ï¿½ 102 because the claims are anticipated by Sigma's manufacture and sale of ISB.	3.5489545706751584
	Hirsch's original clinical trials described the mixture as containing 94.5% ISB as determined by HPLC, with the remaining 5.5% consisting of "closely related isomers" produced during synthesis.	3.503531072080099
	product drove it out of the market due to pricing-not due to the difference in the manufacturing process or purity of the ISB it contains.	3.381867327596224
	The record evidence shows Aurobindo's admitted copying of Apicore's '992 patent, id. at *4, Aurobindo's ANDA promising an ISB purity of greater than 99.0%, i	3.38112376968451
	In fact, the record demonstrates that, prior to the '050 patent's relevant date, a reliable source of high-purity ISB was so scarce that, at one point, Covidien was forced to notify its customers that it was "completely out of" Lymphazurin THE-R until it could find a new supplier for ISB.	3.320110738056373
	Patentee and exclusive licensee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patents directed to process for preparing isosulfan blue (ISB) product by reacting isoleuco acid with silver oxide in a polar solvent, followed by reaction with a sodium solution, and patent directed to ISB compound having purity greater than 99.0%, as measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).	3.254250460485138
	The '992 and '616 patents (together, "the process patents") are directed to a process for preparing ISB by reacting isoleuco acid with silver oxide in a polar solvent, followed by reaction with a sodium solution.	3.1642214841557332
	The district court rejected Aurobindo's argument that the '050 patent claims are anticipated by Sigma's manufacture and sale of ISB because it found that the Sigma Certificate of Analysis related to a compound named "Patent Violet Blue" and it was not clear that, at the time of the issuance of the Certificate, Sigma used that term to refer to ISB.	3.1407308514082106
	competitor did not raise substantial question as to whether purity patent was anticipated, and thus invalid, on basis that ISB was known in prior art;	3.1377669426819357
	Allied's manufacturing process was unknown, but analysis of its ISB indicated the presence of lead, which suggested the use of a lead compound in synthesis.	3.1148225958782576
	Aurobindo argued before the district court that the "function" prong of the FWR test was not met because of the difference in oxidation strength between silver oxide and manganese dioxide.	3.0146606633901167
	(2,5-disulfophenyl)methylene]-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene]-N-ethylethanaminium, sodium salt having a purity of at least 99.0% by HPLC.	2.9821709016178155
	Manganese dioxide and silver oxide are substantially different in many respects.	2.914155618054705
	The district court also concluded that Aurobindo had not raised a substantial question that the '050 patent claims were anticipated under ï¿½ï¿½ 102(b) and ï¿½ï¿½ 102(g)(2) by Sigma's manufacture and sale of ISB.	2.8835229629119947
	The court observed that Apicore satisfied its end of the patent bargain by disclosing its method for preparing ISB and that it would likely not have done so if it had known that a competitor would use that method to destroy its ISB business before it "could make it to trial".	2.877224397210481
	The court found that Apicore's process leading to the claimed ISB product with a purity of greater than 99.0% constituted "an invention of patentable weight itself" and thus that the '050 patent claims would not necessarily have been prima facie obvious over the prior art mixture of (less pure) ISB and "closely related isomer[ ]" by-products.	2.8360060646400242
	The district court here applied the FWR test in evaluating the equivalence	2.7904055413802586
	Thus, there is room for sufficient doubt as to whether silver oxide and manganese dioxide oxidize isoleuco acid in the same way so as to satisfy the "way" prong of the FWR test.	2.784691606020581
	In oxide form, manganese has an oxidation state of +4, while silver is +1.	2.65096171839273
	Thus, the district court reasonably found that, "without infringing the [process and '050] patents, Aurobindo would not be able to make the [ISB] product described in its ANDA".	2.5364737394006633
	Nevertheless, the court made a finding that silver oxide and manganese dioxide are "equivalent" in the context of the process patents, without considering the "way" prong of the FWR test.	2.383446143008403
	The court emphasized that Apicore "stands to lose its entire [ISB] business, ... which it relies on to fund ongoing research and development," and that Aurobindo was aware of Apicore's patented process and copied it.	2.3116014188725424
	Mylan maintains that Apicore's harm is directly caused by Aurobindo's infringement because ample evidence shows Sigma's difficulty in finding an acceptable ISB supplier and that, by admittedly copying Apicore's patented process, Aurobindo gained a competitive advantage.	2.2127029450378104
	The court relied on record evidence showing the failure of Allied, Sigma, Innovassynth, and others in the art to "reliably" produce "high-purity" ISB for 30 years, id. at *20, and that Aurobindo "admitted to the FDA" that it had copied the '992 patent, id. at *21.	2.1903562046331913
	The court stated that "converting the isoleuco acid to isosulfan blue acid is the function of the silver oxide," and then dismissed Aurobindo's oxidation strength argument as "irrelevant" to the FWR and "insubstantial difference" tests.	2.1644094701234886
	However, the two compounds would seem to be substantial equivalents under the FWR test.	2.161378807412699
	Thus, the district court did not evaluate whether silver oxide and manganese dioxide are insubstantially different.	2.133047871269533
	Manganese dioxide and silver oxide may have the same function, but the question is whether they operate in the same way.	2.119665907541727
	Thus, a compound may appear to be equivalent under the FWR test, but not under the substantiality of the differences test.	2.025919716170927
	Finally, Aurobindo argues that the '050 patent is invalid because the limitation "having a purity of at least 99.0% by HPLC" is indefinite.	1.9793145096547096
	But the court did not seem to address that argument, which in actuality related to the "way" component of the FWR test.	1.9760330370427237
	Aurobindo contends that different HPLC parameters will produce different results in a purity analysis and thus, because the claims do not specify HPLC parameters, they are indefinite.	1.9718581663739587
	Aurobindo argues that it had raised a substantial question of infringement of the process patents under the doctrine of equivalents because manganese dioxide oxidizes isoleuco acid in a different way than silver oxide in that manganese dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, whereas silver oxide is a weak oxidizing agent.	1.914998157142843
	The '992 patent further requires 2.0-3.0 equivalents of silver oxide.	1.8441346971174155
	The court found that the difference in oxidation strength between silver oxide and manganese dioxide is "irrelevant" under both the "function-way-result" ("FWR") and "insubstantial differences" tests for equivalence, as applied to the "face of the claims," because the claims do not specify a requirement of oxidation strength.	1.8311775903397807
	Aurobindo sought FDA approval for a generic Lymphazurin THE-R, informing the FDA that it had studied a "number of patents" describing ISB manufacture and selected, inter alia, Apicore's '992 patent, and that it "considered the process described [therein] for the initial sample preparation and further, the optimization of the process".	1.7846152875520493
	Hence, the substantial differences test may be more suitable than FWR for determining equivalence in the chemical arts.	1.7838679687950867
	We will treat that part of the court's analysis as its finding under the "function" prong of the FWR test.	1.7798885066961896
	For example, manganese and silver are in different groups of the Periodic Table.	1.774418345862981
	(1) it is not clear that, at the time of the Certificate, Sigma's use of the term "Patent Violet Blue" referred to ISB because other Sigma documents indicate that "Patent Violet Blue" referred to several blue dye compounds with different structures; and (2) the record established that the Certificate is inaccurate because it "contradicts numerous other Sigma	1.7710822664050523
	In sum, we conclude that the court's equivalents analysis was deficient in its FWR analysis.	1.7665832796230752
	The district court found that the accused process using manganese dioxide was equivalent to the claimed process using silver oxide.	1.6662529630983747
	Although in Graver Tank, the Supreme Court recognized the use of FWR generally in chemical cases, 339 U.S. at	1.6325122742547042
	Accordingly, the district court erred in its equivalents analysis under FWR and we reverse its determination.	1.6103648619196342
	Additionally, Aurobindo continues, manganese dioxide oxidation requires the use of an acid and the patents specifically report the use of silver oxide as not requiring an acid.	1.6102457675952164
	The court's finding was supported by substantial record evidence, including the scientific literature and other patents reporting purity using the same "by HPLC" designation without providing specific HPLC parameters.	1.5751023682353753
	The court explained that if manganese dioxide were a substantially stronger oxidizing agent than silver oxide, a skilled artisan "would expect different results".	1.570008334456271
	The court explained that if manganese dioxide was a substantially stronger oxidizing agent than silver oxide, a skilled artisan "would expect different results".	1.570008334456271
	The court concluded that Apicore's process leading to the purified compound claimed in the '050 patent constituted "an invention of patentable weight itself" and thus the purity claims would not necessarily have been prima facie obvious over the prior art mixture of (less pure) ISB and "closely related isomer[ ]" by-products.	1.5594148213340304
	in a polar solvent with silver oxide, recovering isosulfan blue acid, and treating the isosulfan blue acid with a sodium solution.	1.556512426696827
	Aurobindo acknowledged to the FDA that it was looking for a reagent "other than silver oxide".	1.4586608122897633
	The court found that even Dr. Brown's testimony (Aurobindo's expert) admitted that "purity by HPLC" is typically used in FDA submissions for describing purity levels.	1.4579075479821846
	In doing so, we conclude that the district court's analysis of the process claims under FWR was flawed by being unduly truncated and hence incomplete.	1.4281669738526515
	Further, the court explained that, even if oxidation strength were relevant, it "finds manganese dioxide to be a mild oxidant equivalent to silver oxide in the context of the [process patents]." Id.	1.4220901674520843
	The Supreme Court was surely correct in stating that non-mechanical cases may not be well-suited to consideration under the FWR test.	1.3847356586556525
	In fact, the court appeared to consider the relative oxidation strengths of silver oxide and manganese dioxide as a consideration for claim construction, rather than its equivalents analysis.	1.3510214276527266
	Critical facts that might be considered in an equivalents analysis include the relative oxidation strengths of the two oxidizing agents, as argued by Aurobindo, and the fact that manganese dioxide requires the use of an acid for oxidation, but silver dioxide does not, and results in a different yield.	1.2967430695726647
	But the court failed to consider whether the key reagent in the process, manganese dioxide, was substantially different from the claimed reagent, silver oxide, and hence whether the substitution for, and omission of, silver oxide left the accused infringer outside of the bounds of the claims.	1.2732419636400085
	competitor did not raise substantial question as to whether purity patent was indefinite, and thus invalid, on basis of lack of specific HPLC parameters; and	1.191329271861558
	We note that the district court recognized that the FWR test "may inform whether insubstantial differences exist between a claim element and an accused element".	1.1423575881863244
	Aurobindo supported its position by citing a Sigma Certificate of Analysis, which indicated that a compound named "Patent Violet Blue," with a certain product number and Lot number, possessed a purity that was 100% by HPLC.	1.111547360963512
	It acknowledged that Aurobindo only disputed the "function" of the oxidizing agents, but then stated that "converting the isoleuco acid to isosulfan blue acid is the function of the silver oxide," while rejecting Aurobindo's arguments on claim construction grounds.	1.1111827183862115
	("There seems to be substantial agreement that, while the [FWR] test may be suitable for analyzing mechanical devices, it often provides a poor framework for analyzing other products or processes".).	1.0925009542815798
	Thus, either the district court did not address the "way" prong of the FWR analysis-having considered the relative oxidation strengths to be an issue for claim construction, and rejecting Aurobindo's arguments about oxidation strength because it had not argued for a narrow claim construction-or it performed a "way" analysis without considering critical factors under that prong, namely, the relative oxidation strengths of silver oxide and manganese dioxide, as well as the use of an acid in the accused process.	1.0703028310498774
	Mylan responds that the district court correctly found a likelihood of success on the merits of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because the court properly found that manganese dioxide and silver oxide are equivalent in the context of the process patents.	1.0625602074681952
	In this case, the district court conducted an incomplete FWR analysis while essentially bypassing the substantial differences test, in a situation where the latter test might seemingly be more appropriate.	1.053654626055367
	The court found that the phrase "by HPLC" was a "common and well understood way of designating purity in publications and patents that are relied upon by the scientific and technical community".	1.0491555222060365

	When the case returns to the district court for a full trial on the merits, the court should, in addition to providing further analysis regarding fulfillment of the FWR test, if it determines that it should still utilize that test, also consider whether an evaluation of equivalence under the substantial differences test may be better suited to the particular facts of this case.	0.5690844298195721
