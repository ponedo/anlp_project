	In addition to DNA polymerase activity, naturally occurring RT, known as "wild-type" RT, also exhibits RNase H activity.	4.898455825289153
	First, it was unknown at the time where on the RT molecule the DNA polymerase and RNase H activities resided.	4.879180545619906
	RNase H activity is undesirable because this degradation of the mRNA template negatively affects the ability and efficiency of the RT to make cDNA.	4.217498115629288
	The findings of Johnson suggested to the inventors that the RNase H activity of the RT enzyme resided at the carboxyl terminal end of the molecule.	4.171126062601702
	Additionally, during the summer of 1987, Gerard learned that Goff had presented his RT research at Stanford University.	4.149640424361197
	The inventors spent several years unsuccessfully attempting to locate and delete the RNase H activity from the RT molecule.	4.1050306050437495
	Michael Kotewicz and Gary Gerard, sought to develop a genetically engineered RT enzyme that exhibited DNA polymerase activity but did not substantially exhibit RNase H activity.	3.9361805980478324
¡°	In general, the application claimed an engineered RT enzyme that exhibited DNA polymerase activity but did not exhibit substantial RNase H activity.	3.8039365068478386
	While the inventors knew that Goff had potentially achieved a reduction in RNase H activity in RT enzymes, the inventors were unaware of when these results were achieved, how they were achieved, the degree to which the RNase H activity was reduced, or whether DNA polymerase activity was retained.	3.692953778419004
	Withholding Knowledge of Goff's Work	3.688162618880201
	A few months after confirming their discovery, Kotewicz and Gerard learned that another researcher, Dr. Stephen Goff, was working to develop an engineered RT enzyme.	3.6457549705654912
	During this conversation, Goff stated that he had developed "oligonucleotide insertion mutations that reduce RNase H in cloned RT."	3.632076026359432
	Contrary to expectations, these experiments were successful and, by December 1986, the inventors had created a mutant RT enzyme that lacked RNase H activity but retained DNA polymerase activity.	3.496184818774937
	Further, it was unknown whether the RNase H activity could be selectively removed to produce an improved mutant RT enzyme that retained DNA polymerase activity.	3.4883226881717264
	Reverse transcriptase ("RT") is a naturally occurring enzyme that exhibits DNA polymerase activity.	3.4496965003831432
	RNase H activity degrades the original mRNA template as the cDNA molecule is made.	3.375741158534909
	The inventors, however, were skeptical of Johnson's results because the literature existing at the time suggested that the location of the RNase H activity was at the front end of the RT molecule.	3.162260403390068
	The Johnson article reported comparisons made between amino sequences of certain RT molecules and the sequence of the ribonuclease enzyme from E. coli, which exhibits RNase H activity but not DNA polymerase activity.	3.023154799830156
	During the prosecution of the '797 patent, the inventors were faced with rejections based on Johnson, which taught the location of the RNase H activity, in combination with other prior art references that described the RT enzyme itself.	2.7834141082578823
	Thus, in order to "exclude the possibility" that Johnson was correct, Kotewicz and Gerard decided to conduct experiments at the carboxyl terminal end of the RT enzyme.	2.7025631550261675
	At most, the inventors could have disclosed to the PTO that a rival researcher claimed to have reduced RNase H activity in cloned RT and had presented his results at a conference, which neither of the inventors attended.	2.6233200248202917
	On April 15, 1987, Kotewicz spoke on the telephone with Goff, a researcher at Columbia University.	2.6182417592583653
	DNA polymerase activity enables the RT enzyme to utilize a messenger RNA ("mRNA") molecule as a template to synthesize a complementary strand of DNA ("cDNA").	2.452977233785516
	Patentee brought action against competitor, alleging infringement of patents for engineered reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme.	2.4047707744617677
	Specifically, the court found that the inventors should have revealed that Goff claimed to have developed "oligonucleotide insertion mutations that reduced RNase H in cloned RT," and had presented these results at a conference during the summer of 1987.	2.3727200223749114
	As described above, the Johnson article was extremely influential in leading the inventors to their engineered RT enzymes.	2.3225106292273545
	Kotewicz and Gerard faced several difficulties in developing this enzyme.	2.2599536842960277
	However, there is no indication in the record that Goff revealed any further details concerning his work to Kotewicz during this conversation.	2.1254406350899324
	The inventors were in possession of only very limited information regarding Goff's work.	2.0192404731284794
	They also submitted forms to management at LTI that initiated the process for preparing a patent application for their engineered RT enzyme.	1.9306536266669796
	This was because the teachings of Johnson were contrary to teachings in the prior art which suggested that "something more was necessary" than a deletion at the carboxyl terminal end to eliminate RNase H activity.	1.8502111522028157
	Thus, even though the location of the RNase H activity is taught in the Johnson article, the claimed invention of the '797 patent is not per se obvious.	1.8081828517514933
	Although neither Gerard nor Kotewicz attended this presentation, they surmised, based on conversations with colleagues, that Goff demonstrated "similar results" as the inventors.	1.8041519919939395
	During the prosecution of this application, the inventors revealed their knowledge of Goff's work.	1.7654149528563818
	Clontech contends that this information was material because it indicated that Goff was a prior inventor.	1.762428899287659
	Such a strong statement regarding the Goff information is highly probative of its immateriality.	1.6813374334019031
	They had heard from colleagues that Goff presented results similar to theirs, but the record does not show that the inventors learned any additional details regarding Goff's work.	1.6654754857395924
	It does not matter whether the inventors reached their invention after an exhaustive study of the prior art, or developed their RT enzymes in complete isolation.	1.5890320980765784
	Several times, the Examiner rejected the inventors' claims as obvious over Johnson, often in combination with other prior art that described the RT gene sequence.	1.5844387568038503
	According to the Examiner, because Johnson taught that the RNase H activity was located at the carboxyl terminal end, and because there was a strong motivation in the art to eliminate such activity, the claimed invention would have been obvious.	1.5829891661935191
	The court determined that this was a misrepresentation because the inventors later admitted that the Johnson article correctly taught the location of RNase H activity and led them directly to the claimed invention.	1.5408250302069668
	Knowledge of these details would have been required for the Examiner to consider whether Goff was a prior inventor.	1.487154572223933
	Based on this information, Kotewicz and Gerard urged LTI to allow them to publish their results as quickly as possible, under the assumption that Goff would soon publish similar work.	1.45766879300656
	In response to these rejections, the inventors argued that, at the time of the invention, there would have been no reasonable expectation that the application of Johnson's results would successfully lead to the deletion of RNase H activity.	1.457551745096835
	Moreover, the inventors did not obtain any material information regarding Goff's work based on his presentation at Stanford.	1.352073435906842
	In January 1988, Kotewicz and Gerard filed the parent application from which the '797 and '005 patents ultimately issued.	1.3438930621519987
	Finally, the district court determined that the inventors had withheld material information regarding Goff's work.	1.2875961426302052
	Further, the court found that the inventors' knowledge of Goff's work was material and should have been revealed to the PTO during the prosecution of the '797 patent.	1.284546567239762
	Because the inventors lacked such crucial information, the incomplete knowledge that they did have regarding Goff would not have been material to a reasonable Examiner.	1.0696109848268176
	In response to these rejections, the inventors argued that this combination did not render the claimed invention obvious because at the time the invention was made, one of ordinary skill in the art would have thought that "something more was necessary" than a deletion at the carboxyl terminal end to eliminate RNase H activity.	1.0669525940412394
	The Examiner allowed the application to issue over the newly revealed information regarding Goff, stating that the new information had "no bearing on ... the instant application".	0.9654292471248614
	However, the inventors did not reveal their knowledge of Goff's work because their patent attorney indicated that such limited and incomplete information would not be material.	0.9207885961897314
	This conclusion is supported by the fact that when the substance of the Goff telephone conversation was revealed to the Examiner during the prosecution of the '005 patent, the Examiner stated that the information had "no bearing on the patents issued or the instant application".	0.7969608309328691
