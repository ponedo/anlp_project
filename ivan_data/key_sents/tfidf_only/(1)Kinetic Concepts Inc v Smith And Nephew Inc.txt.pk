	Again, the Bagautdinov references disclose only the draining of purulent wounds; it says nothing about treating wounds within the district court's construction, much less the healing of such wounds with negative pressure.	4.192906075887447
	554 F.3d at 1015 ("Each of the asserted claims in both the ï¿½ï¿½081 and ï¿½ï¿½643 patents requires using 'reduced' or 'negative' pressure to 'treat a wound' or 'facilitate the healing of a wound....' ").	4.1143403193215695
	Zamierowski, instead, uses a tubing system to medicate and drain wounds, and thereby "promote[ ] healing" generally, J.A. 10061-63; J.A. 10074; it does not disclose the use and maintenance of negative pressure on a wound site to facilitate wound closure and thereby promote wound healing, as do the patents.	4.107616100523514
	The Bagautdinov references disclose a device for draining fluid from purulent wounds.	3.91565679012407
	The majority explains that Bagautdinov was "for draining fluid" and was "discontinued when the purulent wound has been cleaned"; that Zamierowski is "used to either drain from or inject fluid into the wound" and was not used "for wound therapy"; and that Chariker-Jeter was a "drainage system" that was "discontinued when the fistula closed or substantial drainage from the fistula stopped".	3.9091910626359807

	The parties agree that the Zamierowski reference's method is utilized on "wounds" within the district court's construction, and discloses placing a screen means into a wound, sealing the wound by placing a membrane with an adhesive coating over the wound, and connecting a tube from under the membrane to a vacuum source.	3.520251452672952
	The Chariker-Jeter references, as explained above, disclose a system for treating wounds that are complicated by a fistula.	3.4891168316347114

	During trial, Wake Forest argued that this reference does not disclose healing wounds with negative pressure because it neither disclosed a seal capable of maintaining negative pressure on a wound, nor disclosed treating the wound towards a selected stage of healing as required by the asserted method claims.	3.450438602068381
	This system can then be used to either drain from or inject fluid into the wound.	3.3691740601889024

	If it does not, the system is not closed and wound drainage will not be efficiently removed.	3.3156695859780267
	In my view, the "healing" limitations are properly construed as requiring only some progress toward healing-for example, the formation of some new tissue or skin-and not complete healing or wound closure.	3.3111170439825854

	Additionally, it is not feasible to suture some large open wounds.	3.2161182969988897
	Finally, Wake Forest's experts testified that use of the drainage system disclosed in the Chariker-Jeter publications was discontinued when the fistula closed or substantial drainage from the fistula stopped, irrespective of the state of any wound healing.	3.202001688942746
	There is also no indication in the specifications that "healing" or "selected stage of healing" refers to any particular stage of healing; the ï¿½ï¿½651 patent simply notes that "an initial stage of wound healing is characterized by the formation of granulation tissue" and that "a selected state of improved condition may include" a number of conditions, including any "stages of improvement or healing appropriate to a given type of wound or wound complex". ï¿½ï¿½651 Patent col. 1 ll.	3.1911056827213504
	Wake Forest timely	3.1684057865494175
	To address these shortcomings, the invention applies "negative pressure to a wound over an area sufficient to promote migration of epithelial and subcutaneous tissue toward the wound, with the negative pressure being maintained for a time sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound".	3.089599233578436
	When the fluidic connection system is used as a wound dressing, an intermediate layer of material can be applied between the wound and the cover membrane inner surface.	3.0701853065856497
	With respect to the contention that "healing" is not accomplished as contemplated by the patents, Wake Forest's expert testified that the Zamierowski reference failed to disclose maintaining negative pressure until the wound has progressed to a selected stage of healing.	3.0195566051065583
	22669:5-8 ("He really does not talk about the healing, maintaining the pressure until the wound has progressed to the selected stage of healing. He doesn't talk about granulation tissue formation, promotion of that".).	3.0142302104770944
	This evidence would clearly be relevant if the patent claims were limited to complete healing or wound closure, but as discussed above, the claims require only some progress toward healing.	3.0136681030845183
	Only the Zamierowski reference discloses treating or healing wounds and only the Chariker-Jeter printed publications disclose a seal that is capable of maintaining pressure.	2.9963027880601527
	The parties dispute whether these references disclose the treatment of a wound within the meaning of the patents, and if it does disclose treatment of such wounds, whether the disclosed device used negative pressure to treat the wounds.	2.9797839289432093
	Shorten the fenestrated drain as necessary so that the flat drain is confined to the wound bed.	2.95666154174133
	With the aid of pictures of Mr. Aderholt's treatment, Dr. Chariker stated that his treatment was an example of the drainage system facilitating the healing of a wound on a patient without a fistula.	2.8986957026649014
	This indicates that the doctors were not using the disclosed devices and methods to heal wounds with negative pressure because they did not believe that these devices were capable of such healing.	2.88550407735398
	As described by the reference, the system, which amounts to a wound dressing, consists of:	2.8828507198979474
	It discusses "a method for vacuum treatment of primary and secondary purulent wounds".	2.8538282872020817
	("A method of treating tissue damage is provided which comprises applying a negative or reduced pressure to a wound over an area sufficient to promote the migration of epithelial and subcutaneous tissue toward the wound and for a time period sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound".).	2.8396281802995067
	Indeed, S & N's own expert testified that the device was "a paradigm shift in wound healing" and that it "is so effective that it's changed the way that [he] and [his] fellow surgeons treat serious wounds".	2.8366314336661094
	For example, the majority states that "the invention applies 'negative pressure ... for a time sufficient to facilitate closure of the wound,' " that Bagautdinov was different from the claimed invention because it was not used "to treat wounds until closure," and that the asserted claims "require wounds to be healed by negative pressure".	2.8069530612322073
	It proffered expert testimony that the purulent wounds described in the Bagautdinov references are in fact abscess or pus pockets not within the district court's construction of the term "wound".	2.7818731072482783
	S & N argues, and the district court found, that the Zamierowski reference also disclosed treating wounds with negative pressure.	2.727731427485221
	These additional limitations in claims 20 and 121 demonstrate that "a selected stage of healing" cannot refer to complete healing.	2.696185654421339
	The device involves placement of a polyurethane foam in the purulent wound, attaching the foam to a pump, and covering the apparatus and the wound with a polyethylene film secured to the skin with vaseline oil.	2.664133771172143
	Nor do the Bagautdinov and Chariker-Jeter references relate to the treatment of wounds described in the patents, as construed by this court in Blue Sky and the district court here.	2.6606532581142495
	vi. interposing a fluid trap between said suction port and said vacuum source; and vii. maintaining reduced pressure of at least 0.11 atm at the wound until the wound had progressed toward a selected stage of healing.	2.6322249049213484
	In addition, Wake Forest's expert testified that the Bagautdinov references indicate that use of the device is discontinued when the purulent wound has been cleaned of infection, whereas the patented method and apparatus are utilized only after a wound has been cleaned of infection.	2.56248784227186
	As Dr. Argenta noted, moreover, if any of the doctors who created the devices disclosed in the prior art thought that negative pressure actually healed wounds, they would have left the devices in place until the wounds were fully healed.	2.536565056604856
	sealing means operatively associated with said vacuum means for maintaining said negative pressure on said wound by contacting the skin surrounding said wound; and	2.5304882574395062
	In fact, on cross examination Dr. Chariker admitted that neither of the Chariker-Jeter publications discloses wounds not involving a fistula.	2.5265523867249704
	Second, to some extent, the majority suggests that the claims require more than some progress toward healing, such as complete healing or closure.	2.487780130259452
	The porous structure of the drain allows for removal of exudate and vacuumization of the wound only from the cavity side.	2.4794898307744804
	In the alternative, the district court concluded that the Zamierowski reference met this requirement because fluid is removed from the wound with negative pressure and removal of fluid enabled healing, so "healing" was "accomplished by the negative pressure".	2.4756948888621992
	Wake Forest's experts testified, moreover, that the device disclosed in the Chariker-Jeter references did not use negative pressure to treat wounds.	2.471514682822122
	Chariker-Jeter II explains that "our clinical observations suggest that fistula effluent does inhibit wound healing.... By minimizing the inflammatory response [associated with the presence of effluent], fibroplasia is reduced. This, we believe, encourages rapid wound contraction and re-epithelialization".	2.462349969552846
	In Blue Sky, we held that the term wound, as used in these patents "does not cover the fistulae described in the [Chariker-Jeter] publications...." 554 F.3d at 1018.	2.456279120391827
	Open and fluff into wound to completely cover the drain and fill the defect to skin level.	2.4550374614263193
	(1) the Bagautdinov references; (2) the Zamierowski reference; and (3) the Chariker-Jeter references.	2.4540892053585424
	The ï¿½ï¿½ 081 patent does not define "facilitating ... healing" (as used in the claim preambles), but it notes that the invention may be used to "promote the migration of ... tissue," "reduce bacterial density in a wound," or "prevent [ ] the infection [in a burn wound] from becoming [too] severe," "facilitating ... healing".	2.4523045125082517
	Significantly, Dr. Chariker conceded that he "didn't publish anything about negative pressure wound therapy regarding fistulas or nonfistulas".	2.448231981084766
	The wound is sealed with polyethylene film in one of several ways, depending on the localization of the purulent focus.	2.435343812274478
	Indeed, Dr. Bagautdinov admitted that he only used his device to treat "infected wounds," J.A. 22312:15-22, and that he "never considered using [his] technique to treat wounds until closure".	2.424522190522934
	(1) a vacuum pump (30); (2) tubing (12); (3) an open-celled foam wound screen (10); and (4) an adhesive seal (18).	2.422859810132478
	One of the Chariker-Jeter publications states that "an increased rate of granulation and re-epithelialization is seen with the closed suction wound drainage system".	2.357679628898589
	ii. locating a flexible adhesive cover over the wound, said cover having a suction port;	2.3329498918816634
	the wound bed thoroughly with normal saline using a 30ml syringe with a 19-gauge needle.	2.322497308591939
	Indeed, the inventor of the Zamierowski device testified that the inventors of the ï¿½ï¿½651 and ï¿½ï¿½081 patents invented the use of negative pressure for wound therapy and that he had not.	2.321652457729576
	The jury was presented with conflicting evidence regarding whether the references treated wounds as construed by the district court, and if they did, whether they treated wounds with negative pressure.	2.321585314224842
	Patentee filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents on apparatus and method of treating tissue damage by applying negative or reduced pressure to wound over area sufficient to promote migration of epithelial and subcutaneous tissue toward wound and for time period sufficient to facilitate closure of wound.	2.3082629640941725
	S & N's experts contended that the references disclosed the treatment of wounds within the meaning of the asserted claims.	2.2682406827872326
	At a minimum, creation of the claimed apparatus or method requires combining the Zamierowski references, which disclose treating or healing of wounds, with the Chariker-Jeter publications that disclose a seal capable of maintaining negative pressure.	2.207039440567521
	See J.A. 22345:13-17 (testimony of Dr. Gordon, S & N's expert, stating that Bagautdinov I disclosed the use of negative pressure to treat a wound).	2.190528033554341
	iii. locating a porous material comprising a synthetic polymer under said cover at the wound;	2.1717627985752586
	vacuum means for creating a negative pressure between about 0.1 and 0.99 atmospheres on the area of skin including and surrounding the wound;	2.1644485201789223
	It is irrelevant that the prior art had the purpose of drainage as long as it used negative pressure to heal wounds within the meaning of the claims.	2.162678212407284
	Finally, with respect to the method claims, substantial evidence supports the finding that negative pressure was not maintained until the wound progressed toward a selected stage of healing.	2.158584059859014
	Finally, with respect to the Chariker-Jeter public use, Dr. Chariker testified that he treated Mr. Aderholt in 1989 with his closed suction wound drainage system. "	2.145650463644709
	The district court was incorrect with respect to its determination that the claims of the asserted patents do not require wounds to be healed by negative pressure.	2.120322890764308
	While we did not provide a definitive construction of "wound," we concluded that construing " 'wound' to include fistulae and 'pus pockets' would [ ] expand the scope of the claims far beyond anything described in the specification".	2.100976746800364
	In other words, the Bagautdinov references explain that use of negative pressure on or surrounding a wound is dangerous to the patient.	2.077144812446415
	During the appeal in the prior litigation, S & N acquired Blue Sky.	2.0275491443694325
	With the exception of the Chariker-Jeter public use, the two Chariker-Jeter publications indisputably deal only with the treatment of "patients with draining wounds and fistulae".	2.0003858536423986
	Thus, at the very least, to find obviousness, a person of ordinary skill would have needed a motivation to combine the treatment of "wounds" by Zamierowski with the seal from the Chariker-Jeter publications.	1.9800457876609843
	('651 patent); J.A. 8267 ('081 patent) (Unlike the prior art, "[the] claimed invention is directed to a device configured to create and maintain negative pressure on a wound site ... for the purpose of administering a negative pressure treatment to the wound".).	1.9763138891214296
	As the majority describes, there is, however, substantial evidence that Bagautdinov and Chariker-Jeter treat pus pockets and fistulae, respectively, rather than "wounds," and that Bagautdinov, Zamierowski, and the Chariker-Jeter public use do not disclose an adequate seal.	1.952769424410752
	As a result of this method, "on average, the wound became clean by day 4-5, with the appearance of granulated tissue.... The average duration of inpatient treatment was 11.8 bed days, compared to 17.2 in the control group; 61.7% of the patients were released with healed wounds and did not require outpatient treatment".	1.9510989382381727
	For this appeal, the court's construction of only the term "wound" is relevant; it construed this term to mean:	1.948617582155191
	First, in the Blue Sky appeal, we concluded that all of the claims of the ï¿½ï¿½081 patent asserted in the present litigation require the use of negative pressure to treat a "wound".	1.9460822016462436
	Turn on continuous suction to the upper range of the low setting (approximately 60 to 80mmHg) and observe the wound site.	1.9419419774751763
	In 2003, Wake Forest and KCI sued Blue Sky Medical Group, Inc., ("Blue Sky") et al., alleging that its gauze based negative pressure wound therapy products infringed U.S. Patent No. 5,636,6433 ("ï¿½ï¿½643 patent") and the ï¿½ï¿½081 patent.	1.934088364405886
	In December 2008, S & N announced it was launching a new foam-based negative pressure wound treatment product.	1.9307119476755423
	The district court was not asked to construe "maintaining," "healing," or "a selected stage of healing" (collectively, "the 'healing' limitations"), but it did rule that the claims do not have a minimum-time limitation, a construction not challenged on appeal.	1.9250347868487525
	This is the central issue on appeal because all of the asserted claims, covering either the method or apparatus, require the use of negative pressure to either "treat a wound" or "facilitate the healing of wound".8	1.9245176269473085
	S & N is incorrect.	1.9192010077491137
	Grp., Inc., 08-cv-102	1.9170809353713496
	For example, Dr. Argenta, an inventor on the patents, testified that he was surprised when a patient with a serious wound "healed completely " after several months of treatment.	1.9127398479502398
	Wake Forest and KCI had demanded a trial by jury.	1.9107110178846483
	And, before the PTO, the patentees distinguished their claims from the prior art by asserting that references "do not disclose or suggest 'an appliance for administering a reduced pressure treatment to a wound'; 'an apparatus/method for treating a wound' with reduced pressure".	1.9077523003930101
	Wake Forest presented testimony to contradict S & N's evidence.	1.9075548622235954
	After surgical treatment of the purulent wound and hemostasis, a drain of polyurethane foam adapted in shape and size is placed on the surface (or in the cavity).	1.9000952358255383
	Nonetheless, defendant-appellee Smith & Nephew does contest the extent to which "healing" is required by the claims, arguing that "Wake Forest attempted to redefine its claimed invention throughout this litigation and continues to do so on appeal" by "mischaracterize[ing] the claims as requiring 'active' treatment of 'clean' wounds for 'extended' periods of time in order to heal the wounds," even though "none of those limitations is in the claims".	1.8972342404616336
	Cut the film dressing or select a size to allow at least 1inch of intact skin beyond the wound edges.	1.8908400076709997
	In light of this assumption, there is substantial evidence to support the factual finding that the Zamierowski reference does not disclose a sealing means capable of maintaining negative pressure, or maintenance of pressure until the wound has progressed toward a selected stage of healing.	1.8875474805989347
	Once the seal is in place, "one end of the tubing is placed through the seal into the foam and the other end is attached to the vacuum pump. The vacuum pump is turned on and, because of the tight seal around the wound, the edges of the wound immediately begin to move together".	1.8623158637657935
¡°	Both patents claim methods and apparatuses for treating difficult-to-heal wounds by applying suction or negative pressure, e.g., ï¿½ï¿½651 patent Abstract; ï¿½ï¿½081 patent Abstract.	1.8361806460816383
	Accordingly, none of the references discloses healing or treatment with negative pressure.	1.8316613616296802
	The Bagautdinov method "accelerates ... sealing of purulent wounds," and "the appearance of granulated tissue" was seen around the fourth or fifth day of vacuum treatment.	1.813189325427571
	As described by the asserted patents, medical "treatment of open wounds that are too large to spontaneously close" is difficult.	1.804676594535291
	iv. adhesively sealing and adhering the periphery of said cover to tissue surrounding the wound to form a continuous seal;	1.7981337184108133
	The language of the "selected stage of healing" limitation itself clearly indicates that only some progress toward healing is required.	1.7965411210652478

	The district court concluded that there was no support for the proposition that these primary references did not disclose the treatment of wounds utilizing negative pressure.	1.743081156049143
	48-49, it nowhere suggests that "healing" is synonymous with "closure," or that "facilitat[ing] closure" requires the application of negative pressure until closure.	1.6965194428420165
	In light of our prior holding in Blue Sky, the language of the specification, and the patentee's statements made during reexamination, we find that each of the asserted claims requires the use of negative pressure to heal or treat wounds.	1.6735099078573008
	Thus, the polyethylene film "clenches" the wound strictly along its edges, and the sorbent makes secure contact with the walls.	1.6719356625288453
	It may be helpful to encircle the cutaneous wound with a pectin-based skin barrier in order to create a "trough" in which to situate the fenestrated drain.	1.6682319953585651
	On this point, the evidence presented in this case by Wake Forest and KCI was just as strong as the evidence presented in Blue Sky.	1.6639202965804316
	Replying to Wake Forest and KCI, S & N highlighted that the jury's verdict of nonobviousness was advisory only.	1.6415479783324827
	With respect to the district court's alternative holding, whether the prior art discloses the limitations of a particular claim is a question of fact to be determined by the jury, and Wake Forest presented ample evidence that the Zamierowski reference does not disclose the use of negative pressure to heal wounds.	1.6352863203522834
	Additionally, claim 20 of the ï¿½ï¿½ 651 patent (upon which claims 109, 116, and 121 depend) refers to "maintaining reduced pressure to promote the formation of granulation tissue," and claim 121 specifies that "the selected stage of healing comprises re-epithelialization of at least a portion of the wound".	1.6233136819869827
	substantial evidence supported finding that prior art references did not disclose treating wounds with negative pressure as required by patents;	1.6159812209192759
	Wake Forest presented conflicting testimony, however.	1.5861885478516584
	"Dr. Bagautdinov is using a variant, or modification of a technique, to aspirate, or to suck out, pus from a purulent wound, which is a pus pocket".); J.A. 21431:15-23 (discussing how Bagautdinov treated pus pockets by lancing and then draining them with the disclosed method).	1.5806905148706805

	substantial evidence supports the jury's implied factual finding that none of these references disclosed the treatment of wounds using negative pressure.	1.5143911691264698
	As discussed above, substantial evidence supports the finding that none of the references discloses treating wounds with negative pressure as required by the patents.	1.5085102018423684
	Its expert testified that all of the patients mentioned in the Chariker-Jeter publications had fistulae, and therefore, that the publications do not disclose the treatment of wounds within the district court's construction.	1.50259046483392
	Id. Significantly, for the present appeal, we also concluded that "wound," "as used in the asserted patents, does not cover the fistulae described in the Chariker-Jeter publications...." Id. at 1018.	1.4960919959061638
	This is the same conclusion we reached in Blue Sky with respect to the Chariker-Jeter references.	1.4945661591589823
	immediately after surgical treatment of the infected area in the commonly accepted manner or using a Scalpel-1 laser, a drain made from polyurethane foam is placed in the wound.	1.4944921144918641
	court had to assume that jury found patentee's expert to be credible and persuasive in his opinion that prior art reference did not disclose use of negative pressure to heal wounds as patents did;	1.4877569721261223
	Wake Forest presented testimony from experts that the patented device "changed the way we do surgery," J.A. 21079:11-12, and "changed the way ... we've been treating wounds for the last twenty, thirty years".	1.4868381876989198
	Because none of the prior art references disclosed utilizing negative pressure to heal wounds, this is not even a case where the inventions at issue are merely composed of elements that were known in the art.	1.4862276813988422
	As the majority describes, the asserted claims cover an apparatus and method for treating wounds by applying suction, or "negative pressure," and Bagautdinov, Chariker-Jeter, and Zamierowski are three groups of prior art that disclose similar suction treatment systems.	1.4728410354554324

	Grp., Inc., No. 08-cv-102	1.4378107050450986
	With respect to these references, the parties dispute their content,7 namely, whether the prior art discloses the treatment of wounds with negative pressure.	1.4375491452324973
	Despite our conclusion that the injuries treated in the Chariker-Jeter publications are not "wounds" within the meaning of these patents, S & N presented testimony attempting to establish that the references disclosed such treatment.	1.4363759288463982
	In reaching that conclusion, however, we determined that the district court committed harmless error by failing to construe the term "wound".	1.429577907944933
	Under the proper construction, the Bagautdinov, Chariker-Jeter, and Zamierowski groups of prior art all meet the limitations of "maintaining" negative pressure "for ... healing" or until a "selected stage of healing" because they explicitly disclose the re-growth of tissue and skin (i.e., the formation of granulation tissue and re-epithelialization).	1.4289518728212771
	The district court concluded that Wake Forest's first argument was incorrect because it found that the patent claims do not require healing to be accomplished by negative pressure.	1.4206096854198271
	One expert testified that he "didn't know how you could put this [negative] pressure on a wound and not cut off the blood supply, not cause infection, etc".	1.3936728666649327
	Highlighting their concern with S & N's proposed verdict form, Wake Forest and KCI explained that:	1.3934758913370748
	However, the party challenging validity, Smith & Nephew, did not seek a jury instruction on the "healing" limitations.	1.384558536870068
	Finally, Wake Forest presented testimony that the method disclosed in the Bagautdinov references could not create an adequate seal, J.A. 21437:25-38:2; J.A. 21433:2-15, and did not treat wounds through negative pressure because the pressure was not sustained for a long enough period of time.	1.3719722192447188
	Finally, Wake Forest proffered testimony that the device has been copied.	1.362748589652505
	To the extent the majority reads a requirement of complete closure into the claims, this seems to me to be incorrect-as discussed above, the "healing" limitations merely require some progress toward healing, such as the formation of granulation tissue or regrowth of skin.	1.358829231078233
	Another expert testified that when a patient with an ulcer that would not heal was healed after eight weeks of treatment, he was "stunned" "because we had used the best techniques we knew to date to close this wound and none had worked and this technique, which was counterintuitive, worked".	1.3532399337524315
	(1) none of the Chariker-Jeter references discloses treatment of a wound within the meaning of the patents (as distinct from a fistula or pus pocket); (2) the Chariker-Jeter references do not disclose use of negative pressure to heal or treat wounds9; (3) the Chariker-Jeter publications teach away from promoting healing by using negative pressure; (4) the Chariker-Jeter public use did not involve the device disclosed in the Chariker-Jeter publications; and (5) the public use did not involve a seal capable of maintaining negative pressure.	1.3279859895384794
	The specifications of both the ï¿½ï¿½081 and ï¿½ï¿½ 651 patents support our conclusion in Blue Sky, moreover.	1.3077095003919443
	S & N's expert conceded, moreover, that the Bagautdinov articles were "particularly concerned about the problems related to putting negative pressure on the area of skin surrounding the wound and the risk of spreading infection, causing tissue damage...." J.A. 22343:5-8.	1.301365589173302
	On appeal, S & N focuses its obviousness analysis on the Bagautdinov references, Zamierowski reference, and the Chariker-Jeter references.	1.2973730938001333
	A "fistula" is generally considered to be a hole in an organ.	1.2855410483945093
	There is also substantial evidence to support the finding that the references teach away from maintaining negative pressure on a wound for extended periods of time because of the perceived problems associated with doing so.	1.263290872343953
	The Zamierowski reference is a Patent Cooperation Treaty Application filed on April 3, 1990.	1.2626618400669336
	Unless one knew that negative pressure could be used to treat wounds, there would be no reason to combine the prior art to arrive at the claimed device and methods.	1.260620885589399
	554 F.3d at 1020 ("We find that the testimony of KCI's witnesses was sufficient to allow the jury to reach the conclusion that the Chariker-Jeter method was not used to 'treat a wound with negative pressure' as required by the claims".).	1.2586164840647236
	At a vacuum of 10 to 60 mmHg the film clenches the wound strictly along its skin boundaries with uniform vacuum treatment of the walls only on the side of the cavity and elimination of exudate because of the porous structure of the drain.	1.2570337108614302
	Furthermore, the unasserted dependent claims 118-120 and 122-124 of the ï¿½ï¿½651 patent provide other more restrictive examples of "selected stages of healing":	1.23956487963736
	And Zamierowski states that it "promotes healing" and that "the present invention is particularly well adapted for the ... regeneration of skin graft donor sites".	1.2210325450956965
	Wake Forest is the owner of the asserted patents, and KCI are the exclusive licensees of the patents.	1.188959823356686
	Indeed, Wake Forest's experts testified that there was no reason to combine them.	1.188815205306533
	In the case of fistula drainage at skin level, the fenestrated portion of the drain is simply centered over the cutaneous opening.	1.1744439654063628
	Finally, the Bagautdinov references and the Zamierowski reference do not disclose a seal capable of maintaining negative pressure.	1.1363272626327094
	Wake Forest University Health Sciences ("Wake Forest") appeals the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law ("JMOL") of invalidity for obviousness.	1.1314587506626859
	Responding to this announcement, Wake Forest and KCI filed this suit, asserting that S & N's Renasys product infringed the asserted patents.	1.1294526293193996

	The ï¿½ï¿½081 claims both require the apparatus to create negative pressure "for facilitating the healing of wounds"2 and to have a "sealing means ... for maintaining said negative pressure".	1.1096668873621276
	Although the parties did not stipulate the level of ordinary skill in the art, S & N's expert testified that the level of ordinary skill in the art "would include health care professionals, for example physicians or nurses, but it could be a podiatrist or somebody else, who has additional training or knowledge about wound care. It could also be engineers with experience operating or designing equipment used in conjunction with wound care".	1.105096762981297
	Wake Forest and KCI asserted that S & N infringes apparatus claims 2 and 5 of the ï¿½ï¿½081 patent and induces infringement of method claims 42, 109, 116, and 121 of the ï¿½ï¿½651 patent.	1.0926232024422675
	Whether the prior art disclosed the treatment of wounds with negative pressure was a key dispute between the parties, see id. at 21, and the district court resolved the issue in its JMOL order.	1.0841299331090763
	Wake Forest presented testimony regarding each of the objective indicia found by the jury.	1.073324255872113
	"While suturing and stapling of wounds is widely practiced, it has a major drawback: the tensile force required to achieve closure with sutures or staples causes very high localized stresses at the suture insertion points, resulting in the rupture of the tissue at these points".	1.066991786010535
	According to the district court, Wake Forest asserted that the level of skill was higher.	1.0561723081257464
	To everyone's surprise, the device completely healed this patient.	1.0554016605436014
	Responding to S & N's motion, Wake Forest and KCI argued that, in addition to the explicit jury findings, the jury's implicit findings necessary to determine the ultimate question of obviousness should be presumed to have been found in Wake Forest and KCI's favor.	1.0392699824576814
	However, I write separately because, in my view, the majority errs in its construction of the "healing" limitations of these claims.	1.0381781801668826
	Indeed, Dr. Argenta, an inventor of the patents, testified that the hospital where he worked was concerned about allowing him to try his device on a patient with a serious wound, which could not be healed with conventional methods, but the "decision [was] do you let [the patient] die or do you try something".	1.0313992785361412
	When this occurs, fistula drain age will accumulate, causing skin damage and leakage outside of the dressing.	0.9945466613453299
	And, unlike the system specified in the patents, Zamierowski's system is to be removed once the process of medication and draining has been completed.	0.9943168676276731
	Because each device independently operates effectively, a person having ordinary skill in the art, who was merely seeking to create a better device to drain fluids from a wound, would have no reason to combine the features of both devices into a single device.	0.9817792079980564
	Regarding the Chariker-Jeter public use, which was not addressed in Blue Sky, S & N proffered the testimony of Dr. Chariker who, while he was a resident, helped treat Mr. Aderholt with the system disclosed in the Chariker-Jeter publications.	0.9788501919266369
	at 1363, is thus incorrect; the majority cites testimony that merely states that Zamierowski does not discuss granulation tissue formation.	0.9722906630575375
	Although the majority opinion does not explicitly construe the "healing" limitations, it seems to make three assumptions as to the meaning of these limitations.	0.9689723328509536
	At the same time, because the accused infringer did not seek a construction of the "healing" limitations, we should assume the jury used the correct construction.	0.9630522373320762
	Under this standard, Wake Forest and KCI argued that substantial evidence supported the jury's explicit and implicit factual findings, and that S & N's motion should have been denied.	0.96232565309588
	Indeed, Harvard Medical School called the device an "exciting novel therapeutic approach to wounds," J.A. 20504:22-05:2, and the American Association of Plastic Surgeons recognized the device as the last decade's "biggest advance in the plastic surgery field".	0.9349254187350746
	In this testimony, Dr. Chariker testified that he used the system to heal Mr. Aderholt with negative pressure.	0.9165491273329116

	At this stage in the proceeding, the obviousness verdict form proffered by S & N was eighteen pages in length, and Wake Forest and KCI's was slightly more than seven pages in length.	0.8636777090809635
	Rather than credit this testimony, however, the district court impermissibly re-weighed witness credibility, concluding that Wake Forest's expert's testimony that Mr. Aderholt had a fistula was "completely unsupported by the evidence".	0.8558363085680076
	On the basis of these findings, Wake Forest and KCI asserted that S & N's motion should be denied because it failed to establish that the asserted claims were obvious as a matter of law.	0.8475632745007069
	Wake Forest offered evidence that leading experts in the field were skeptical that the "counterintuitive" device could work.	0.843863799114342
	However, the claims do not contain a purpose requirement-it is enough that healing is disclosed by the prior art, even if this was not the intention of the prior art inventors.	0.8409537232123452
	(W.D.Tex. Feb. 23, 2010) ("Day 10 Trial Transcript ").	0.8384884401995756
	Because each of these references applied negative pressure for "healing" within the meaning of the claims, it is irrelevant whether these references teach away from more prolonged application of negative pressure.	0.8377393297088481
	Nor is it a case where S & N seriously disputes those findings.	0.8270422103525802
	(W.D.Tex. May 12, 2010) (ECF No. 548).	0.8220734223852868
	As described in Chariker-Jeter II, the drainage system is created by:	0.8212293812885716
	"tissue damage to the surface of the body, including the epithelial and subcutaneous layers, and excluding fistulae and pus pockets".	0.8127041939884334
	Such mechanical closures create tension on the skin, which encourages epithelial migration.	0.8087041248049889
	In light of this standard, Wake Forest and KCI asserted that substantial evidence supported the jury's factual determinations:	0.7949352083050562
	And, Wake Forest's expert testified that the Chariker-Jeter publications actually taught to limit granulization, which is directly contrary to the purpose of the ï¿½ï¿½651 and ï¿½ï¿½081 patents.	0.7878508941832157
	Because the jury concluded that S & N failed to establish that the patents were obvious, we must assume that the jury found Wake Forest's expert to be credible and persuasive on this point.	0.7682393198556849
	In light of the jury's determination that S & N failed to prove obviousness, we must infer that the jury found Wake Forest's experts to be credible and persuasive on this point.	0.7681417664990886
	Nor do the Bagautdinov references provide such motivation to combine the Zamierowski references and the Chariker-Jeter publications to arrive at the method and apparatus claimed in the patents in suit.	0.7621181322905526
	Third, the majority seems to suggest that the prior art was different from the claimed invention because the purpose of the prior art was drainage and cleaning, rather than healing.	0.7575436698023422
	In support of its argument that the Zamierowski reference does not disclose a seal capable of maintaining negative pressure, Wake Forest presented testimony that the reference does not create a seal within the meaning of the patent because it uses only a tight liquid seal that has air gaps.	0.7549598013386081

	To facilitate this division of responsibility, S & N proposed a special interrogatory verdict form:	0.6148952983768707

	Accordingly, the court granted S & N's motion and entered judgment in its favor.	0.5751499542197744
	Significantly, the district court concluded that Wake Forest "presented ample evidence of success of V.A.C. product and the other secondary considerations tending to show non-obviousness".	0.5704353047799875
	The term is sometimes used to refer to Rule 39(c)(1) juries.	0.5626105714894568

	The failure to construe the "healing" limitations affects not only the prima facie case of obviousness, but also the analysis of secondary considerations, as we cannot determine whether the jury's findings of secondary considerations were based on a proper understanding of claim scope.	0.5403312500773844

	On cross examination, moreover, Dr. Chariker refused to say that Mr. Aderholt did not have a fistula; he only stated that one was never diagnosed.	0.5335980658722862
	Finally, S & N never argued before the district court that the asserted claims did not require this limitation.	0.5229662046599026
	On this record, S & N has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted claims are obvious.	0.5229087321685969

	In addition, Wake Forest's expert testified that, based on his reading of Mr. Aderholt's operative notes and pictures of his treatment, the system used on Mr. Aderholt was not the system disclosed in the Chariker-Jeter publications.	0.5060116895051886

	S & N first claims that the district court submitted the matter to the jury under Rule 39(c)(1) and that accordingly, neither the trial court nor we are bound by the jury's factual findings.	0.4858881954675195
	The drain is never placed in the fistula2 tract.	0.4827673079707243
	The majority disregards this well established procedure by failing to directly address the proper construction of the central claim limitations related to "healing".	0.4761847825684801
	Second, S & N did not ask and the district court did not make special findings that Rule 52 requires in all actions tried "with an advisory jury".	0.4569840856238059
	And despite the parties' failure to seek a proper construction of the "healing" limitations, it is simply not possible to meaningfully address the question of obviousness without construing these limitations either by making implicit assumptions about claim scope (as the majority does) or by explicitly construing the claims (as I propose).	0.4563534573029287
	While this determination is not binding on this court, the jury was informed of the results of the reexamination and S & N does not dispute the admissibility of this evidence.	0.45241583065213675
	It is clear, therefore, that the court did not use the term "advisory jury" to denote a Rule 39(c)(1) jury.6	0.44960396123177987
	In the present litigation, S & N asserted prior art that generally falls into three primary categories:	0.44540806836984337
	Crediting their testimony over that of S & N's expert, there is substantial evidence supporting the factual finding that the Bagautdinov references do not disclose:	0.4437581557639469
	As a consequence, all of the cases cited by S & N for the proposition that there are "no factual findings implied within the advisory verdict [that] are binding on the district court" are irrelevant because all of the cases involved actions that are not triable to a jury by right and all addressed Rule 39(c)(1) advisory juries.	0.42903813875070124
	And, rather than filing a motion to have the judgment amended under Rule 52(b), which applies to actions tried before a Rule 39(c)(1) advisory jury, S & N filed a motion pursuant to Rule 50, which governs "judgment as a matter of law in a jury trial".5 Fed.	0.4272135043810349
	Finally, in question 6, the verdict form asked the jury to decide whether S & N had proven that the asserted claims were obvious.	0.4175310033431282
	The jury explicitly found that the prior art and the asserted claims exhibited several differences, which S & N conceded existed.	0.4138199314470715
	We do not believe that the district court intended to invoke Rule 39(c)(1) when it referred to an "advisory jury".	0.4121886520421751
