	neither agreed with Examiner Lev, nor disclosed the existence of Baker to Examiner Trafton.	7.624218678914575
	Examiner Trafton had not considered these combinations of references during prosecution of the ��278 application, and Schumann did not disclose any of these rejections to Examiner Trafton.	6.19151189051223
	As with the ��278, Examiner Trafton was the examiner assigned to the ��195 application.	5.675310792300844
	The second node of communication are [sic]	5.624523342366652
	It is therefore evident that prior to Examiner Trafton's April 6 rejection, Examiner Lev's rejection of three-node communication would have been considered important by any reasonable examiner in Examiner Trafton's position.	5.55476013036961
	Moreover, the telephone system network node of the Hawkins patent is not the analogue to the central controller node in the Baker patent because the central controller node is an internal node entirely separate from any outside network node.	5.256757374868383
	only indirectly connects with an outside network node via the central controller node.	4.986075476827115
	Finally, McKesson points out that because rejected claim 19 discloses two-node communication, instead of three-node communication, Examiner Lev's rejection of that claim is not material.	4.503711410791008
	According to McKesson, these differences, combined with the fact (alleged by McKesson) that the three-node communication system disclosed in claims 15 and 16 is cumulative of prior art already before Examiner Trafton, demonstrates that Examiner Lev's rejection of those claims would not have been of "any particular relevance to Examiner Trafton in the �� 716 prosecution".	4.376843656293181
	Both the version of claims 15 and 16 rejected by Examiner Lev on February 26, 1987, as well as the version of the ��278 application claims rejected by Examiner Trafton on April 6, 1987, unquestionably disclose three-node communication, the existence of which, as Schumann's subsequent statements to Examiner Trafton reveal, was crucial to Schumann's patentability argument.	4.371011463262685
	Moreover, McKesson states, the seventeen-day gap between Schumann's October 6 assertion to Examiner Trafton that none of the prior art teaches three-node communication and Schumann's October 23 interview with Examiner Lev regarding Baker "cannot be evidence of intent," given that the assertion to Examiner Trafton was before the interview with Baker.	4.29482513087109
	McKesson first points out that Examiner Lev cited Baker "solely for its disclosure of a unique address code," and that Hawkins, which was before Examiner Trafton, also discloses that same feature.	4.230232398321777
	And after April 6, when Examiner Trafton did not cite any combination of Blum and Pejas-as he would in the subsequent December 8 office action-the materiality of Examiner Lev's rejection was arguably magnified.	4.1473760831958195
	Moreover, the court explained, this rejection would have been of additional importance to Examiner Trafton because it contradicts the argument for patentability Schumann made to Examiner Trafton on October 6, 1987.	4.008849986429827
	In other words, the base station node in the wireless telephone embodiment of the Hawkins patent directly connects to the telephone system network node, but the analogous subsystem controller node in the Baker patent	3.8822250566765963
	Prior to the issuance of the ��716 patent, Schumann did not notify Examiner Trafton that the claims of the ��372 patent had been allowed.	3.7893294855742954
	While these facts may be evidence that Schumann disagreed with Examiner Lev, Schumann's cancellation of the claims remains evidence that Examiner Lev's rejections could not be easily overcome.	3.735166891133262
	Therefore, the fact that Schumann learned of Baker after his October 6 assertion to Examiner Trafton is of no consequence.	3.707985780372397
	Thus, in Examiner Lev's opinion, Sunstedt's three-node communication system in combination with other prior art references, including Blum, rendered claims 15, 16, and 21 obvious.	3.6890083086708123
	The first of those is McKesson's argument that Examiner Lev's rejection of claims 21 through 23 is immaterial because those claims recite a method of three-node communication, whereas claim 1 of the ��716 patent recites a system for three-node communication.	3.648114998683355
	Here, the district court found under the accepted "reasonable examiner" standard that Examiner Lev's rejection of certain ��149 claims was in fact material to the prosecution of the ��278 application before Examiner Trafton.	3.6460345299967023
	McKesson continues by contending that Schumann did not know and should not have known of Baker's materiality because Examiner Lev cited it during prosecution of the ��009 patent "only ... for its unique addressing feature that was already before Examiner Trafton in the better disclosure of Hawkins".	3.5384561395543943
	We now turn to Schumann's failure to disclose Examiner Lev's rejections in the ��149 application ('009 patent).	3.508648793496346
	The court discounted this explanation as "contradicted by the actual wording of the claims rejected by Examiner Lev, which ... included all of the elements of a three-node wireless system".	3.418112723562155
	We arrive at the same conclusion with respect to Examiner Lev's rejection of claims 15 and 16 on December 1, 1987, in view of a combination of Blum and Sunstedt.	3.3786710492976955
	Id. McKesson offered several reasons why, in its view, Baker would not have been material to Examiner Trafton.	3.3668839459085715
	Using Dayco as a guide, the court continued its analysis by explaining that Examiner Lev's "rejections are material if the rejected claims were 'substantially similar' to the claims pending before Examiner Trafton".	3.354654939880844
	At most, this distinction demonstrates that Examiner Lev's rejection of claim 19 is cumulative because two-node communication was well known in the prior art, e.g., the Hawkins patent.	3.3369505044659165
	Along those same lines, and in light of our holding above that Baker is not cumulative, we must likewise hold here that any citation to Examiner Trafton regarding Examiner Lev's February 26 rejection would not have been cumulative.	3.302497856441447
	Lest there be any doubt as to the materiality of Examiner Lev's rejection, we note that on August 26, 1987, Schumann responded to Examiner Lev by limiting the three-node system of the ��149 application to "real time" communication, see J.A. at 649, and on October 6, 1987-just over one month later-he sought to overcome Examiner Trafton's rejection with a nearly identical argument limiting the three-node system of the ��278 application to "real time, interactive three node communication," id. at 367 (emphasis added).	3.2396456753045677
	This finding was buttressed by the court's observation that Schumann "acquiesced" to Examiner Lev's rejection by canceling claims 19 through 24.	3.1950589682827544
	On December 19, 1988, Examiner Lev issued a notice of allowance for the eighteen remaining claims.	3.1821857632709345
	In a December 1, 1987, office action, Examiner Lev again rejected all claims pending in the ��149 application.	3.1674913350125125
	Reading Schumann's statement to Examiner Trafton in context, Schumann was plainly referring to the differences between the three-node communication system of the ��716 claims and non-three-node communication systems of the prior art, exclusive of any other differences between the claims and the prior art.	3.1639708749861497
	Examiner Lev was of the further opinion that the addition of Baker's unique address also rendered claims 22 and 23 obvious.	3.1616605041949852
	Thus, among the handheld patient terminal, the base station, and the system computer, the ��716 patent teaches a "three node approach to communications".	2.973492324796534
	And as before, the materiality of this rejection was arguably magnified by the fact that Examiner Trafton never cited any combination of Blum and Sunstedt before deciding to issue a notice of allowance.	2.9539434908285656
	McKesson contends that, irrespective of Baker's materiality, the district court clearly erred in finding that Schumann intended to deceive Examiner Trafton.	2.8868338558449973
	In light of these teachings, Examiner Lev suggested to Schumann that he cancel the newly added claims.	2.8767694171894194
	The court also reasoned that given the mere seventeen-day gap between Schumann's "representation to Examiner Trafton that the prior art does not disclose the three-node approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention" and his telephonic discussion with Examiner Lev, "Schumann could not have (or certainly should not have) missed Baker's significance [since] it rendered his recent statement to Examiner Trafton untrue, further confirming that intent to deceive should be inferred".	2.8758317288044046
	However, Examiner Trafton also explained that dependent claim 6 would be allowable if rewritten in independent form.	2.857014188811237
	The third node of communication in the present invention is the portable handheld patient terminal which cooperates with the base stations to provide for wireless transmission of data between the base station and the patient terminal.	2.8559078245866494
	We first discuss Schumann's failure to disclose the Baker patent to Examiner Trafton during prosecution of the applications leading to the ��716 patent.	2.849013426726096
	Insofar as both patents disclose three-node communication, McKesson characterizes Hawkins as being on equal footing as Baker.	2.845501067529464
	Another fact the court deemed significant was Examiner Lev's finding "that the Baker patent rendered the address code in the portable handheld [of the ��149 application] obvious," i	2.834778367694058
	As with the �� 716 patent, claim 1 of the ��372 patent encompasses three-node communication.	2.811818078694121
	However, unlike the Baker patent, only two nodes are described in any significant detail in the Hawkins patent.	2.7668702713746685
	As to the former, simply because Examiner Lev cited Baker for its unique addressing feature did not release Schumann from the relevance of Baker's other teachings.	2.725830312991427
	The court next evaluated intent and found that Schumann did in fact intend to deceive Examiner Trafton by failing to disclose the Baker patent.	2.6947915621526417
	Based on this standard, the court found that Examiner Lev's February 26, 1987, rejection of claims 15 and 16 in the ��149 application would have been important to Examiner Trafton's examination because those claims, which "disclosed all three nodes of the ��716's patient identification system, with the identical means of communication among the core structures," "substantially overlapped with the limitations of Claim 1 of the ��716 patent".	2.6884400422590544
	With respect to Schumann's failure to disclose the Baker patent to Examiner Trafton, the court first noted that until Examiner Lev brought Baker to Schumann's attention, "the same 38 prior art references [had been cited] in the ��716 and ��009 prosecutions [i.e., the ��278 and ��149 applications, respectively]." Id., slip op.	2.6797919910450028
	The totality of this evidence, according to the court, "overwhelmingly established" that Schumann, by withholding the Baker patent from Examiner Trafton, acted with an intent to deceive.	2.672059474879497
	Therefore, the district court did not clearly err by further inferring deceptive intent from Schumann's subsequent failure to disclose Baker to Examiner Trafton.	2.670005275548736
	McKesson also argued, relying on our opinion in Akron Polymer Container Corp. v. Exxel Container, Inc., 148 F.3d 1380, 1382 (Fed.Cir.1998), that Schumann effectively disclosed Examiner Lev's rejections by disclosing the existence of the ��149 application to Examiner Trafton.	2.6599508078426606
	According to McKesson, Schumann was not referring to three-node communication generally, but rather to three-node communication with all of the limitations present in the claims, i.e., "as provided in the claimed invention".	2.646309325929692
	Here, too, the court reasoned that the rejection would have been of additional importance to Examiner Trafton because it contradicts Schumann's October 6 argument for patentability.	2.623266591612999
	Suffice it to say, it is substantially likely that Examiner Lev's rejection of the closely-related three-node system in the ��149 application in view of Blum and Sunstedt would have been considered important to a reasonable examiner confronting the claims of the ��278 application.	2.531832794056012
	We also reject McKesson's attempt to downplay the significance of Schumann's cancellation of claim 22 of the ��149 application subsequent to Examiner Lev's citation to Baker.	2.50921368933595
	Moreover, any differences between the three-node, bar code reading systems of the ��278 application and the related ��149 application are plainly less significant than the obvious differences between the three-node bar code reading systems of either application and the three-node telephone system of Baker.	2.5075608001834606
	As a threshold matter, we question whether Koenig actually discloses a three-node communication system because it appears from the claims that the modem is not a distinct node.	2.5028647418967167
	The district court found this argument unpersuasive in part because "Lev, who already had both the Blum and Hawkins patents before him ..., added the Baker patent to the mix of prior art in the ��009 prosecution, and then relied on it in rejecting claims to a portable handheld terminal".	2.4981416645467833
	With that in mind, we find Bruno to be on point because, as in that case, Schumann had closely related co-pending applications (the ��278 application and the ��149 application) in which a noncumulative, material prior art reference (Baker) was withheld from one examiner (Trafton) but was simultaneously in front of the other examiner (Lev).	2.478024592982232
	It must be the case, then, that the four differences pointed to by McKesson are insufficient to deprive Examiner Lev's February 26 rejection of materiality.	2.4548139046749484
	Examiner Trafton allowed nine application claims on December 16, 1988, and the patent thereafter issued as U.S. Patent No. 4,835,372 ("the ��372 patent").	2.434239042736653
	The court also viewed the Baker patent as "more explicitly and clearly disclos[ing] a three-node wireless communications system than either the Blum or Hawkins patents".	2.366843107204833
	The court further found materiality in Examiner Lev's December 1, 1987, rejection of claims 15, 16, 19, and 21 through 23 of the ��149 application both because of the substantial similarity between those claims and claim 1 of the ��716 patent, and because Examiner Lev "relied on the Baker patent, which had not been disclosed in the ��716 prosecution, to reject the 'unique address' limitation of [claims 22 and 23], which was also a limitation of the ��716 patent".	2.3006337940548054
	Under the correct test for materiality, the allowance of claims to a three-node communication system is material.	2.292102381533092
	On October 23, 1987-seventeen days after Schumann had argued to Examiner Trafton in the course of prosecuting the ��278 application that "none of the references either singularly or in combination teach or suggest ... the three node approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention"-Schumann had a telephonic interview with Examiner Lev to discuss his discovery of a previously-undisclosed prior art reference, U.S. Patent No. 4,456,793 ("the ��793 patent") to Baker.	2.288651518133456
	McKesson thus proposes that the allowance of the ��372 patent could only be material to Examiner Trafton if he would have been likely to reject the ��716 patent for double patenting.	2.2883747792516678
	One of Schumann's primary arguments for the patentability of the claims of the �� 716 patent was the use of three-node communication.	2.249647039147365
	On June 17, 1988, Schumann responded to Examiner Lev's rejection by further narrowing application claim 15 to encompass only handheld terminals capable of initiating communication themselves, as opposed to the system taught by Sunstedt requiring intermittent polling to initiate communication.	2.2416549795857605
	Taken together, these two observations led the court to conclude that "the Baker patent meets the 'reasonable examiner' materiality standard and should have been disclosed to Examiner Trafton".	2.1995681784610275
	The court explained, in accordance with expert testimony elicited at trial, that "Schumann could not have made this patentability argument if Examiner Trafton had the opportunity to consider the Baker patent".	2.183838764587259
	And because the cancelled claims "included, according to Mr. Schumann's own admission, aspects of the invention under review [by Examiner Trafton], Mr. Schumann either knew or should have known that the Baker patent was material in the ��716 case".	2.1822627090809257
	Thus, claim 19 teaches two-node communication, claim 21 teaches three-node communication, claim 22 teaches the addition of a "unique address" limitation, and claim 23 teaches a programmable unique address.	2.1304247923321853
	In a December 8, 1987, office action, Examiner Trafton maintained his rejection of amended claim 1, albeit based upon a different combination of prior art references patents to Blum and Pejas.	2.1133053787686986
	We reject this argument because it is nothing more than an attempt to rehash an argument rejected above, namely, that Baker is cumulative of the prior art that was already in front of Examiner Trafton.	2.0965552727154106
	The only independent claim of the ��716 patent incorporates both of these features-i.e., three-node communications and a programmable unique identifier-as limitations.	2.0883255304115904
	Thus, we find no clear error in the district court's conclusion that Baker discloses three-node communication more clearly than Hawkins.	2.073375482178954
	The most McKesson can argue is that the allowance is cumulative by virtue of the fact that Examiner Trafton, as the ��278 examiner, probably remembered allowing the ��372 claims and then realized the materiality of such allowance to the ��278 application claims.	2.068103262844197
	As we stated above, Schumann sought to overcome this rejection by further limiting the three-node system of the ��149 application to handheld terminals that do not require the polling taught by Sunstedt, but rather are capable of initiating communication themselves.	2.061667271525051
	As we explained above, Baker discloses two of the ��716 patent's points of novelty: three-node communication and unique addressing.	2.0591737805378183
	at 25. "Clearly," the court continued, "Examiner Lev did not view Baker as cumulative, but rather treated it as an important addition to the prior art previously cited by Mr. Schumann".	2.054345888344379
	Schumann accepted this offer on June 8, 1988, by abandoning the ��278 application and filing a continuation application (Application No. 07/205,527) with the only independent claim rewritten in the manner suggested by Examiner Trafton.	2.0163759411700632
	Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Schumann intended to deceive the PTO by not disclosing the two rejections in the ��149 application to Examiner Trafton.	2.010477363684257
	With respect to Examiner Lev's rejection of claims 19 and 21 through 23 in the same December 1 office action, McKesson raises a few additional materiality arguments we have not yet addressed.	1.998138658515159
	The base stations of the ��716 patent therefore include "a programmable unique identifier" that "only allows communication with a portable handheld patient terminal ... having a corresponding program identifier".	1.9777545591975763
	McKesson further argues that "the art of record showed at least twelve three-node systems" in order to demonstrate that Baker is cumulative.	1.9397915449871825
	With that test for materiality in mind, the district court's stated basis for finding materiality-the conceivability of a double patenting rejection-is not incorrect because allowance of the three-node system of the ��372 patent claims plainly gives rise to a conceivable double patenting rejection, particularly in light of Examiner Lev's conclusion during examination of the �� 149 application that the addition of Baker's unique address limitation to the three-node system of Sunstedt was obvious.	1.8887868898085043
	In addition, the evidence unquestionably shows that Schumann understood Baker to disclose at least unique addressing, and that Schumann should have understood Baker to disclose three-node communication.	1.8770730424173732
	Here, as in Li Second Family, we are presented with a situation in which (1) the examiner of one application (Trafton) was not apprised of the adverse decisions by another examiner (Lev) in a closely-related application; (2) the applicant disclosed the closely-related application only in the context of prior art cited in that application, but failed to mention the adverse decisions; and (3) the applicant made statements to the examiner inconsistent with the other examiner's decisions, i.e., that nothing in the prior art disclosed three-node communication.	1.8683322316268793
	During this same time period, Schumann was simultaneously prosecuting another application-Application No. 06/862,149 ("the ��149 application")-before another PTO examiner, Robert Lev. The invention of this simultaneous application was similar to the invention of the ��716 patent-so similar, in fact, that Schumann initially disclosed the same body of prior art with both applications. J.A. at 2400. The first submitted version of the ��149 application included application claims 15 and 16, which together teach three-node communication: 15. A portable handheld terminal, including: (a) a portable handheld terminal, including: (i) a housing having first and second spaced apart, opposing major surfaces extending longitudinally of the housing between first and second end portions; (ii) keyboard means disposed on the first surface for entering data; (iii) display means disposed on the first surface for displaying data; (iv) optical sensor means disposed in the housing for sensing bar code indicia; (v) RF transceiver means contained in the housing for transmitting and receiving RF signals; (vi) control means contained in the housing and operatively interconnected to the keyboard means, display means, optical sensor means, and RF transceiver means for controlling operation of the portable handheld terminal; and (vii) power supply means for powering the portable handheld terminal; and (b) base station means including RF transceiver means for communication with the portable handheld terminal. 16. A system in accordance with claim 15, wherein the base station means includes: (a) programmed microprocessor and memory means for controlling communication between the portable handheld terminal and a central computer system electrically wired to the base station means; (b) power supply means for powering the base station means; (c) charger assembly means for charging the power supply means of the portable handheld terminal; (d) data over voice (DOV) means for communication with the central computer by telephone wires using data over voice techniques; and (e) RF transceiver means for wireless communication with the portable handheld terminal. See J.A. at 645-46 (emphasis added). In a February 26, 1987, office action, Examiner Lev rejected these claims as obvious over a combination of prior art references including the patents to Blum and Pejas. J.A. at 636. Although both of these prior art references were in front of Examiner Trafton prior to his April 6, 1987, rejection of the three-node communication system of the ��278 application, see J.A. at 347, 355, Examiner Trafton did not cite the combination of Blum and Pejas in that rejection, see J.A. at 354. And, although Schumann disclosed the existence of the co-pending ��149 application to Examiner Trafton on or about August 12, 1986, J.A. at 339, Schumann did not bring Examiner Lev's rejection of application claims 15 and 16 to Examiner Trafton's attention. Schumann responded on August 26, 1987, to Examiner Lev's rejection by narrowing claim 15 to encompass only "real time data communication".	1.8463451557725021
	Admittedly, in the wireless telephone embodiment, this system is capable of connecting to a third communication node, i.e., a telephone system network.	1.8199008419456908
	Schumann thus was not entitled to assume that Examiner Trafton would recall his decision to grant the claims of the ��372 patent when he was examining the ��278 application in the absence of a written disclosure to that effect.	1.8011141295536575
	The district court disagreed, finding that although the claims of the ��372 patent do not have a comparable "programmable unique identifier" limitation, "Examiner Trafton should have been given the opportunity to consider whether the added limitations in the ��716 were non-obvious".	1.7854434570565212
	Thus, Pejas appears to disclose both three-node communication (pen/terminal to converter to control center), as well as a unique addressing scheme analogous to the programmable unique identifier limitation of the ��716 patent.	1.783673307497132
	Indeed," the court continued, "given that Examiner Lev had rejected the 'unique identifier' as obvious ..., it is certainly conceivable that the ��716 could have been rejected under the doctrine of obviousness-type double patenting".	1.777003382392083
	We agree with McKesson's assertion that Akron Polymer earns it some credit for the fact that Schumann did disclose the co-pendency of the ��149 application to Examiner Trafton in the assessment of the overall inferences to be drawn from all the facts in the case.	1.7637198897265995
	The Blum reference, U.S. Patent No. 4,628,193 ("the ��193 patent"), describes a portable handheld device useful in a hospital setting.	1.7388755178843032
	In the present invention, the first node of communication is a main or central computer which may have its own terminals for entry/display of information.	1.7312256690923078
	A method in accordance with claim 22, further including the step of programming with the base station, the portable handheld terminal to transmit the unique address.	1.7296725481296102
	The mere seventeen-day gap is important, however, because it bolsters the district court's inferences that Schumann knew or should have known of Baker's materiality to the ��278 application, and that he intentionally withheld Baker from Examiner Trafton with deceptive intent.	1.717499576517253
	Another perceived error pointed to by McKesson is the district court's alleged failure to consider the fact that Examiner Trafton was the examiner who allowed the ��372 claims, and that he did so within a few months of allowing the ��716 claims.	1.7039143908697056
	Moreover, because the handheld patient terminals are portable, it is desirable to prevent one such terminal from wirelessly communicating with a base station in, say, an adjacent room.	1.6850413475135329
	Irrespective of Schumann's disagreement with Examiner Lev's conclusion that claim 22-which incorporated both three-node communication and a unique address limitation-was obvious in light of a combination involving Baker, Schumann's cancellation of that claim fairly gives rise to an inference that he recognized Baker would also present a significant obstacle to the patentability of dependent claim 6 of the ��278 application.	1.6591761098835234
	The user of Blum's handheld device first plugs it into a central computer in order to download patient data.	1.6587026794208701
	McKesson contends that the district court erred by failing to account for evidence of Schumann's good faith, namely, his two separate disclosures of the existence of the ��149 application to Examiner Trafton in the course of prosecuting the ��716 patent.	1.6273509741864847
	However, none of the references disclose the real time, interactive three node communication system of the present invention as claimed.	1.6215615285449014
	In addition to numerous other differences, none of the references teach the three node approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention.	1.6085251008282377
	As to the remainder of McKesson's arguments respecting the ��347 patent, we find them duplicative of arguments we have already rejected in the context of the Baker patent and Examiner Lev's rejections in the course of examining the �� 149 application.	1.5827991615923416
	Moreover, the court explained, "Schumann himself evidenced his realization of the strength of the Baker patent when he chose not to even attempt to overcome Examiner Lev's rejection based on Baker and cancelled the claims in the [��149] application that were rejected due to Baker".	1.56654867599097
	McKesson advances another assignment of clear error by contending that the district court, in concluding that Baker undermines Schumann's argument to Examiner Trafton on October 6, 1987, that "none of the references [either singularly or in combination] teach the three node approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention," J.A. at 366, misinterpreted Schumann's statement by focusing "solely on a comparison of the similarities of Baker and the ��716 claims and not their differences," Appellant's Br. at 60.	1.5550730263382868
	The Hawkins specification, which contemplates communication between a garage door opener and a remote control in one embodiment, leaves no doubt that the invention described therein is a two-node communication system consisting of a base station and a portable unit.	1.5335197914638174
	Although McKesson's argument might have some merit if Examiner Lev had cited one small section of a much larger work, citation to the eighteen-column Baker patent put Schumann on notice of the content of the whole document.	1.512178550889257

	As to the district court's finding of materiality with respect to Examiner Lev's rejection of claims 15 and 16 in the ��149 application on February 26, 1987, McKesson points to four differences between those claims and the claims of the ��716 patent which McKesson argues were ignored by the district court:	1.4498534403406056
	Baker also teaches the use of "unique codes for each subsystem and station within the subsystem".	1.4373878882229438
	Accordingly, the three-node communication system disclosed in Baker-consisting of portable handsets, one or more subsystem controllers, and a central controller-could be material quite apart from the disclosure of anything analogous to a programmable unique identifier limitation.	1.4295719120727344
	The court found additional evidence of deceptive intent in Schumann's admission at trial that he knew his duty to disclose material information continued for at least 22 months after he learned of the Baker patent, and yet Schumann did nothing to bring Baker to Examiner Trafton's attention.	1.3963038533967693
	See J.A. at 366 ("In addition to numerous other differences, none of the references teach the three node approach to communications as provided in the claimed invention". (emphasis added)).	1.3261011462587444
	MPEP �� 2004(18) (5th ed. rev.3, 1986). "	1.313300328223935
	The court first explained that intent was inferable because "Schumann was informed of the Baker patent's materiality by the PTO itself when Examiner Lev brought the patent to [Schumann's] attention, suggested cancellation of certain claims, and then rejected claims as obvious in light of Baker-including claim elements that were present in the ['278] application".	1.2939673544734538
	the base stations which are wired to the main computer.	1.2723720381847543
	Thus, the court concluded that "while Mr. Schumann's disclosure of the co-pendency of the [��149 application] to Examiner Trafton is some evidence of a lack of intent to deceive under Akron Polymer, weighing all the evidence here, as the court must, said disclosure does not overcome the inference of an intent to deceive established [on these facts]." Findings and Conclusions, slip op.	1.2704345404375523
	The court buttressed its materiality conclusion with the further observation that the Baker patent also includes three-node communication-the very type of communication Schumann used to differentiate the claims of the ��716 patent from the prior art.	1.269398072599374
	In any event, a comparison of the rejected claims to the ��716 claims reveals that both sets of claims relate to the use of three-node communication and a unique address in the context of bar code reading.	1.2226206995321716
	The portable handheld terminal system of claims 15-16 [1] lacks a first and second bar code identifier means, [2] lacks the base station limitations of a programmable unique identifier, a means for allowing communication with a portable terminal having a corresponding unique identifier and a means for programming the portable terminal with the unique identifier, [3] lacks any patient identification or verification limitations, and [4] lacks any means for an alarm signal if the patient-item verification does not correspond.	1.2090951217349286
	Moreover, according to McKesson, "Hawkins is a better and more relevant reference with regard to the ��716 prosecution because Hawkins further teaches a programmable unique identifier for wireless communications between a portable terminal and base station, as claimed in the ��716," unlike Baker, which allegedly "does not teach that critical feature of programming".	1.2001528872438612
	A portable terminal, comprising: (a) a handheld housing; (b) keyboard means disposed on the housing for entry of data, said keyboard means including separate numeric and special function key means for user input to the terminal; (c) display means disposed on the housing for display of data; (d) optical sensor means interconnected to the housing for sensing bar code indicia on an object; (e) electromagnetic transceiver means in the housing for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals representing the exchange of data between the portable handheld terminal and a remote location while the portable handheld terminal is in use; (f) control means contained in the housing operatively interconnected to the keyboard means, display means, optical sensor means, and electromagnetic transceiver means for controlling operation of the portable handheld terminal; and (g) power supply means for powering the portable handheld terminal.	1.1857310876992189
	Importantly, however, the description of the preferred embodiment in Baker spans over eleven columns and provides a highly technical discussion of the implementation of the three-node communication system with unique addressing, whereas the same description in Pejas is just under two columns and provides only cursory implementation details.	1.1813117167104836
	McKesson also argues that Schumann's cancellation of these claims in the face of Examiner Lev's rejection is not evidence of materiality because such cancellation is "a legitimate and acceptable practice to obtain an early issuance of a patent," and because Schumann "explicitly stated that he was not acquiescing in the rejection but reserving the right to bring the claims in a further application".	1.176168900632677
	On October 6, 1987, claim 1 was submitted in substantially this form-except that the "programmable unique identifier" limitation was separated as a limitation in dependent claim 6-as part of parent Application No. 06/862,278 ("the ��278 application") (subsequently abandoned) in response to an April 6, 1987, rejection by Examiner David Trafton of the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO").	1.1372992276288327
	The court further rejected Schumann's explanation as "strain[ing] credulity" in light of the sequence of events surrounding the Baker patent: (1) Examiner Lev located the Baker patent on his own; (2) he brought it to Mr. Schumann's attention in a telephone interview; (3) he suggested the cancellation of certain ��009 claims, and then issued a rejection of those claims based in part on Baker; (4) shortly thereafter, Mr. Schumann found that the rejection based on Baker could not be overcome, requiring him to cancel the claims (regarding a handheld patient terminal system communicating wirelessly with base stations and via wires with a remote central computer) in order to continue with the ��009 prosecution; (5) finally, even though Mr. Schumann had disclosed the same prior art in both the ��009 and ��716 prosecutions through that point in time, he concluded that the Baker patent had no bearing on the �� 716 prosecution (which involved the same three-node wireless system rejected in the ��009 prosecution).	1.1283744529318174
	In particular, the court found by clear and convincing evidence that, in the course of prosecuting the ��716 patent, Schumann's failures to disclose (1) the existence of the Baker patent, (2) Examiner Lev's rejections of the initially broad claims in the ��149 application (which issued as the ��009 patent), and (3) the allowance of claims in the ��372 patent were material omissions done with an intent to deceive.	1.1270703081414208
	Therefore, McKesson contends, "Baker's disclosure of a unique address code was merely cumulative to Hawkins".	1.08888962062684
	However, aside from Hawkins (in combination with Blum), the only two such systems specifically pointed to by McKesson are U.S. Patent No. 4,588,881 ("the ��881 patent") to Pejas, and U.S. Patent No. 4,180,204 ("the ��204 patent") to Koenig.	1.0815132800368046

	As to Schumann's failure to disclose Examiner Lev's rejections of the claims in the ��149 application, the court began its analysis by rejecting McKesson's argument that our decision in Dayco Products, Inc. v. Total Containment, Inc., 329 F.3d 1358, 1367 (Fed.Cir.2003), "created a new disclosure requirement that [did] not apply to Mr. Schumann's prosecution of the ��716 patent in the 1980s".	1.0074267449045948
	With respect to Schumann's failure to notify Examiner Trafton of the allowance of the ��372 patent claims, McKesson contends that the district court erred in its materiality analysis by failing to determine whether the differences between the allowed claims of the ��372 patent and the claims of the ��716 patent are "so inconsequential [that] there was a substantial likelihood a reasonable examiner would have issued a double patenting rejection".	0.9987543870110711

	However, the court found this explanation incredible both because it would have been unreasonable, in the court's opinion, to conclude that Baker is cumulative, and because no contemporaneous evidence (e.g., notes, records, files, etc.) was adduced at trial to show that Schumann actually analyzed Baker and arrived at such a conclusion.	0.2456563200371574

	The ��716 patent provides "a patient identification system for relating items with patients and ensuring that an identified item corresponds to an identified patient".	0.15499409499536151
	This argument is untenable in light of not only the facts of Dayco itself-where we applied this "new" law to patents claiming a priority date of 1989, see 329 F.3d at 1360-but also the then-current Fifth Edition of the MPEP, which explains the breadth of "information" as used in 37 C.F.R. �� 1.56(a):	0.14828448121792367
	First, McKesson argues, "the device disclosed to the FDA included a more relevant feature than any art of record in the patent-in-issue," whereas in this case "the features disclosed in Baker were already present in the art of record".	0.14413638646590113
	The district court rejected this argument by distinguishing Akron Polymer on its facts and by explaining that section 2001.06(b) of the Manual of Patent Examination and Procedure ("MPEP") as well as our decision in Li Second Family LP v. Toshiba Corp., 231 F.3d 1373, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2000), "plainly impose[ ] a duty of disclosure beyond citation of the co-pending application".	0.14327134254602308

	Indeed, in the same way that prior art need not be substantially similar in order to be material (e.g., the telephone system of Baker, though not substantially similar to the ��716 claims, is nevertheless material), rejected claims in a co-pending application also need not be substantially similar in order to be material.	0.13109540148922028

	The court further noted that we found substantial similarity in Dayco among claims that "were in some respects substantially identical".	0.12459238064785653
	Regarding intent, Schumann's testimony at trial, according to the court, was that although he did not recall prosecuting the ��278 application, he explained that "he probably did not believe activity in the [��149] application was material to the ��716 prosecution because the [��149] case involved only a terminal, while the ��716 involved an entire 'system.'
