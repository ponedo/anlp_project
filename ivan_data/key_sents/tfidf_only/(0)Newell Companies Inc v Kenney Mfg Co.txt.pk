	It must also be noted again that the Patent Office did not cite the Corcoran shade as prior art and that Newell did not disclose either the Corcoran shade material or the advertising for the Corcoran shade to the examiner.	2.1030667632332642
	Ferguson, the inventor, was products manager of Newell's window shade division, and developed the shade after seeing certain vinyl shade material manufactured by Sean Corcoran.	2.000930947342135
	Kenney's engineer Paul Comeau agreed that the Ferguson shade was "a very different shade" than he had seen.	1.7807784425236295

	Corcoran sought a patent which claimed his shade material in combination with a roller, and in In re Corcoran, 640 F.2d 1331, 208 USPQ 867 (CCPA 1981), a predecessor of this court addressed the patentability of Corcoran's invention.	1.525741903447055
	Mr. Fallin, the President of Newell's window shade furnishings division, stated that Ferguson's shade was "about as new as you could get at that time":	1.4834960754260076
	Similarly, a shade could be made with a sufficient excess of shade material which when wrapped upon itself would provide the supporting tube overlying the telescoping inner end of the shade roller.	1.393420253268066
	Q. Did you foresee any impact in the cut-in-store shades, for example, by virtue of this do-it-yourself shade?	1.3538714749920493
	In conducting test marketing, Newell made shades from material supplied by Corcoran and from telescoping rollers available on the market and made by Clopay Corporation.	1.3411581810124669
	It particularly analyzed the United States patents to Gossling, No. 3,203,468 and No. 3,299,944, for window shades with adjustable, telescoping rollers.	1.33779115024581
	The court noted that the Corcoran material and shade design, which had not been considered by the PTO examiner, were prior art; also, that Corcoran contemplated using a roller which could be adjusted (albeit by cutting) to conform to the adjusted width of the shade material.	1.3083899192043356
	After learning of the Corcoran material in late 1973 or early 1974, Ferguson, sensing the market potential, contacted Corcoran, who resided in Ireland, and requested sample shades.	1.284424327713788
	A. I saw that, and probably still do, that the market for stock window shades will end up about fifty percent of what we call the cut window shades and fifty percent of what we call the adjustable window shades.	1.2737799348110113
	The Kenney shade was made with scored material and a telescoping roller but, unlike Ferguson's design, the shade material was attached to the larger roller section only and was simply allowed to wrap loosely around the smaller end.	1.2387934392899944
	Do you agree, Mr. Ferguson, with the statement that nothing could be more obvious than to mount Corcoran shade material on a roller adapted to be reduced in length? "	1.2161391903667018
	Witnesses explained to the jury that the Rice patent described a telescoping roller for use with standard (i.e. non-tearable) shade material, and that the Gossling '468 and Gossling '944 patents disclosed telescoping rollers to which a standard shade is affixed by various adhesive means.7	1.213545839588212
	Commercial Success and Long-Felt Need William Uecker, Senior Vice President for Kenney, testified that the market for window shades had been altered by this new shade, which he foresaw as taking half the window shade market:	1.2063448742596636
	There was substantial evidence of failure by others who were presumably of skill in the window shade art.	1.19067944932186
	Fallin testified about a device designed to enable cutting a shade at home.	1.161662450960471
	At trial, Kenney asserted numerous defenses, but the dispositive issue here is whether the '770 invention would have been obvious from prior art which includes the Corcoran material, telescoping rollers, and various means for securing a shade to a roller including adhesive strips and partial securement as in the Kenney shade.	1.1586674070129728
	Corcoran sent the shades along with a letter explaining that he would not have the output to supply Newell until 1975 and that at the time rollers were in better supply and cheaper in America.	1.1394470060455153
	Fallin testified concerning the immediate success of the do-it-yourself shade:	1.1257318132896
	The court noted that numerous prior patents showed telescoping rollers adjustable in width to which window shade material was attached.	1.1252729015471947
	Now do you agree, Mr. Donofrio, with the deposition testimony that was read in of Mr. Uecker, that Tom Ferguson's do it yourself without tools window shade was a significant step forward in the window shade art?	1.110430705744153
	The court noted that no single item of prior art specifically covered a shade using the improved Corcoran-type, scored, vinyl material on a telescoping roller.	1.1032555568350413
	Newell argues that the Gossling references teach away from a do-it-yourself adjustable shade which does not require use of tools because that art requires "cutting the shade material".	1.0825639564986407
	As to the support means we conclude that, given the plastic sheet shade material denominated a "window shade," nothing could be more obvious than to attach it to a roller or other support.	1.0817568444914372
	Because the Corcoran material had been placed on sale in the United States in 1972, more than a year before the filing date of Corcoran's application, and the combination with a roller would have been obvious, Corcoran was held to have lost his right to a patent under 35	1.0768234442814677
	Gossling '468 specifically teaches using the telescoping roller without the sleeve on the small roller section:	1.0752327181503232
	What was known in the field of window shade manufacture and design at the time the invention was made;	1.055711546447973
	In both, the shade material is adhesively secured directly to the larger roller section as in the claims, sub judice.	1.0462697284164908
	The jury was told of the close prior art; that the Corcoran scored shade material was prior art and was acknowledged in the specification; and that adjustable-width rollers were part of the prior art.	1.0080578346155995
	There was no evidence that others skilled in the art tried and failed to find a solution to the problems preventing in-home fitting of window shades once the Corcoran material was introduced.	1.0070335139180542
	The Clopay roller is the subject of United States Patent No. 3,203,468 (the '468 patent), issued to Gossling and owned by Clopay.	1.0061726085404215
	Q. Well, in light of that [total shade sales staying flat], can you explain why the sales of Mr. Ferguson's shade show an upward trend ... from 1975, about 30,000, to 4 & 1/2 million in 1983?	1.0019361319223166

	The basis for Kenney's argument is that Newell was guilty of inequitable conduct by failing to disclose Corcoran by name as the inventor of the vinyl fabric with invisible tear lines, Corcoran's advertisements in the United States for his shades, and Corcoran's correspondence with Ferguson, and in urging that a 1930 patent to Rice was the closest prior art.	0.9920552065969729

	In sum, the court concluded, however, that "given the nature of the [Corcoran] material, it would have been obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art to mount that shade material on a telescoping roller, well known in the art, which could be quickly shortened to match the width of the shade.	0.9259517350053842

	In July 1981, Kenney's do-it-yourself shade appeared in response to the requirements of its customer, K-Mart.	0.6857327483096513
	Ferguson proceeded to develop the subject matter of the '770 patent, which attaches the Corcoran material to a telescoping roller having a smaller section able to slide inside a larger section.	0.6844911253392381
	The district court stated: "Until the time of the claimed invention, store-cut shades were the state of the art".	0.6805717329814723
	A. Well, it has to be taking business from the cut in store shade because if the total units are fairly constant, and the Ferguson shade is increasing in numbers, the only place it could come from would be at the expense of the cut in store type product.	0.6697844196599626
	Do you agree, Mr. Ferguson, that you did not contribute the inventive thing which made the Newell shade a commercial success? "A No, I did not".	0.6631006676502983
	However, there was evidence that others of ordinary skill in the art had, prior to Ferguson's invention, proposed securing other, less satisfactory, strippable, shade material to telescoping rollers to achieve do-it-yourself adjustability without tools.12	0.6377626449039818
	The jury may have given weight to the undisputed fact that despite the availability of the Corcoran shade material and the other prior art, the accused infringer did not make this innovation, criticized its value, and then rushed to copy it.	0.6374566873555341
	Mr. Wright, Operations Manager for Kenney, stated that a reason Kenney entered the do-it-yourself-without-tools window shade market was because K-Mart had switched to that product.	0.6352113227423248
	Ferguson went even further and admitted the significance of the Corcoran material to the success of the invention in the following testimony: "	0.6174131787105038
	Indeed, the district court stated that the material was disclosed in the specification, without Corcoran's name.	0.6156431966414213

	There was testimony that the industry had long recognized the existence of significant problems with the way window shades were fitted, yet previous solutions failed for various reasons.	0.5612117612267137
	You must decide the issue of obviousness solely on the basis of what was known by a person with ordinary skill in the art of making window shades at the time of the invention.	0.5590390283853243
	Corcoran's material is scored partially through in lines parallel to one lengthwise edge so that it can be torn to a desired width.	0.5452558277418451
	As explained in the specification, the material is affixed to the larger roller section.	0.5384662427167445
	As described infra, the Clopay roller came with a cardboard sleeve which fitted over its smaller telescoping end.	0.5329289174164699
	After adjusting the width of the material and roller, the consumer removes a protective cover on an adhesive strip on the smaller roller end and presses the material onto that adhesive.	0.5325731820019467

	The speed with which this industry, that the district court described as "sluggish", moved to copy the Ferguson shade, when its commercial value became apparent, may have been significant to the jury.	0.4834736221908508
	Once Corcoran invented his plastic tearable material and publicly disclosed it, however, the problem of having to cut the material was eliminated.	0.4757742089452506

	In this case, as well, although the record shows a highly successful product,16 the record also establishes such a strong case of obviousness based on admissions and the teachings of the prior art, including the improved Corcoran tearable shade material, a reference not considered during examination, that the objective evidence of nonobviousness does not persuade us to reach a contrary conclusion.	0.4103911608981806
