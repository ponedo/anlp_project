	Drospirenone is also acid-sensitive.	9.244272288467853
	Barr argued that the Krause series on spirorenone is controlling because of the great similarity between spirorenone and drospirenone.	7.409508989506738
	Drospirenone was known in the art at all times relevant.	7.140407282232974
	He found that after 10 minutes, 21% of the drospirenone had isomerized in the acid, and after 45 minutes, half had isomerized.	7.103670680093309
	Tack then moved into clinical studies with an enteric-coated formulation of drospirenone.	6.717221391609112
	Dr. Johannes Tack, a Bayer scientist, began work in 1983 to develop drospirenone into an oral contraceptive.	6.430500427588195
	When consumed, spirorenone metabolizes into drospirenone, which is still a diuretic, but was found to have progestogenic (contraceptive) effects.	6.410496881236208
	Furthermore, an in vitro comparison found that drospirenone isomerized in pH 1 acid with a profile similar to spirorenone.	6.059389669118037
	Each of the invalidated claims requires drospirenone as the active ingredient.	6.000424150716271
	Bayer argues now that the district court ignored key differences between drospirenone and spirorenone, such as that the former isomerizes 40% faster than the latter, and that drospirenone is more soluble and thus could dissolve and isomerize in acid faster.	5.71522316292679
	He would be led to believe that drospirenone, like spirorenone, may absorb in vivo, but isomerize in vitro.	5.671752056166825
	Bayer decided to harness the diuretic effect of isolated drospirenone to create the new contraceptive.	5.442712061167076
	Drospirenone is also a poorly water soluble hydrophobic composition.	5.42903283024959
	These studies, Krause I, II, and III, included the knowledge that drospirenone was a metabolite of spirorenone.	5.404148454230081
	Because the use of drospirenone with 17a-ethinylestradiol as an oral contraceptive was known prior art, Bayer represented that the innovation was to micronize the drospirenone to increase its bioavailability, and that the micronized drospirenone would absorb with a normal pill, against the teachings of the prior art.	5.332237282898589
	Poor bioavailability of drospirenone is the major problem that Tack sought to solve.	5.303128799397917
	One of the active ingredients in Yasmin, drospirenone, is a progestin that inhibits ovulation.	5.182538335516946
	Bayer claimed that its innovation was that the drospirenone could be micronized to increase its bioavailability, and that the micronized drospirenone would not need to be enteric coated for protection against the highly acidic gastric environment.	5.173867934029038
	The planned studies on the progestogenic efficacy of [drospirenone] should therefore be performed with an enteric-coated formulation.	5.05282863304976
	The Court of Appeals, Mayer, Circuit Judge, held that innovation to micronize drospirenone to increase its bioavailability, and that micronized drospirenone would absorb with normal pill, was obvious.	5.001740806174946
	The examiner allowed the claims, giving the specific reason that the prior art suggested that micronizing drospirenone would not work: "The micronized drospirenone will be degraded even more rapidly because the micronization of drospirenone expose [sic] the drug particles in the stomach (acidic).	4.935440683628512
	Spirorenone itself had some contraceptive effects that Bayer concluded were the result of the appearance of drospirenone when it metabolized.	4.784325917543147
	Tack tested the stability of drospirenone in acid at pH 1 to simulate the conditions of the stomach.	4.698632148550741
	Barr attacked the merits of the study as it would apply to the practice of drospirenone in vivo, noting that Nickisch did not test drospirenone in vivo to correlate its in vitro findings.	4.672989291216189
	Tack decided, however, that these in vivo studies garnered little information on the practice of drospirenone in vivo.	4.044972369349513
	It can be used to show that a drug formulator having ordinary skill had a viable known option to consider with micronized, unprotected drospirenone, and a reasonable expectation that drospirenone would perform similarly (even if not identically) to the spirorenone in the Krause series.	3.9288358341311493
	Tack consulted prior Bayer work with drospirenone including in vitro isomerization studies performed by a fellow Bayer scientist, Dr. Werner Krause.	3.6586318343856084
	Following this study, Bayer developed drospirenone in a normal pill, for which it would eventually receive the ï¿½ï¿½531 patent.	3.622530866892843
	For five years, Bayer used this coated pill in its studies, even reconfirming in 1988 that drospirenone needed an enteric coating because it isomerized quickly in a pH 1 acidic solution.	3.6204517982553206
	Because the selection of micronized drospirenone in a normal pill led to the result anticipated by the Krause series, the invention would have been obvious.	3.6021758660867365
	Similarly, Bayer argued that the Nickisch article teaches that drospirenone isomerizes when exposed to acid in vitro, teaching away from allowing exposure to the gastric environment, and thus suggesting the need for an enteric coating.	3.5266353814447733
	At this point, a person having ordinary skill in the art has reached a crossroads where he must choose between two known options: delivery of micronized drospirenone by a normal pill following the spirorenone analogy in the Krause series, or delivery of drospirenone by an enteric-coated pill following the Nickisch teaching that the drug needs to be protected from the stomach.	3.508781886210416
	The evidence showed, without contradiction, that it was known that micronized drospirenone rapidly degraded at the acidity of stomach acid.	3.4821415851036033
	It also found that while the Nickisch reference did teach that drospirenone isomerizes in vitro when exposed to acid simulating the human stomach, a person of ordinary skill would be aware of the study's shortcomings, and would verify whether drospirenone absorbed or isomerized with precise in vivo and in vitro testing as suggested by the Robert Aulton treatise, Pharmaceutrics:	3.453528587374594
	The Bayer scientists believed that the way of avoiding the known acid degradation of drospirenone was to protect it from acid.	3.4273812551179375
	The studies each found no spirorenone isomers in the subjects' blood streams, and concluded that spirorenone is absorbed before it isomerizes.	3.393540105524797
	Previously known oral contraceptives such as progesterone and spironolactone are not acid sensitive, and drospirenone presented a highly specific challenge to the formulation scientists.	3.390568015509488
	When exposed to low-pH (highly acidic) environments such as found in the human stomach, drospirenone "isomerizes"-that is, the acid catalyzes a reaction that rearranges drospirenone's molecular structure while its molecular composition remains constant.	3.3677964144619166
	Nothing in the prior art teaches the likelihood of success of ingestion of uncoated micronized drospirenone; what is taught is the likelihood of failure.	3.3450505967281385
	The court found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that Nickisch establishes that drospirenone isomerizes in vitro, but would be alerted to the study's shortcomings when used in vivo.	3.205867262675364
	A drug that isomerizes when exposed to acid thus may isomerize at a faster rate if it is micronized.	3.204672628235827
	1727, 167 L.Ed.2d 705 (2007), it would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in pharmaceutical formulation to try a normal pill in formulating drospirenone as an oral contraceptive.	3.162935219466634
¡°	However, he found that despite his observations that drospirenone would quickly isomerize in a highly acidic environment and his belief therefore that an enteric coating would be necessary to preserve bioavailability, the normal pill and the enteric-coated pill resulted in the same bioavailability.	3.1289464425165585
	The district court analyzed the prior art and determined that micronizing drospirenone was taught, and that using a normal pill would have been obvious to try.	3.0867259003657668
	Bayer relied on the finding that drospirenone would absorb with a normal pill to overcome an obviousness rejection in the Patent and Trademark Office.	3.0751066668451017
	Barr also challenged the Nickisch reference on the grounds that drospirenone was found to isomerize slowly and would not have isomerized before the stomach emptied, that the in vitro environment was too extreme to be compared to an in vivo practice, and that it did not explain its testing protocols.	3.048014094388523
	There was no evidence to reasonably suggest that micronized drospirenone was likely to be usable, with 99+ percent consistency of effectiveness, without any protection from degradation by stomach acid.	2.982482154498793
	It was undisputed that it was not reasonably expected that uncoated micronized drospirenone would be 99+% effective as an oral contraceptive when ingested into the acidic stomach, when it was known to degrade rapidly in acid.	2.8680987394126825
	At the time that the Bayer scientists were attempting to formulate drospirenone as an oral contraceptive, the textbook teaching was that micronizing acid-sensitive products would accelerate their acid-induced degradation.	2.8227110350546507
	In effect, while Bayer argued that prior art teaches away from using micronized drospirenone in a normal tablet, Barr argued that the prior art teaches away from using an enteric coating.	2.781030894359839
	The court found that a person having ordinary skill in the art would have considered the Krause I, II, and III studies' results that spirorenone though acid-sensitive would nevertheless absorb in vivo because drospirenone is closely related to spirorenone.	2.6936118010422443
	The unusual physiological behavior of drospirenone in the stomach was not known; this knowledge followed as scientific explanation; it did not precede the invention in suit.	2.6451552430447665
	What the parties have done, however, is present the options available to a pharmaceutical formulator having ordinary skill to solve the problem of acid-sensitive but hydrophobic drospirenone.	2.6173041852623395
	Bayer added what it terms a "non-routine" element to the study, by which it added an unprotected (normal) drospirenone tablet and compared its bioavailability to that of the enteric-coated formulation and the intravenous delivery.	2.5144942663293612
	With the existing knowledge that drospirenone is both hydrophobic and that it degrades rapidly in acid, and the existing knowledge that micronization, although useful to counteract a drug's hydrophobic properties, renders the drug even more susceptible to acid degradation, it was not shown that a person of ordinary skill in this field would have had a reasonable expectation of achieving complete contraceptive bioavailability and effectiveness with uncoated micronized drospirenone.	2.4508357743799274
	Bayer responded that another piece of prior art, the Nickisch reference, taught that micronizing drospirenone would increase its exposure to the highly acidic environment in the stomach, which would result in increased isomerization.	2.4207129995701977
	The court then concluded that a person of ordinary skill would find the drugs closely related, and would therefore access these studies when formulating drospirenone.	2.2805517359524243
	However, enteric coatings are not without drawbacks themselves.	2.2414400244322734
	At the time, Bayer had been working with a related compound, spirorenone, as a diuretic.	2.2071292921540975
	The resulting isomer is non-antimineralocorticoidal, meaning it will not act as a diuretic, removing the desirable anti-bloating effect that sets drospirenone apart from other prior art progestins.	2.1610029679255978
	It found that Aulton recognizes the necessity of an enteric coating to the formulation of acid-sensitive drugs, but that an enteric coating also introduces drawbacks, including that enteric coated tablets have the lowest bioavailability of all drug delivery forms.	2.131669160526356
	It found that Aulton cut both ways on this point, because it taught both that micronizing a poorly water soluble substance like drospirenone may increase its absorption rate, but may also increase the rate of degradation.	2.1014480324620677
	The court considered Bayer's argument that prior art taught formulation scientists to employ an enteric coating on drospirenone, and Barr's argument that an enteric coating is so complicated, expensive, cumbersome to manufacture, and prone to variability that it only would be used as a last resort by formulation scientists working with an acid-sensitive drug.	2.063611400496159
	Tack expected to find that the enteric-coated tablet would produce a lower bioavailability than an intravenous injection, while the normal pill would produce an even lower bioavailability than the enteric-coated tablet.	1.9995571679737891
	Krause had also performed in vivo studies with spirorenone, about which he published three articles.	1.9583518865032867
	Therefore, scientists working with drospirenone for use in an oral contraceptive must be aware of and work around the effects that the human stomach will have on the drug to ensure that its "bioavailability"-the amount of the active drug absorbed into the bloodstream and available to act on the body-is high enough to perform its contraceptive function.	1.8631414524246137
	The district court acknowledged that the prior art suggested that there would be concern about the dissolution of a poorly water soluble acid-sensitive drug, but found that the prior art generally suggests that micronization could improve the dissolution of drospirenone.	1.8452576051739873
	Therefore, to formulate an oral dosage forms [sic] containing the drospirenone particles, which exposed to the gastric environment upon dissolution, would be unobvious in view of the data presented...." The ï¿½ï¿½531 patent issued on September 7, 2004.	1.7842200085644953
	If the results obtained in vitro are applied to in vivo conditions, it can be presumed that, with an assumed gastric juice volume of 100ml, the majority of the dose (solubility of drospirenone 5-10 mg/l) passes into solution during passage through the stomach and consequently undergoes rapid isomerization.	1.7197579585906877
	With all respect to my colleagues, I do not share their view that it would have been obvious to do that which was indisputably unobvious to the experienced formulation scientists whose assignment was to formulate the known product drospirenone.	1.6880077860866656
	At trial, the two parties agreed that 2-4 mg drospirenone was well known in the art, as well as its combination with 0.01-0.05 mg 17a-ethinylestradiol, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and a kit containing 21 such tablets with active ingredients and 7 placebos, to be used as an effective oral contraceptive in human females.	1.6296787414981777
	A pharmaceutical composition comprising from about 2 mg to about 4 mg of micronized drospirenone particles, about 0.01 mg to about 0.05 mg of 17.alpha.-ethinylestradiol, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, the composition being in an oral dose form exposed to the gastric environment upon dissolution, and the composition being effective for oral contraception in a human female.	1.5858518335237775
	Bayer is a large pharmaceutical company that produces the daily oral contraceptive, Yasmin THE-R.	1.5363553706656015
	The court reviewed the Hargrove reference, which was a study on micronizing progesterone, concluding that "it confirms that not all acid-sensitive drugs require enteric coating".	1.5229383978363933
	Coated tablets including enteric coated tablets present an obstacle to absorption, and thus reduce the drug's exhibited bioavailability.	1.4796859274472138
	All commercially available oral contraceptives use micronized progestins and/or estrogens, so this technique was well known in the art.	1.4137146775295606
	The Krause series tested the bioavailability of spirorenone in vivo in humans and monkeys to determine whether there was need to develop a "pharmaceutical formulation resistant to gastric juice".	1.4032013062258302
	The evidence showed, without contradiction, that the Bayer scientists working in this field believed that the product required an enteric coating in order to prevent degradation in the stomach, upon ingestion as an oral contraceptive.	1.3477794135362642
	See, e.g., Aulton's Pharmaceutics: The Design and Manufacture of Medicines (advising against micronizing acid-sensitive drugs because it reduces the drug's bioavailability).	1.293089525750187
	It relied principally on Robert Aulton's pharmacologist textbook, Pharmaceutics:	1.2843585534696484
	The district court further found that Aulton teaches that there is variability in bioavailability both intra- and inter-subject when using enteric coated tablets, which is a significant obstacle to Bayer's requirement that the drug must be 99% effective for all women.	1.281019248533778
	Its contraceptive qualities are particularly well suited for producing an oral contraceptive because, in addition to inhibiting ovulation, it is a diuretic which will diminish excess water retention arising from the estrogen component of oral contraceptives, and has anti-acne qualities to promote clear skin.	1.2644232261061632
	A usable contraceptive requires virtually complete effectiveness, and the standard confronting the Bayer scientists was high.	1.1626111448276424
	Once such a relationship has been established, in vitro dissolution tests can be used as a quality control test. (Aulton, p. 9)."	1.1228835568847775
	An enteric coating is a pH-sensitive film that protects the drug from stomach acid, and only releases the drug when it has passed into the less acidic duodenum and small intestine.	1.1200736082081364
	One method pharmaceutical companies use to surmount an acid-sensitivity problem with a drug to be taken orally is to deliver the drug via an enteric-coated pill, as opposed to an immediate release pill, also called a "normal pill".	1.0929887247134085
	Unlike the unrelated drugs cited by the panel majority, contraceptives require complete effectiveness.	1.072045682410185
	In 1988, Bayer also planned a study to determine how effectively its enteric-coated tablet delivered a formulation as compared to an intravenous injection of the same formulation.	1.048736894521527
	Additionally, the prior art was not vague in pointing toward a general approach or area of exploration, but rather guided the formulator precisely to the use of either a normal pill or an enteric-coated pill, thus avoiding the second pitfall of O'Farrell.	0.9709971931376562
	With that knowledge, the court then turned to micronization.	0.9458400447568096
	While micronizing a poorly water soluble composition may result in increased bioavailability, micronizing an acid-sensitive composition may also increase its sensitivity to the acid.	0.9371818220262987
	The district court then moved to Bayer's second alleged non-obvious aspect of the invention, whether the formulation should use an enteric-coated or normal tablet delivery.	0.9369810594399889
	So there remains adequate support for the conclusion that micronization was a viable option.	0.7737036659379719
	The evidence in this case is a better measure of obviousness than is the hindsight science of judges, for the scientists who eventually made this discovery testified, without dispute, that they did not believe an uncoated micronized product would meet the demanding criteria of contraceptive effectiveness.	0.7022779065449151
	This is irrelevant because the Krause series prior art is not an anticipatory reference.	0.6962371648014554
	The Science of Dosage Form Design (1988).	0.683044363476776
	However, Aulton stated, and other evidence corroborated, that "it is now generally recognized that poorly soluble drugs showing a dissolution rate limiting step in the absorption process will be more readily bioavailable when administered in a finely subdivided [micronized] form with larger surfaces than as the coarse material....	0.6795964696140235
	These desirable qualities have led to Yasmin's success.	0.679540938000837
	This is incorrect, as Barr agrees, because progesterone is not an acid-sensitive drug.	0.657344149752108
	The court found neither side persuasive, and considered the prior art as the center, again focusing on the Aulton textbook.	0.64593339740138
	However, in vitro tests only have significance if they can be related to in vivo results.	0.6387734581670559
	During prosecution, the examiner rejected the claims as obvious in view of a De Castro reference, which the examiner said taught to micronize poorly soluble drugs to increase their bioavailability.	0.5740172701943344
	A normal pill may not present such variations, but will expose its contents to the stomach's highly acidic environment.	0.5612996303588683
	The district court stated that micronization was a "viable" option, and that although success was "uncertain," the invention was obvious to try.	0.46240944070950474
	The fine material often in micronized form with larger specific surface dissolves at faster rates which can lead to improved drug absorption by passive diffusion".	0.4471620925446732
	However, Bayer's own expert, Dr. James McGinity, testified that micronization is the first choice solution because it presents the best chance for success.	0.42857665619723156
	The Science of Dosage Form Design, which, as the court found, teaches that "dissolution rate data when combined with solubility ... provide an insight to the formulator into the potential in vivo absorption characteristics of a drug.	0.3902252079921342
	The court concluded that the person of ordinary skill would not accept in vitro testing as valid without a correlation to in vivo tests.	0.3868428263577007
	Bayer argues that this is clear error because the court relied on one piece of prior art to show that micronization has been shown to work on acid-sensitive compounds.	0.3761475983584424
	The court first determined how the person having ordinary skill in the art of pharmaceutical formulation would consider the correlation of in vitro and in vivo tests.	0.3720415896542538
	Indeed, Bayer's expert testified at trial that this would be his first choice in attempting to increase the dissolution rate because, among the different ways to increase the dissolution rate, micronization presents the best chance of success.	0.3497547454015816
	With more of the drug dissolved, the drug will exhibit a higher bioavailability.	0.34140914392716937
	To combat this, pharmaceutical producers commonly employ a technique called "micronization," whereby the drug's particle size is reduced, increasing its overall surface area.	0.32986734815566954
	Bayer scientists noticed these intra-and inter-individual bioavailability differences in practice in their studies on beagles and women.	0.31141070314146885
	Because it will not easily dissolve into a volume of liquid, its bioavailability is degraded.	0.3065503999219168
