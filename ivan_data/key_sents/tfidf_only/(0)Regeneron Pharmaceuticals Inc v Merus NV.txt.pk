	Kucherlapati teaches that the xenogeneic locus "will be placed in substantially the same position as the analogous host locus, so that any regulation associated with the position of the locus will be substantially the same for the xenogeneic locus".	8.855448660414604

	In this way, the xenogeneic locus will be placed substantially in the same region as the analogous host locus, so that any regulation associated with the position of the locus will be substantially the same for the xenogeneic immunoglobulin locus.	8.005167946881961
	In contrast, Kucherlapati states that "the xenogeneic locus will be placed substantially in the same region as the analogous host locus, so that any regulation associated with the position of the locus will be substantially the same for the xenogeneic locus".	7.981937694141865

	At most, Taki teaches targeted insertion of a single gene of mouse DNA at the immunoglobulin locus.	6.39940737343901
	That is, Jakobovits teaches a method for targeted insertion at an immunoglobulin locus.	6.365774859431548
	Kucherlapati teaches methods of producing transgenic animals in which the host endogenous immunoglobulin locus is "substituted by a portion of, or an entire, xenogeneic immunoglobulin locus, or may have a xenogeneic immunoglobulin locus inserted into a chromosome of the host cell and an inactivated endogenous immunoglobulin region".	6.205401720273129

	Zou is cumulative of at least Kucherlapati, as well as Jakobovits who teaches the same Cre-loxP-mediated targeting of the immunoglobulin locus as utilized by both Zou and the '018 patent.5 Jakobovits, col. 1, ll.	5.855706658275789

	Bruggemann further expands that in doing so, "much of the DNA of the mouse	5.6071000675450655
	In particular, Dr. Smeland argued that Lonberg did not teach inserting "human unrearranged variable region gene segments" in the mouse immunoglobulin ("Ig") locus.	5.578744461410413
	The district court found that Zou, along with Taki, taught a "method" for inserting human unrearranged variable region gene segments into an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus.	5.409251748569334
	Because Bruggemann teaches targeted gene replacement as compared to Kucherlapati's non-enabled wholesale replacement, Bruggemann teaches a known technique to target the Ig locus, nowhere found in Kucherlapati.	5.4080044491080175
	The district court found that Taki taught "the motivation to target human variable region DNA into the mouse Ig locus".	5.260236184021843
	Further, Lonberg teaches targeting a mouse	5.254250774106716
	The district court found Zou to be but-for material because it "provides significant motivation to target the mouse Ig locus with human Ig DNA".	5.1769817620471805
	Regeneron only contests Bruggemann's materiality because Bruggemann purportedly does not disclose a reverse-chimeric mouse.	5.138914271796143
	Although Regeneron argues that Bruggemann is cumulative of Kucherlapati, we disagree.	5.064768151998243
	The district court found that Kucherlapati and Bruggemann were not cumulative, stating:	5.0645935757239595
	As the district court correctly found, Taki teaches targeting at the specific locus-the Ig locus-with operable linkage ... taking advantage of the mouse regulatory and constant regions.	5.0643236765661275
	Bruggemann's statement of "unrealized ambitions" of targeted replacement of the immunoglobulin locus does not impart invalidating materiality when the ambitions are accomplished by Regeneron.	5.003925299540539
	There is no dispute that the PTO considered both Lonberg and Kucherlapati during prosecution.	5.002092106603358
	Taki is a 1993 article describing the then-knowledge of targeted insertion of a rearranged murine variable region construct at the immunoglobulin locus.	4.993706538312299
	I note that this application was recently allowed over both Kucherlapati and Taki.	4.944165445204596
	Zou and Jakobovits use the same method of targeted insertion; Zou is not alleged to teach a missing limitation, but only to provide a "motivation" to target the immunoglobulin locus.	4.910729971481471
	Taki, which teaches inserting "rearranged mouse variable region [DNA] into the Ig locus" to produce a transgenic mouse with good B-cell development and antibodies, would not.	4.902691609065041
	As Merus's expert Dr. Geoff Davis explained, however, Wood does disclose specific targeting of the mouse's Ig locus.	4.855131616198201
	Regeneron also argues that Bruggemann, Wood, and Taki are cumulative of references that the examiner considered during prosecution of the '018 patent.4 In particular, Regeneron contends that Bruggemann is cumulative of U.S. Patent No. 6,114,598 issued to Raju Kucherlapati et al. on June 5, 1995 ("Kucherlapati"), Wood is cumulative of Lonberg, and Taki is cumulative of Kucherlapati and Lonberg.	4.638444517803923
	Skilled artisans are therefore taught to specifically target the endogenous Ig locus when inserting human DNA into the mouse.	4.595341947004036
	As Dr. Smeland stated to the PTO during prosecution, "Lonberg does not disclose a mouse comprising in its germline human unrearranged variable region gene segments inserted at a mouse immunoglobulin locus.	4.554347154281626
	Bruggemann Bruggemann is a 1996 review paper that collects the then-published methods of integrating immunoglobulin transgenes into murine genomes.	4.470184089238804
	The district court recognized that Taki "provides different motivations" than Kucherlapati.	4.327430955139528
	The claim simply recites a genetically modified mouse that comprises "human unrearranged variable region gene segments inserted at an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus".	4.314846048892381
	Ig locus, preserving part of the mouse constant region, and discloses producing antibodies at the "same level and efficiency as wild-type mice".	4.276543763234797
	The panel majority's statement that Zou is described as a method to retain and exploit regulatory sequences is a misreading of both Zou and Bruggemann.	4.103662704868521
	In particular, Bruggemann teaches that "an attractive alternative [to the random integration of human genes into mouse genes] would be to replace the mouse Ig loci with the human Ig loci".	4.042477729309967
	As noted above, claim 1 recites "a genetically modified mouse, comprising in its germline human unrearranged variable region gene segments inserted at an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus".	4.042105104325616
	J.A. 2193 (Dr. Jones's deposition transcript) ("Kucherlapati is primarily focused on adding the fully human transgene randomly in the genome and then inactivating the endogenous locus".).	4.033358040585294
	Under that method, human variable and human constant region gene segments are randomly integrated into the mouse genome, while the mouse's own antibody genes are 'knocked out' by targeted deactivation of the mouse immunoglobulin locus".	3.8711355011174904
	Thus, Wood is not cumulative of Lonberg.	3.7037130861552283
	While Regeneron's opening brief states, in a heading, that Zou is "cumulative of Kucherlapati and Lonberg," Regeneron provides no further argument regarding these references.	3.65283915862521
	As the district court correctly noted, Taki teaches insertion of exogenous (i.e., foreign) "rearranged mouse variable region [DNA] into the Ig locus" to produce a transgenic mouse with good B-cell development and antibodies.	3.6484718592248986
	In contrast, Regeneron represented both during prosecution of a related application and in litigation that Kucherlapati's discussion of a "xenogeneic locus" is not enabled and concerns wholesale replacement.	3.622064542588715
	The fact that Taki teaches using exogenous mouse DNA instead of exogenous human DNA does not detract from the motivation Taki provides to target the mouse	3.5948412562881735
	These transgenes are randomly integrated into the host (mouse) genome, id. at [0292], and the resulting animals are then crossed with "knockout" mice-i.e., mice with a disrupted immunoglobulin locus, id. at [0296].	3.5905463628014536
	As even Regeneron admits, Zou teaches specifically inserting human Ig DNA into the mouse	3.549463087534163
	Kucherlapati was thus presumed enabled before the examiner.	3.4613026774276343
	Ig loci" might be replaced with human DNA.	3.4547159512922065
	Lonberg was the examiner's primary reference, and teaches the introduction of immunoglobulin transgenes into mouse cells.	3.4121559898364837
	Zou does not add but-for material information to these references.	3.377516933476741
	Marianne Bruggemann & Michael S. Neuberger, "Strategies for Expressing Human Antibody Repertoires in Transgenic Mice," 17(8)	3.365043887342847
	The references, in particular Taki and Zou, also provide the motivation to combine these references to develop the genetically modified mouse.	3.329505324858683
	The district court found that Bruggemann taught (1) replacing "much of" the mouse Ig locus with human DNA; (2) an "explicit motivation" to exploit endogenous regulatory sequences; and (3) retaining an entirely human gene segment and an entirely murine gene segment.	3.3203088820316515
	Taki indeed mentions this long-sought ambition.	3.309699223452464
	The examiner in the "reasons for allowance" stated that "the prior art does not teach or suggest a genetically modified mouse comprising, in its germline cells, human unrearranged variable region gene segments inserted at an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus".	3.270644639136599
	Claim 1 of the '018 patent, the only claim at issue here, recites, in its entirety, "a genetically modified mouse, comprising in its germline human unrearranged variable region gene segments inserted at an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus". '018 patent col. 29 ll.	3.26504826972016
	The district court properly found that Zou's teaching of inserting portions of human constant, rather than variable, DNA did not detract from its motivation to insert human variable regions in the mouse Ig locus.	3.2294556150529177
	Bruggemann concludes with a statement of hope for future achievement:	3.1710898478832608
	Taki does not teach the LTVEC method or human unrearranged variable region gene segments in their germline configuration.	3.1642250279528414
	Taki reflects the early work in this field; it has been superseded by the teachings of Kucherlapati and the other cited references.	3.1618716683671932
	Wood's teaching of a "DNA construct" was misread as teaching the targeted insertion of that construct at a particular portion of the endogenous locus.	3.153638762296688
	In fact, as Merus's expert Dr. Davis noted, Bruggemann cited Zou for this precise disclosure a few years later.	3.1466557311956085
	Bruggemann is a review paper that teaches the use of transgenic mice to express human antibodies.	3.118904656726584
	Taki does not teach a mouse with unrearranged variable region DNA capable of recombination to create innumerable immune responses.	3.064890157001911
	According to Regeneron, Taki only teaches inserting rearranged variable region DNA from one mouse into the genome of another mouse.	3.0541407159292246
	In the statement of reasons for allowance, the Examiner stated that "the prior art does not teach or suggest a genetically modified mouse comprising, in its germline cells, human unrearranged variable region gene segments inserted at an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus".	3.0381887340744984
	Taki, in short, provides the motivation to target human variable region DNA into the mouse	3.037797099070175
	The rearranged gene inserted in the Taki reference, VH15, is derived from a murine antibody to phosphorylcholine.	3.0029696925602094
	In a January 2013 Reply to the Final Office Action, Regeneron amended claim 1 to include the additional limitation that the human unrearranged variable region gene segments would be inserted at "an endogenous" mouse immunoglobulin locus.	2.9953223342904147
	The only relevant expert testimony suggests that Jakobovits is not cumulative of Zou.	2.9598382218635066
	See Decision in Appeal No. T2220/14-3.3.08, at 67-68 (Taki)	2.9572900419214974
	The panel majority agrees, stating that the "fact that Taki teaches using exogenous mouse DNA instead of exogenous human DNA does not detract from the motivation Taki provides to target the mouse	2.917667842668877
	Wood further teaches that when human DNA is combined with mouse DNA, the "constant region," i.e., the constant region of the DNA in the Ig locus, "is of exogenous or endogenous species origin" and that this constant region may be "from the animal itself".	2.9124803837337123
	Bruggemann instructs to "retain and exploit any possible regulatory sequences in the mouse loci that are located distal to protein-coding regions," and cites Zou's method to accomplish this.	2.9112527165744764
	There is no support in Wood for the leap from a broad, unspecified disclosure of "integration" somewhere into the genome, to the district court's finding of disclosure of targeted insertion at the Ig locus.	2.9006905440037367
	ï¿½E "I firmly believed-and still believe today-that Bruggemann, Taki, Zou and Wood were not material to patentability because they were substantially different from the mice claimed in the '176 application ... and were cumulative of other information before the Patent Examiner".	2.8117284390740043
	In that early work, the Taki transgenic mouse produced fully murine antibodies to this particular antigen.	2.763364320918757
	As noted above, the references both individually and in combination teach one of skill in the art to genetically modify mice by inserting exogenous, including human, variable region gene segments endogenously into a mouse immunoglobulin locus.	2.754296671102272
	Zou discloses the insertion of human constant regions; the '018 Patent does not".	2.7427569229730095

	The examiner rejected all the claims of the '018 application as anticipated by Lonberg, and obvious over Lonberg in combination with three other references, including a Bruggemann reference dated four years after the allegedly withheld Bruggemann reference, discussed post.	2.6505245102603463

	The panel majority also incorrectly states that Bruggemann suggests the method of Zou to accomplish retaining and exploiting regulatory elements.	2.5919519269488385
	Instead, according to Dr. Smeland, Lonberg teaches genes that are "randomly inserted at (unknown) loci".	2.5848342006414726
	Regeneron had not developed any such mouse at the time.	2.570527054294885
	Regeneron contends that Zou only teaches modifying a mouse's constant region whereas the '018 patent teaches modifying a mouse's variable region.	2.54126613461552
	Regeneron also unpersuasively argues that Wood is cumulative of Lonberg.	2.540181994276783
	First, Regeneron argues that the district court improperly found Bruggemann to be but-for material.	2.5316937718727788
	The panel majority adopts different and flawed reasoning, finding that Bruggemann shows "targeted gene replacement" while Kucherlapati shows "wholesale replacement".	2.5142356417732654
	Merus, on the other hand, argues that under the broadest reasonable construction, claim 1 includes mice that can produce humanized, fully human, or reverse chimeric antibodies.2 As originally filed, claim 1 of the '176 application recited "a genetically modified mouse, comprising in its germline human unrearranged variable gene region segments inserted at a mouse immunoglobulin locus".	2.477549956086344
	According to Regeneron, "the '018 Patent discloses the insertion of human variable regions; Zou does not.	2.4593143734155096
	This discussion has no bearing on the status of Zou as but-for material prior art.	2.4179949703698362
	Under the district court's "broadest reasonable interpretation," the '018 claims require a genetically modified mouse, the genes of which have been modified using the particular large targeting vector method described in the specification, by the insertion of human variable region DNA in its germline configuration into or next to the endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus.	2.3797418794680905
	J.A. 2178-80 (Regeneron's Non-Final Office Action Response, U.S. Patent Application No. 13/719,819) ("One of ordinary skill in the art would not have a reasonable expectation of successfully using the YAC-based method described in Kucherlapati to generate the mice comprising the targeted insertion of human unrearranged variable region gene segments into the endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus, as currently claimed".);	2.3322131228418885
	These segments are "unrearranged" in that they are not "rearranged as to encode a functional immunoglobulin light or heavy chain," but are not in germline configuration.	2.3255285080284804
	The dissent, however, argues that Zou is cumulative of a different cited reference, Jakobovits.	2.305017855965826
	Neither the parties nor the district court argued or found that Zou is cumulative of Jakobovits.	2.3020844945961025
	Bruggemann does not teach unrearranged variable region gene segments in the germline configuration, nor does it teach any method-much less the LTVEC method required by the claims.	2.291985123412756
	The method of Zou is cited only as an example of the "successful replacement of small portions of the mouse genome," as opposed to a method to accomplish the "possibility" of inserting larger portions of the immunoglobulin loci.	2.269205440844857
	Wood does not describe any targeted insertion method described elsewhere in the prior art, such as Cre-loxP. The district court excuses this absence, because Wood "is appropriately understood as including but not limiting insertion at the Ig locus".	2.266255735715128
	As an example, Kucherlapati teaches retaining promoter and regulatory regions of the host DNA.	2.259447832998142
	The district court does not explain how this distinction converts Bruggemann into an invalidating reference.	2.2234626439184186
	According to Regeneron, Wood does not teach inserting a human variable gene into a mouse by targeting the mouse	2.2147954390436206
	Kucherlapati relates generally to "the production of xenogeneic specific binding proteins in a viable mammalian host".	2.208120003518191
	As Regeneron explains, Lonberg teaches using a " 'knockout plus transgene' method for genetically engineering mice.	2.203062774324484
	Claim 1, on the other hand, recites inserting unrearranged human variable region DNA into a mouse genome.	2.1759658565353353
	Third, Regeneron argues that the district court improperly found Taki to be but-for material.	2.164769007035423
	However, argument of Kucherlapati's enablement does not appear in the prosecution record of the '018 application. "	2.1640056986811107
	Both Regeneron and Merus agree that the claimed mouse has, as recited in claim 1, "human unrearranged variable region gene segments".	2.1320576610704087
	Fourth, Regeneron argues that the district court improperly found Zou to be but-for material.	2.115308850687856
	Thus, the district court properly concluded that Zou was also but-for material.	2.110562604625006
	The Merus opposition brief cited the references cited by the United States examiner, and additional references in this busy field of science, including the same Bruggeman, Taki, Zou, and Wood references.	2.089396907388636
	For example, mouse DNA can be manipulated to create chimeric antibodies that have mouse variable region DNA and human constant region DNA.	2.0871675387319866
	Kucherlapati, also cited by the examiner, teaches retaining promoter and regulatory regions of the host DNA.	2.0541343897845032
	Wood teaches the use of either constructed unrearranged gene fragments or the use of contiguous unrearranged human DNA.	2.034682987351903
	The claims of the '018 patent require human DNA, not mouse DNA or any exogenous DNA.	2.021455837990647
	The district court did not err by finding Taki's disclosure of targeting insertion of exogenous variable region DNA to be but-for material.	1.9531918885122563
	term "a genetically modified mouse, comprising in its germline human unrearranged variable region gene segments inserted at an endogenous mouse immunoglobulin locus" was not limited to a reverse chimeric mouse; prior international patent publication on chimeric and transgenic animals capable of producing human antibodies was but-for material; prior journal article on targeted insertion of a variable region gene into the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus was but-for material; prior journal article on cre-loxp-mediated gene replacement was but-for material; and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in drawing an adverse inference that patentee acted with a specific intent to deceive the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) when it withheld prior art references during patent prosecution.	1.9516195645706826
	Neither the district court nor the panel majority addresses the enormous difference between Taki's use of a single rearranged variable region gene and the unrearranged variable region gene segment in the '018 patent.	1.924439441738152
	Finally, mice can also be modified to create reverse chimeric antibodies that have mouse constant region DNA and human variable region DNA.	1.9230772735736958
	Wood teaches that "the animals of this invention are designed by the integration into their germlines of DNA carrying unrearranged or only partially rearranged exogenous Ig gene segments".	1.9087055538349196
	Wood Wood describes a transgenic mouse having unrearranged human DNA fragments incorporated into its germline.	1.8826633018378776
	The Wood teaching of "integration" into the genome is cumulative of Lonberg and other references which broadly teach "integration" into the genome.	1.8618079247281571
	During prosecution the examiner cited seven references, including U.S. Application 11/009,873 ("Lonberg") and U.S. Patent No. 6,114,598 ("Kucherlapati"), and considered U.S. Patent No. 6,130,364 ("Jakobovits").	1.832760781863556
	Similarly, mice can be used to create humanized antibodies that have some mouse variable region DNA, some human variable region DNA, and human constant region DNA.	1.8326057332739252
	Wood does not describe how such gene fragments are "introduced" or "integrated" into the germline of the described mouse; Wood does not teach targeted insertion.	1.8207594702410195
	According to Regeneron, because claim 1 only recites modifying the mouse by inserting "human unrearranged variable region gene segments," it implies leaving the remainder of the mouse's DNA unmodified.	1.8076240792978027
	The district court referred to Regeneron's arguments before the European Patent Office about whether Kucherlapati was enabled.	1.8066298522114153
	Smeland and Murphy's mental impressions of the Withheld References during prosecution of the '018 patent.	1.79773794460686
	Further, genetically modified mice can be used to create antibodies that have fully human DNA.	1.7634047137195727
	Smeland and Murphy knew of the Withheld References and did not disclose them to the PTO.	1.7517826045277485
	There was no dispute that Regeneron knew of the Withheld References during prosecution of the '018 patent.	1.7492428555941986
	With regards to Bruggemann and Zou, "I was generally familiar with the subject matter of those two references ... at no time did I consider these references to be material to patentability to the claims pending in the '176 application".	1.7317315830687459
	Zou teaches the targeted insertion of a human constant region gene segment, and uses the Cre-loxP system to "replace the mouse gene, Cï¿½^1, which encodes the constant region of the heavy chain of IgG1 antibodies, with its human counterpart".	1.7215663013325602
	The specification thus does not limit the claims to mice with human variable regions and mouse constant regions.	1.7202477469502584

	It is far from clear whether this [Ig loci replacement] will be the best way to create a mouse strain giving rise to a wide-range of high-affinity antibodies.	1.6641866963950507
	For example, Wood teaches that "the present invention relates generally to immunoglobulin rearrangement in chimeric and transgenic animals, and more specifically to a mouse containing in its germline ... the ability to generate immunoglobulins...." Wood at 1:4-9 (emphasis added); J.A. 2125-26.	1.6560145764686605
	An attractive alternative would be to replace the mouse	1.6435674564715623
	Lonberg relates generally to "transgenic non-human animals capable of producing heterologous antibodies...." Lonberg at ? 002.	1.6258058157430868
	Regeneron contends that this disclosure teaches targeted insertion of human DNA at the mouse	1.62062473288473
	In addition to arguing that the Withheld References are not but-for material individually, Regeneron also argues that the Withheld References are not but-for material in combination.	1.6159873563698202
	The district court ignored Bruggemann's statements that these results had not been achieved, as well as that these elements are not required by the claims.	1.6111783681703125
	Instead, Regeneron contends that Wood teaches "randomly integrating human transgenes" into a mouse genome with no such targeting.	1.5619328708103397
	Marianne Bruggeman & Michael S. Neuberger, "Strategies for Expressing Human Antibody Repertoires in Transgenic Mice," 17(8)	1.5381891483611858
	Merus, on the other hand, argues that the constant region of the gene segments in the claimed mouse may contain mouse genes or human genes, and may, therefore, be reverse chimeric, humanized, or fully human.	1.5111913875159784
	ï¿½E "I viewed the analysis [relating to the Withheld References] as straightforward".	1.5051307818275166
	The Jakobovits reference teaches the "use of Cre-mediated site-specific recombination for modifying immunoglobulin loci, for instance, to replace all or a part of either the constant region or variable region of an antibody molecule".	1.4972461269639827
	Jakobovits, col. 1, ll.	1.4904197777816641

	Jakobovits, col. 1, ll.	1.4904197777816641
	One practical use of this technology is that users may target and modify specific genes in mice so that the mice develop antibodies that can be used by humans.	1.473563149917957
	Bruggemann teaches the benefits of targeted insertion as taking advantage of the regulatory regions distal to the protein-coding regions and the expectation that mouse regulatory sequences distal to the protein coding regions will remain intact.	1.4598753651762
	Regeneron further argues that the specification purportedly limits the claim to mice that produce "hybrid antibodies containing human variable regions and mouse constant regions".	1.4453029025113027
	The district court found that Wood teaches the "insertion of human variable region gene segments upstream of an endogenous mouse constant region, to produce a genetically modified mouse" and "motivates a person of ordinary skill to use an endogenous mouse constant ï¿½g (mu) region for purposes of allelic exclusion".	1.395874078170675
	But Regeneron argues that under the broadest reasonable construction of claim 1, the non-variable (constant) region of the claimed mouse's modified gene segments exclusively contains mouse genes.	1.3957391611662398
	Lonberg specifically discloses "constructing" a transgene composed of at least one variable gene segment, one joining gene segment, and one constant region gene segment, preferably of human origin.	1.3849068624927603
	Following receipt of Dr. Smeland's Reply and presentation, the PTO issued an Advisory Action maintaining the rejection of claims 1-19 as anticipated by Lonberg, and claim 20 remained rejected in view of Lonberg and other references.	1.3677061933813746
	We therefore are not persuaded by the distinction drawn by Regeneron and conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding Bruggemann but-for material.	1.363690647019023
	The Lonberg transgene constructs may include regulatory sequences from either the host (i.e., murine) or a related animal, or from the exogenous (i.e., human) species.	1.3613145501870596
	The panel majority cites Regeneron's arguments about Kucherlapati's enablement in the prosecution of a different patent application, U.S. Application No.	1.3443501666872004
	In January 2012, the PTO issued a Non-Final Office Action rejecting claims 1-19 of the '176 application as being anticipated by a U.S. Application No. 11/009,873 to Nils Lonberg and Robert Kay ("Lonberg").	1.3200693191266786
	Merus contends that Regeneron's failure to disclose the Withheld References constituted inequitable conduct.	1.3184542419325125
	The result is that the cross-bred mice produce heterologous (i.e., non-host) antibodies.	1.3114377358724512
	As discussed above, however, claim 1 is not limited to reverse-chimeric mice.	1.3053779556641643
	In other words, Regeneron argues that claim 1 is limited to a reverse chimeric mouse.	1.3053725609113942
	One such antibody is illustrated below:	1.297198705825203
	He argued that unlike the recited claims of the '176 application, Lonberg teaches random and not targeted insertion.	1.2922601400688594
	Claim 1 encompasses humanized, fully human, and reverse chimeric mice as well.	1.29053107764988
	A germline that "comprises" human variable region gene segments may very well also include human constant gene segments.	1.2303695236170518
	Although the district court found that Jakobovits taught targeting only for the insertion of lox sites, that is incorrect, for Jakobovits refers to the "use of Cre-mediated site-specific recombination for modifying immunoglobulin loci, for instance, to replace all or a part of either the constant region or variable region of an antibody molecule".	1.1895293213880673
	Substantial evidence supports the district court's finding of but-for materiality of the Withheld References.	1.1858263191814156
	Although Regeneron did not disclose the Withheld References during prosecution of the '018 patent, once the '018 patent had been allowed, Regeneron disclosed the Withheld References to the PTO in every related application having the same specification and similar claims.	1.1673949103428969
	While such ambitions have not yet been realized, successful replacement of small portions of the mouse genome have been described.	1.1413606362765125
	Further, Regeneron's technical expert testified that Kucherlapati's prophetic description would disrupt "important aspects of lymphoid development" and would prevent normal B cell development.	1.1352951363102177
	Indeed, the district court's finding of materiality of Bruggemann is in conflict with the district court's rejection of Regeneron's arguments that the claims require retaining the murine constant region and require functional murine regulatory elements.	1.1281956379834324
	Wood, as explained above, teaches skilled artisans to specifically target the mouse	1.1249107225434627
	Wood teaches a "DNA fragment construct" with murine constant regions upstream from the human variable region gene segments.	1.104580505932176
	The district court referred in a footnote to Regeneron's internal email discussion of citation to Zou in preparing a scientific publication, and found these conversations "relevant" to materiality.	1.0930082419644453
	We conclude that the district court properly found that the Withheld References were but-for material and were not cumulative.	1.0925629847943388
	Thus, the "customary and ordinary" meaning of the language in claim 1 is not limited to a reverse chimeric mouse.	1.0454555928106963
	The development of a transgenic mouse with good B-cell development and antibodies is also an intended goal of the '018 patent. '018 patent col. 20 ll.	1.0314939505197986
	Accordingly, we disagree with Regeneron and conclude that under the broadest reasonable construction, the district court correctly found that the claims are not limited to mice that solely comprise mouse constant region gene segments.	1.0030534969691554
	This spectrum of modified antibodies is illustrated below.	0.9897630270486747

Instead, in its opinion following the first bench trial, the court exhaustively detailed Regeneron's discovery misconduct throughout litigation and sanctioned Regeneron by drawing an adverse inference of specific intent to deceive the PTO. In particular, the district court discussed Regeneron's repeated violations of the district court's discovery orders and improper secreting of relevant and non-privileged documents. Based on this misconduct, the district court drew an adverse inference that Regeneron's agents failed to disclose the Withheld References to the PTO with the specific intent to deceive the PTO. Having determined the but-for materiality of the Withheld References and drawn an adverse inference of Regeneron's specific intent to deceive the PTO, the district court concluded that Regeneron had committed inequitable conduct and held the '018 patent unenforceable. Regeneron timely appealed the district court's claim construction order and final judgment of inequitable conduct. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 1295(a)(1). The '018 patent emerged from a family of applications that originated in December 2000. In February 2001, Regeneron filed a continuation-in-part from that original application, which ultimately issued as U.S. Patent No. 6,596,541 ("'541 patent").	0.22248840702742004
