	The Tarka THE-R product is a combination of two hypertension medications, trandolapril and verapamil hydrochloride.	1.9988071231013724
	The trandolapril ACE inhibitor in the Tarka THE-R product is distinguished from the class of previously known ACE inhibitors in that trandolapril is a "double-ring" compound, whereas the prior art had studied primarily "single-ring" compounds.	1.515999692552868

	Glenmark argues that because the single-ring inhibitors had been tested in combination with calcium antagonists, it was "obvious to try" every combination of effective ACE inhibitor and calcium channel blocker.	1.134481673535946
	Glenmark argued at trial, and repeats on this appeal, that the Tarka THE-R product simply substituted one known ACE inhibitor for another.	1.1112588428683856

	This patent infringement suit concerns the antihypertension drug having the brand name Tarka THE-R.	0.9504297730656267
	The Plaintiffs stress that there was no prior knowledge that the combination of a double-ring ACE inhibitor with calcium antagonists would be longer lasting than the hypertension treatments at the time.	0.9322059633269763
	At trial Glenmark's expert agreed that quinapril and trandolapril are of the class of double-ring ACE inhibitors, and that neither of these double-ring compounds was suggested for use in combination with a calcium channel blocker in any prior art reference.	0.9214236503542957

	However, there was not disagreement that the previously tested combinations of ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers required more than once daily dosing, and that the longer-lasting effectiveness of the Tarka THE-R combination, along with its improved kidney and blood vessel function, were not provided by, or predicted or suggested by, the prior art.	0.7541050695991341

	The jury could reasonably have relied on the testimony of the Plaintiffs' expert, that persons skilled in the art in 1986 would not have predicted the longer-lasting hypertension control demonstrated by the double-ring structures of quinapril and trandolapril in combination with calcium antagonists, because of the widespread belief that double-ring inhibitors would not fit the pocket structure of the ACE.	0.7008003767754462

	The dosage requirements of these drugs were unchanged in prior art studies involving combinations with calcium channel blockers.	0.5471915236267342
	The Plaintiffs pointed out that nothing in the art suggested the combination of the double-ring trandolapril with verapamil hydrochloride, or suggested that this combination would provide the previously unavailable extended and improved efficacy.	0.5440435552928298
	This view was challenged by the testimony of Plaintiffs' expert, who testified that persons skilled in this field at the time of the patent generally believed that double-ring ACE inhibitors were not more effective than single-ring inhibitors to control hypertension because single-ring structures were believed to fill the "pocket" of the ACE enzyme to inhibit the enzyme's activity, and that the double-ring inhibitors would not fit in the pocket as effectively.	0.5432627775465504
