	The Germain Application 1.	32.74557896466285
	Germain application.	32.74058036095818
	a. Germain Application	21.83126092579533
	Narcisse further explained, "[The Germain application] was not material to the patentability of the ¡¬766 application....	16.895242054131216
	And so the Germain was not prior art to the ¡¬766, and therefore the Germain application didn't come into the picture at all".	16.372354992670477
	Meihao contends that Narcisse "copied" the claims from the Germain application into the application that matured into the ¡¬766 patent.	13.144758961078745
	Many of these questions were about the relationship between the Germain application and claim 1 of the ¡¬766 patent, or Narcisse's rationale for failing to disclose the Germain application to the PTO.	13.128900829625064
	at 7:24-29, 19:15-22, 22:25-33 ("[Narcisse's] testimony is that he did not believe [the Germain application] was material because ... it was not prior art...."), 60:24-59.	11.826748221097217
	First, Narcisse asserted that he did not disclose the Germain application because it was not prior art.	11.826512147030664
	Despite his intimate knowledge of the Germain application and his familiarity with double-patenting rejections, Narcisse did not disclose the Germain application to the PTO.	11.52762389025777
	During his deposition, Narcisse provided a plausible explanation for why he did not disclose the Germain application: "because the Germain application is not a prior art reference to the ¡¬766 application".	11.499663614446371
	Second, Narcisse claimed that he did not believe that 37 C.F.R. ¡± 1.604(b) required disclosure of the Germain application.	11.089349044971309
	Second, Leviton argues that the Germain application was not material to inventorship.	11.061679170239998
	We agree with Meihao that the Germain application was material to inventorship.	11.051953052998284
	The ¡¬766 patent and Germain have many claims that are nearly identical.	10.92140063756424
	Did you consider disclosing the Germain application to the PTO?	10.916755908940205
	During the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent, Leviton did not disclose the Germain application or the fact that certain claims had been copied from Germain into the application for the ¡¬766 patent.	10.914808754541994
	And dependent claims 3, 4, 13 and 14 of the ¡¬766 patent are identical to Germain claims 32, 31, 43 and 44.	10.914781373761448
	It was clear that the ¡¬766 application was prior art ... to the Germain.	10.913527134666325
	Nevertheless, Narcisse did put forward two explanations for his failure to disclose the Germain application.	10.76267976352982
	Narcisse alone drafted the claims in both the Germain application and the ¡¬766 patent application in the course of just six months.	10.75619649155106
	Yet Narcisse has put forward no such explanation.	10.579741558435853
	Leviton argues that Narcisse offered a reasonable explanation for why he did not inform the PTO of the Germain application: he did not believe that Germain was prior art because the priority date of the ¡¬766 patent was at least three years before Leviton filed the Germain application.	10.39172708473153
	Greenberg Traurig attorneys Paul Sutton, Barry Magidoff, and Claude Narcisse filed and prosecuted the Germain application.	9.678459870348659
	First, Narcisse claimed that he did not disclose the Germain application as a result of his belief that the Germain application was not material because it "was not a prior art reference to the ¡¬766 [patent] application".	9.671972162999566
	It lists Franz Germain and five others as co-inventors.	9.439217920469897
	At worst, the Germain application could have prevented the ¡¬766 patent from issuing.	9.429330731854137
	Narcisse first referenced the Germain application and asserted that it was not material information in a memorandum to the PTO dated August 7, 2007.	9.103544273985635
	While we conclude that Narcisse's failure to disclose the Germain application was material, we cannot agree that Narcisse's explanation of his thoughts at the time were unreasonable as a matter of law.	9.0191245122632
	As such, there is no question that Narcisse knew of the related litigation.	8.81321883987932
	In light of these glaring facts, an inference of deceptive intent is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from Narcisse's withholding of the Germain application.	8.50346472093843
	Throughout Narcisse's deposition, he refused to answer many questions about the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent and his withholding of the Germain application.	8.465208049860466
	Narcisse's second explanation for his failure to disclose the Germain application is based on a technical reading of the language "of another" in 37 C.F.R.	8.45739506256301
	Leviton argues that its failure to disclose Germain was not material for any of the reasons cited by the district court, contending that: (1) Leviton did not "copy" claims under 37 C.F.R. ¡± 10.23(c)(7); (2) the disclosure of Germain would not be material to inventorship; (3) the disclosure of Germain would not be material to double patenting; and (4) the disclosure of Germain would not be material to written description.	8.36364617341587
	The ¡¬766 patent and the Germain application have no common inventors, and neither claims priority to the other.	8.194020441289949
	So isn't it a fact that Claim 1 of the ¡¬766 application was copied from Claim 31 of the Germain application?	8.187053047222552
	We agree with Leviton that the Germain application is not material to the written description requirement.	8.185274197124684
	Although the ¡¬766 patent application claimed the same invention as the Germain application, Narcisse attributed the ¡¬766 patent application to a completely different set of inventors.	7.887257928397424
	Even if, as the majority holds, Narcisse was correct that 37 C.F.R. ¡± 1.604(b) did not mandate disclosure of the Germain application, this is a technical argument about a specific disclosure provision.	7.64159781259337
	Narcisse further admitted that he did not disclose the existence of the related litigation.	7.558765110884834
	Narcisse's best explanation for his failure to inform the PTO about the Germain application is that he did not think it was material because it was not prior art.	7.398532757989116
	Without the Germain application, however, the examiner had no reason to question the asserted inventorship.	7.369434363423748
	Meihao responds that a reasonable examiner would consider Germain material to double patenting.	7.33990561848518
	We agree with Meihao and the district court that Leviton's failure to disclose the Germain application was material.	7.276068177658331
	During Narcisse's deposition, counsel made 96 privileged advice and work product objections, and over a third of the time explicitly instructed Narcisse not to answer.	7.073691111703854
	The district court inferred an intent to deceive based on Narcisse's failure to advise the PTO of the Germain application and related litigation, which is an omission, not an affirmative misrepresentation.	6.986302927250434
	More importantly, the district court correctly rejected Narcisse's explanation as implausible.	6.735248826128555
	Narcisse's rationale for failing to disclose the Germain application is thus inconsistent with MPEP provisions that he admits he was familiar with at the time he prosecuted the ¡¬766 patent.	6.679364324691573
	Afterwards, Narcisse prepared a continuation of the ¡¬558 patent with claims directed to that feature.	6.637087901319101
	Thus, it is indisputable that Narcisse's supposed reasoning is entirely incorrect.	6.625383457004914
	Throughout Narcisse's deposition, he was repeatedly asked about his rationale for withholding both the Germain application and the related litigation but refused to answer numerous questions on these topics.	6.596037615554727
	Thus, we hold that Leviton's failure to disclose the Germain application during the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent was material.	6.5484735691809846
	Accordingly, we conclude that knowledge of the Germain application during the ¡¬766 patent prosecution would be material.	6.548256793591351
	Leviton explains the similarity by stating that several months after Narcisse filed the Germain application, he met with several Leviton engineers, including William Ziegler, one of the inventors of the ¡¬558 patent.	6.311435976887736
	Thus, in light of the importance of the Germain application to inventorship and double-patenting issues in the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent, I would affirm the district court's finding that the Germain application was "highly material".	6.292969330132513
	Leviton's proposed inference that Narcisse did not disclose the Germain application because he did not believe it was material prior art and did not think 37 C.F.R. ¡± 1.604(b) required its disclosure is simply unreasonable.	6.106329671200431
	The majority is also silent regarding Narcisse's admission that he was familiar with MPEP	6.086039301858681
	As such, regardless of whether the inventorship of the ¡¬766 patent is correct, the withheld Germain application was "highly material".	6.043694971920718
	Third, Leviton argues that the district court erred by considering the Germain patent material to double patenting.	6.005831280911872
	Narcisse also submitted several standard PTO forms titled "Information Disclosure Statement by Applicant" that comply with PTO rules, but these IDS forms did not list the Germain application.	5.995905845632419
	The ¡¬766 patent's claimed 1999 priority date is three and a half years before Germain's claimed 2003 priority date.	5.968056664032843
	This purported explanation does not affect the other obvious reasons why the Germain application should have been disclosed to the PTO during the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent.	5.96615921220824
	As with the Germain application, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the district court could not infer, on summary judgment, that Narcisse withheld information about the related litigation with deceptive intent.	5.958788313023133
	In addition, Narcisse later submitted a memorandum during ¡¬766 reexamination proceedings disclosing all of the related litigations, and he summarized the inequitable conduct allegations that had been made with respect to the Germain application.	5.9317550566833095
	In arguing that Narcisse admitted his awareness of his duty to disclose the related litigation, Meihao's counsel cited the wrong page of Narcisse's deposition testimony.	5.909509256383936
	Nevertheless, Narcisse provided absolutely no explanation for failing to disclose the related litigation.	5.894543315676558
	Narcisse did not provide any rationale for believing these concerns to be inapplicable to his prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent.	5.871479021688058
	Nevertheless, because a reasonable examiner would want to consider the Germain application with respect to inventorship and double patenting, the district court correctly concluded that the failure to disclose the Germain application during the ¡¬766 patent prosecution was material.	5.75972552852431
	Meihao refers to a number of findings by the magistrate judge that support its conclusion: (1) Narcisse failed to provide a credible explanation for why he did not notify the PTO about the "copying" of claim language from the Germain application; (2) Leviton had a strong motive to deceive because moving the claims from the Germain application to the ¡¬766 patent would allow Leviton to avoid several years of potentially invalidating art; (3) Narcisse's experience and knowledge meant that he should have known about his duty to disclose the Germain application; and (4) there was no evidence of countervailing good faith in Leviton's dealings with the PTO.	5.62692830293679
	Instead, given the obvious reasons the application would have been highly important to the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent, as well as Narcisse's awareness of the substantially similar claims and that such a situation could lead to a double-patenting rejection, the overwhelming circumstantial evidence suggests that Narcisse purposefully withheld the Germain application.	5.56136437611042
	We next consider whether Leviton withheld the Germain application and related litigation with an intent to deceive the PTO.	5.494654316510231
	Leviton did not disclose the Germain application or the related litigation to the PTO during the seven months in which the examiner reconsidered the patentability of the ¡¬766 patent.	5.4740341153464875
	Because an inference of deceptive intent is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts surrounding Narcisse's withholding of the Germain application, I disagree with the majority's refusal to uphold the district court's finding of intent.	5.417855464267716
	In sum, Narcisse all but admitted that he withheld the related litigation with deceptive intent.	5.353371923407223
	The fact that Narcisse has provided no excuse for his actions is not, as the majority implies, Meihao's only evidence of intent.	5.309800010964667
	Narcisse also admitted that he understood that this provision was part of his "duty of disclosure".	5.2964298486078425
	At that meeting, Narcisse learned that the broad reverse-wiring protection concept he claimed in the Germain application had actually been described in the ¡¬558 patent over three years earlier, having already been invented by Ziegler and DiSalvo.	5.2911035149836145
	More specific to the Germain application, Narcisse acknowledged that he was familiar with the possibility of double-patenting rejections in situations, like the one presented in this case, where commonly-owned applications with different inventive groups claim the same invention.	5.172035185640128
	The majority "agrees with Meihao and the district court that ... the Germain application was material," specifically to inventorship and double-patenting, in the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent.	5.154818396370475
	Finally, Leviton argues that the disclosure of the Germain application during the ¡¬766 prosecution would not have affected the examiner's conclusion that the claims were supported by the specification.	5.037516586841115
	Narcisse also admitted that he was familiar with the MPEP provision that mandates disclosure of the related litigation.	4.980645609215781
	Although the majority properly recognizes that disclosure of the Germain application would have raised "serious questions regarding inventorship" and "a substantial inventorship question that would have required additional investigation by the examiner," the majority nonetheless holds that the Germain application was only "material".	4.925117845899766
	Thus, the district court could not find Narcisse's explanation to be implausible without an evidentiary hearing.	4.900034802982172
	In light of Narcisse's critical admissions during his deposition, there is simply no other inference to be drawn from the evidence.	4.809614802819212
	For example, Narcisse declined to answer the following questions claiming the work-product exception:	4.8032500430100935
	Any patent practitioner, never mind one with Narcisse's level of experience, would realize that the co-pending Germain application and the ¡¬766 patent application, claiming the same invention but attributing it to different people, could not both issue as patents.	4.773538707066674
	On October 22, 2003, Leviton filed U.S. Patent Application No. 10/690,776 ("Germain application"), which claims priority to a February 3, 2003 provisional application.	4.7401328866678805
	Applying this standard, the Germain application's importance to double-patenting would have made it critical to any examiner's evaluation of the ¡¬766 patent.	4.721880261691054
	First, in holding the Germain application to be merely "material," the majority appears to sidestep our precedent establishing that the Germain application was "highly material" to the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent based on the possibility that its disclosure could result in a double-patenting rejection of the ¡¬766 patent.	4.701986758211739
	Meihao argues that in not disclosing Germain, Leviton withheld the very reference that would have caused any reasonable examiner to question the ¡¬766 patent application's compliance with the statute.	4.6893020205079825
	In June 3, 2005, two months after the ¡¬766 patent issued, Leviton disclosed the ¡¬766 patent, the ¡¬558 patent, and thirty other references during the prosecution of the Germain application.	4.680248755908802
	The Germain application does not affect whether the ¡¬766 patent specification supports its claims, and thus should not affect a reasonable examiner's assessment.	4.6784363814144765
	Specifically, the majority is silent as to Narcisse's awareness that the PTO could issue a double-patenting rejection in a situation like the one presented by the commonly-owned Germain application and ¡¬766 patent application, which claimed the identical invention to different inventive groups.	4.596965676166525
	Narcisse, a veteran patent prosecutor, with twelve years of patent prosecution experience, drafted claims for a patent application, U.S. Patent Application No. 10/690,776 ("the Germain application"), and filed it with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") on behalf of Leviton.	4.500249357025032
	As previously discussed, the Germain application would have been critical to the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent, raising substantial inventorship and double-patenting issues.	4.442561673442017
	In addition to withholding the Germain application, Narcisse did not disclose that the parent patents of the ¡¬766 patent were the subject of twelve litigations before the ¡¬766 patent issued ("the related litigation"), eight of which had allegations of invalidity, unenforceability, or inequitable conduct pending and unresolved during the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent.	4.440527814802507
	The PTO's awareness of the Germain application, at a minimum, would have delayed the expedited prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent application arising out of the Petition to Make Special.	4.433498664503395
	Meihao correctly points out that Narcisse failed to provide any explanation at his deposition for why he did not disclose related litigation.	4.418423450390918
	When Meihao issued subpoenas to Sutton, Magidoff, and Narcisse, the witnesses did not object, did not produce documents, and did not appear for their scheduled depositions.	4.413472947191678
	In this context, Narcisse's interpretation "of another" meant another patent owner, and not another inventive entity.	4.411220289518937
	In September 2005, having learned of the substantively identical claims, the PTO issued a double-patenting rejection of the Germain application in light of the ¡¬766 patent.	4.393077868395456
	The Germain application would have raised serious concerns regarding whether the asserted inventors actually conceived of the invention claimed in the ¡¬766 patent.	4.369526236314848
	In my opinion, given how critical the Germain application would have been to triggering these significant inventorship concerns, it was "highly material" to inventorship.	4.1999772810984615
	Based on the Germain application's importance to inventorship and double-patenting issues, I would uphold the district court's "high materiality" finding.	4.174037554266559
	It seems to me that the circumstances surrounding Leviton's withholding of the Germain application are as egregious as possible short of an explicit admission of intent to deceive the PTO.	4.136762602023876
	He proceeded to file the ¡¬766 patent application with a priority date three-and-a-half years earlier than the Germain application, expedite the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent application, and prosecute the ¡¬766 patent application, through issuance as U.S. Patent No. 6,864,766 ("the ¡¬766 patent"), without informing the PTO about the co-pending Germain application.	4.127469437323745
	He was also admittedly aware of his duty of disclosure and the potential for a double-patenting rejection in this situation, yet did not disclose the Germain application.	4.1247340033667985
	Leviton has never attempted to rebut this showing by providing a justification for Narcisse's failure to disclose the related litigation during the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent.	4.099644387999916
	On the facts of this case, I would uphold the district court's finding of inequitable conduct, including its finding of deceptive intent, based on the conduct of one of Leviton Manufacturing Company, Inc.'s ("Leviton's") patent prosecutors, Claude Narcisse ("Narcisse").	4.058907458430038
	In addition, the Germain application was "highly material" to inventorship issues in the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent. "As a critical requirement for obtaining a patent, inventorship is material".	3.9512409033082823
	In refusing to meaningfully assess the plausibility of Narcisse's purported explanation for withholding the Germain application, the majority diverges from our case law establishing that implausible and specious justifications for withholding material information do not raise a genuine issue of material fact for summary judgment purposes.	3.9159351645004516
	As the district court concluded, the Germain application was "highly material" because it "could have conceivably served as the basis of a double patenting rejection" of the ¡¬766 patent.	3.9117362268469833
	The district court, however, found that the Germain application was not merely "material" but was "highly material," a significant distinction that the majority does not acknowledge.2 Summary Judgment Order at 699-700.	3.894617184098031
	Accordingly, I would uphold the district court's determination that, based on its importance to double-patenting concerns, the Germain application was "highly material".	3.8740995801634748
	The district court properly noted that Leviton had a motive to conceal the Germain application, with a priority date three-and-a-half years later than the ¡¬766 patent, during the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent.	3.872444652055543
	Furthermore, the PTO examiner would not have been required to withdraw the rejection as to the earlier-priority ¡¬766 patent application, allowing the ¡¬766 patent to issue as opposed to the Germain application.	3.858855678775144
	As such, Leviton's counsel was also incorrect in asserting his belief that there was not "any testimony that [Narcisse was] aware of this particular provision," namely MPEP ¡± 2001.06(c).	3.8331095688979646
	Leviton contends that Narcisse gave the PTO the information to evaluate the double-patenting issue during the prosecution of the later-priority (but earlier-filed)	3.81963667432044
	Rather, Narcisse's failure to provide a good faith explanation serves only to prevent Leviton from rebutting Meihao's strong showing of intent to deceive.	3.800215530388402
	Nevertheless, when Meihao filed a motion for summary judgment, Leviton chose not to submit an affidavit from Narcisse to further explain his decisions to withhold this information.	3.7843576166484576
	In fact, Narcisse admitted his awareness of MPEP provisions that require the disclosure of information that is obviously not prior art, such as MPEP	3.77379513023153
	At the time he prosecuted the ¡¬766 patent, Narcisse was a seasoned patent attorney, having practiced as a patent prosecutor for approximately twelve years.	3.7281169826518665
	This purported justification ignores the broad spectrum of information, with which Narcisse was admittedly familiar, that the MPEP and the Code of Federal Regulations require to be disclosed.	3.712630794357964
	Under our precedent in Akron Polymer and Dayco Products, which the majority does not mention or distinguish, this potential for a double-patenting rejection is sufficient to make the Germain application "highly material".	3.6975077763050543
	The majority holds that both the Germain application and the related litigation were material to the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent but concludes that the district court could not infer deceptive intent on summary judgment.	3.6794275978847018
	Instead, he admitted that he was aware that the situation that the commonly-owned Germain application and ¡¬766 patent application presented "could give rise to a double [-] patenting rejection".	3.661735398022266

	Leviton filed its appeal brief on June 16, 2006, but did not disclose the Germain application or related litigations to the PTO, though it had been aware of inequitable conduct allegations for over a year.	3.652090027996424
	Specifically, two independent claims and six dependent claims in the ¡¬766 patent application were word-for-word identical to those in the Germain application, with the exception of one insignificant phrase.	3.6440572580512196
	At the oral hearing on Meihao's summary judgment motion, the district court accepted new evidence from Leviton, but Leviton still did not attempt to supplement the record with oral testimony or affidavits from Narcisse or any other witness. "On summary judgment, in order to create a genuine issue, [Leviton] bore the burden of submitting an affidavit from [Narcisse] to contradict [Meihao's] evidence of intent if [it] believed that testimony from [Narcisse] would establish credible evidence for the withholding".	3.6081462663153783
	Meihao also contends that Leviton cannot now argue that the magistrate judge erred by not hearing live testimony from Narcisse because Leviton never sought to present live testimony.	3.561756785070485
	Although Narcisse titled his memorandum "Information Disclosure Statement" ("IDS"), it is not formally an IDS because it does not meet any of the requirements for an IDS.	3.5569308829870026
	First, Narcisse admitted that he was aware of the pending related litigation and that he knew some of these litigations raised allegations of invalidity and unenforceability.	3.538898361184926
	Leviton notes that the examiner stated (in the context of the double-patenting issue) that the ¡¬766 patent "discloses everything claimed [in Germain] except the use of a latched reset lockout with the interrupting device".	3.5350083998482913
	For example, the only difference between claim 1 of the ¡¬766 patent and claim 31 of the Germain application is that claim 1 recites "at least one moveable bridge" whereas claim 31 recites "a movable bridge".	3.4818745152523936
	Moreover, Leviton did not inform the PTO that it had previously submitted a sworn declaration in which other individuals (the Germain inventors) claimed to be inventors of subject matter very similar to that which was now recited in the application for the ¡¬ 766 patent.	3.4749744634474067
	Leviton contends that if the ¡¬766 claims are supported by the common specification of the ¡¬766 and ¡¬558 patents, then Germain and his coinventors could not have conceived the inventions in the ¡¬766 claims, because those inventions were described several years earlier in the ¡¬558 patent.	3.464181713436028
	Second, with respect to deceptive intent, the majority seems to overlook Narcisse's most critical admissions regarding his recognition of the materiality of the withheld information.	3.3674260299698027
	Id. Meihao does not rely on Narcisse's failure to provide a good faith explanation in order to meet its threshold burden to establish deceptive intent.	3.351040587392429
	Narcisse did not disclose the Germain application even though, as he admitted in his deposition testimony, he alone drafted both sets of claims, was aware of the near identicality of the claims in the two applications, and was familiar with double-patenting rejections, which inevitably arise when different inventive groups submit indistinguishable claims in commonly-owned patent applications.	3.237192663572721
	In my opinion, the district court properly rejected Narcisse's justifications as "implausible" and therefore insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.	3.1887952982550796
	Meihao contends that an examiner would not automatically discount the Germain application in determining inventorship simply because it had a later priority date because no person may patent an invention that "he did not himself invent".	3.162702394601171
	Narcisse and Magidoff subsequently appeared for depositions, and Leviton's new counsel made numerous privileged advice and work product objections and repeatedly instructed the witnesses not to answer.	3.1082051285202765
	Leviton argues that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing where Narcisse could fully explain his conduct and the court could assess his credibility.	3.107900023971749
	Another round of briefing ensued, with Meihao seeking an order compelling Narcisse and Magidoff to appear for further deposition and to fully answer Meihao's questions, and also compelling Sutton to appear for deposition.	3.0176114381657726
	Moreover, Leviton contends that the PTO could not use the Germain application to make a double-patenting rejection in the ¡¬766 patent prosecution because the examiner would have allowed the earlier priority patent to issue if there were no other rejections remaining.	2.9953537419294474
	It is implausible that Narcisse, a veteran patent prosecutor and a member of the patent bar for more than a decade, believed that the only material information that must be brought to the PTO's attention is prior art.	2.9909972990612994
	Further, with such an earlier priority date, the ¡¬766 patent avoided a significant amount of prior art, including the allegedly infringing product in this case, which was manufactured after the priority date of the ¡¬766 patent but before the priority date of the Germain application.	2.9864762809537613
	This purported justification is not only entirely incorrect but, in my opinion and in that of the district court, incredulous given the many reasons the Germain application should have been disclosed, including its obvious importance to inventorship and double-patenting issues.	2.94062933292131
	¡± 2001.06(c)	2.9354254325654745
	Specifically, Narcisse acknowledged his awareness of MPEP ¡± 2001.06(c), which requires disclosure of the "existence of ... litigation" involving the subject matter of a patent application and any allegations of inequitable conduct in these litigations.	2.903099381722534
	A "reasonable examiner" evaluating the ¡¬766 patent application would have found the co-pending Germain application, which had several nearly identical claims attributed to an entirely different set of inventors, critical in evaluating patentability.	2.8876233829667224
	Moreover, Meihao points out that, under Manual of Patent Examining Procedure ("MPEP") Section 804, the PTO examiner would first issue a provisional double patenting rejection to both the application for the ¡¬ 766 patent and the Germain application before withdrawing one of those rejections.	2.8593025967041688
	The copying of certain claims from the Germain application with one set of named inventors into the ¡¬766 patent application with another set of inventors suggests that the named inventors may not have, in fact, invented the claimed subject matter.	2.8528679864990836
	Narcisse's many critical admissions regarding his withholding of the related litigation, despite knowing of the information and his duty to disclose it, are more than sufficient to pass this threshold.	2.803160445570142
	The majority properly recognizes that, under MPEP ¡± 804, disclosure of the co-pending, commonly-owned Germain application, with nearly identical claims to the earlier-priority ¡¬766 patent application, would have led to "an immediate provisional [double-patenting] rejection" of each application.	2.7723699891487144
	Narcisse's admissions as to his knowledge of the related litigation and of his duty, yet failure, to disclose the information are more than sufficient for Meihao to meet its threshold burden to show deceptive intent.	2.6801518177772268
	The patent bar, an examination Narcisse passed approximately ten years before prosecuting the ¡¬766 patent, requires familiarity with the MPEP, which obligates patent applicants to disclose to the PTO information other than prior art.	2.6040279242425624
	The majority proceeds to reason that Narcisse's belated disclosure of the related litigation in reexamination proceedings, more than two years after the ¡¬766 patent had issued and Meihao had raised the inequitable conduct allegations in this case, "may be evidence of good faith".	2.3459947450866374
	Leviton's contention at oral argument that "for summary judgment purposes, [the district court] need [ed] to take [Narcisse] at his word [;] ... whether it's a credible explanation or not, it's his explanation," Oral Arg.	2.3179075593844627
	At his deposition, Narcisse admitted that he knew about the related litigation, that he was aware that some of the litigations involved allegations of invalidity or unenforceability, and that he was actually involved in three of the litigations before the ¡¬766 patent issued.	2.3113653741898785
	See MPEP ¡± 2001.06(c).	2.251811879377119
	By admitting personal knowledge of the related litigation and familiarity with the MPEP provision requiring its disclosure, without providing any justification for withholding this information, Narcisse all but admitted that he withheld the related litigation with intent to deceive.	2.232281195366354
	In his deposition testimony, Narcisse admitted that he was familiar with the provision at the time he prosecuted the ¡¬766 patent but claimed that he "didn't think," "didn't know," and was "not sure" whether the provision would have applied to applications "owned by the same entity".	2.224719821025628
	The only reasonable inference to be drawn from Narcisse's unexplained failure to disclose the related litigation, despite his admitted knowledge of the pending related litigation and the MPEP provision that requires its disclosure, is that he deliberately withheld information about the litigations from the PTO.	2.039783151172077
	The majority recognizes Narcisse's "fail [ure] to provide any explanation at his deposition for why he did not disclose [the] related litigation" but goes on to cite Larson Manufacturing for the proposition that "the failure to provide an explanation is not independently dispositive of whether a patent prosecutor intended to deceive the PTO".	2.007026942115553
	Not surprisingly, Narcisse admitted in his deposition testimony that when he prosecuted the ¡¬766 patent, he was aware of his duty of disclosure and his understanding that "in cases which are not entirely clear, it is better to disclose the information to the [PTO] and let the [PTO] decide what is material".	1.9006679553191872
	This specific inconsistency, together with the fact that it is inconceivable that a patent prosecutor with more than a decade of experience would equate materiality solely with prior art, leads me to firmly agree with the district court's conclusion that Narcisse's purported justification is entirely implausible and insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.	1.6848962122276863
	Given that Meihao met its threshold burden to prove intent, the district court correctly considered Leviton's purported good faith explanation for withholding the Germain application. "The patentee need not offer any good faith explanation unless the [party asserting inequitable conduct] first carries [its] burden to prove a threshold level of intent to deceive by clear and convincing evidence".	1.627027209814972
	Thus, the majority's suggestion that Leviton may be able to establish good faith in the prosecution of the ¡¬766 patent by its disclosure of the related litigation years after the patent issued, where Narcisse knew of the related litigation and his duty to disclose it at the time of the initial prosecution, is, in my view, contrary to our precedent.	1.615451617157106
