	The preamble reads, "a method of increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone to a patient receiving metaxalone therapy".	13.650981042494914
	As taught by the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent, the only steps required to increase metaxalone's bioavailability are (1) ingesting metaxalone (2) with food.	12.944915359590949
	Independent claim 7 claims a "method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal conditions" by "obtaining metaxalone from a container providing information that administration of metaxalone with food" increases the drug's bioavailability and "ingesting the metaxalone with food".	12.39751491673932
	Dependent claims 9 through 11 limit claim 8 to metaxalone from a container with printed information concerning the increased bioavailability of the drug (claim 9), metaxalone in a tablet form (claim 10), and 400 mg of metaxalone (claim 11).	10.231713269008308
	In re Bilski and held that "the act of informing another person of the food effect of metaxalone does not transform metaxalone into a different state or thing".	9.958178624645612
	According to the district court, an increase in the bioavailability of metaxalone is an inherent property of taking metaxalone with food, which is disclosed in each of Fathie II, Albanese, and Abrams.	9.875905473898639
	claims a method for using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal conditions comprising both "providing" a patient with a "therapeutically effective amount of metaxalone" and "informing" the patient that taking metaxalone with food increases the bioavailability of the drug.	9.65943942818783
	Independent claim 6 claims a "method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal conditions" consisting of "informing a patient" that taking metaxalone with food increases the bioavailability of the drug compared to taking metaxalone without food.	9.426955388759358
	King markets and sells a name brand version of metaxalone called Skelaxin.	9.045554508966925
	The district court then concluded that "because the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent teaches nothing more than administering metaxalone with food to increase its bioavailability and because Fathie II, Albanese and Abrams all teach administering metaxalone with food-which inherently increases metaxalone's bioavailability-claim 1 is anticipated".	8.953908101720142
	Claim 1 claims "a method of increasing the oral bioavailability of metaxalone" by "administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical composition with food".	8.906702868668377
	22 claims the method of claim 1 with the additional limitation that "the metaxalone is from a container with printed labeling advising" that taking metaxalone with food will increase the drug's bioavailability.	8.874885505149958
	King's experts' opinions that "even a disclosure of taking metaxalone with food would not inherently disclose increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone," do not undermine our analysis.	8.83591995215959
	Because the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent discloses no more than taking metaxalone with food, to the extent such a method increases the bioavailability of metaxalone, the identical prior art method does as well.	8.832617531311767
	An increase in metaxalone's bioavailability is, therefore, an inherent aspect of the prior art.	8.64946738608032
	Finally, claim 15 depends from claim 8 and limits the metaxalone to a 400 mg tablet with a printed label that states certain percentage increases in the bioavailability of the metaxalone.	8.60007912558505
	Starting with independent claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent, the district court found the claim's preamble-"a method of increasing the oral bioavailability of metaxalone to a patient receiving metaxalone therapy"-inherently anticipated because "an increase in the bioavailability of metaxalone is inherent when the drug is taken with food".	8.15193514804977
	The prior art discloses taking metaxalone with food, but not the natural result of this process.	8.030751318443526
	Rather, it occurs naturally in most people when they take metaxalone with food".	8.026980904396702
	Reviewed as a whole, claim 21 teaches a method of treating patients with metaxalone, whereby the patient is administered metaxalone with food and informed that such treatment increases the bioavailability of the drug.	7.890004864765753
	Fathie II, Albanese, and Abrams respectively disclose administering metaxalone "with food," "with meals," and "with food or milk".	7.872511371593926
	For further support, King cites its own expert reports which conclude that "even a disclosure of taking metaxalone with food would not inherently disclose increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone".	7.853654418359677
	Independent claim 8 claims a "method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculosketal conditions" comprising both administering metaxalone with food and informing the patient that such administration increases the bioavailability of the drug.	7.644753249598472
	Claim 5  Claim 5 depends from claim 1 and limits the metaxalone to a "unit dosage form".	7.475016033521113
	According to the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent, the natural result of taking metaxalone with food is an increase in the bioavailability of the drug.	7.451543654390726
	Claim 9 claims a method for increasing "the rate and extent of absorption ... of metaxalone ... in the blood stream" by "administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical composition with food".	7.40493128809335
	Irrespective of whether the patient is informed about the benefits, the actual method, taking metaxalone with food, is the same.	7.247525894159681
¡°	The patent discloses a method of "increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone by administration of an oral dosage form with food".	6.821356947994311
	It would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine Dent's teaching of taking a tablet dosage of metaxalone four times a day with Albanese's teaching of administering metaxalone with food.	6.801005051264752
	King has not shown any connection between administering metaxalone in a "unit dosage form" and the alleged commercial success.	6.751279073360091
	The claims limit the time frame in which the patient must ingest the metaxalone in relation to consuming food.	6.682778638162722
	A.H. Robins Company, Inc. A.H. Robins began selling metaxalone under the brand name Skelaxin in 1962.	6.427309054650062
	As an initial matter, King's attempt to link an increase in metaxalone's bioavailability to specific food conditions is untenable.	6.205314371775079
	Yet, according to King's own experts, "with food" could mean taking metaxalone "1 hour prior to up to about 2 hours after eating".	6.071647795495216
	Claim 1 Claim 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½102 patent is an independent claim, which claims a "method of using metaxalone in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions" comprising both "providing the patient with a therapeutically effective amount of metaxalone" and "informing the patient that administration with food results in an increase in the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC(last)) of metaxalone compared to administration without food".	5.954743957856907
	Claims 12, 13, and 14 depend from claim 9 and limit the printed label to stating certain percentage increases in the bioavailability of metaxalone.	5.783931747457365
	Like the ï¿½ï¿½ 128 patent, the ï¿½ï¿½102 patent discloses a method of "increasing the bioavailability of metaxalone by administration of an oral dosage form with food".	5.774718276371778
	The reference guide also instructs nurses to give metaxalone "with milk or food" in order to "decrease gastrointestinal distress".	5.761201886784894
	According to King, while the prior art may disclose taking metaxalone with food, it does not disclose increasing the bioavailability of the drug.	5.725372288252448
	Claim 17 claims a method similar to claim 1, but limits the effective amount of metaxalone to between 400 and 800 mg and defines an increase in bioavailability as "an increase in the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC(last)) of metaxalone compared to administration without food".	5.723779526808747
	Moreover, the written description in no way suggests that the specific food conditions disclosed were necessary for increasing metaxalone's bioavailability.	5.720678468760771
	On August 31, 2004, Eon filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") for a generic 800 mg metaxalone tablet.	5.6904276079929055
	With respect to claim 5, the claimed invention is the administration of metaxalone in a tablet that constitutes a "unit dosage form".	5.676472559678847
	Claim 1  Claim 1 is an independent claim requiring the administration of "a therapeutically effective amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical composition with food".	5.645633996622526
	Albanese, published nineteen years prior to the filing of the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent, teaches administering metaxalone "with meals" to "reduce gastric upset".	5.476284400173456
	Dependent claims 2, 3, 10, and 11 specify that the "therapeutically effective amount" of metaxalone is "200 mg to 900 mg" (claims 2 and 10) or "400 mg to 800 mg" (claims 3 and 11).	5.469194614761869
	Eon Labs, Inc., No. 03-0006 (E.D.N.Y.) (the "400 mg Action"), that Elan filed in 2001 against Eon after Eon filed an ANDA for a generic 400 mg metaxalone tablet.	5.430452556163875
	Action was pending, King filed suit against Eon when Eon filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic 800 mg metaxalone tablet, the 800 mg Action.	5.346118429112331
	In other words, the increase in metaxalone's bioavailability is the " 'natural result' flowing from the [prior art's] explicitly explicated limitations".	5.334984593156718
	And, Abrams, published six years prior to the filing of the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent, teaches administering metaxalone "with milk or food" to "decrease gastrointestinal distress".	5.315957168131829
	While the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent's written description discloses specific conditions for food consumption, its claims only recite taking metaxalone "with food".	5.306156802690285
	Claim 22 depends from claim 1 and limits claim 1's method to situations "wherein the metaxalone is from a container with printed labeling advising that administration with food results in an increase in the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC(last)) of metaxalone compared to administration without food".	5.245039336853822
	Fathie II describes a clinical study in which patients were given 800 mg of metaxalone to be taken three to five times a day.	5.1494696506399364
	Claim 21  Claim 21 depends from claim 1 and adds the limitation "informing the patient that administration of a therapeutically effective amount of metaxalone in a pharmaceutical composition with food results in an increase in the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC(last)) of metaxalone compared to administration without food".	5.0842755012608505
	As for the merits of King's argument, we first note that Fathie II, Albanese, and Abrams each disclose administering metaxalone "with food" or "with meals" to treat musculoskeletal conditions.	5.052800900665563
	Fathie II, published thirty-six years prior to the filing of the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent, teaches administering metaxalone "with food" to reduce nausea.	5.001242191241188
	The guide discloses that metaxalone is available in 400 mg tablets and recommends a dosage range of 800 mg three to four times daily.	4.9578268356751805
	The reference guide discloses providing patients with 800 mg of metaxalone three or four times daily for not more than ten consecutive days.	4.872704428476919
	Claims 4 through 7 were also found anticipated because the prior art disclosed taking metaxalone with food within the various time frames claimed.	4.814982641132377
	The district court then found claim 21 invalid under 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 101 because the claim's "informing" limitation did not "transform the metaxalone into a different state or thing".	4.801677289074534
	The district court initially consolidated the 400 and 800 mg Actions, but eventually dismissed the 400 mg Action when Eon withdrew its 400 mg metaxalone ANDA.	4.667012722755944
	Under this common-sense definition of "with food," the prior art discloses a timeframe for ingesting metaxalone in relation to consuming food that falls within the timeframes claimed by claims 4-6.	4.471081806849401
	Dependent claim 21 claims the method of claim 1 with the additional limitation of "informing" the patient that taking metaxalone with food will increase the drug's bioavailability, and dependent claim	4.392658949886185
	Thus, the relevant inquiry here is whether the additional instructional limitation of claim 21 has a "new and unobvious functional relationship" with the known method of administering metaxalone with food.	4.371639139428268
	Rather, the written description teaches that the claimed increase in metaxalone's bioavailability can be achieved through the consumption of "a meal, such as breakfast, lunch or dinner". ï¿½ï¿½128 patent col.2 ll.37-38.	4.368793407221723
	Specifically, at oral argument, King's counsel argued that the "informing" limitation increases the likelihood that the patient will take metaxalone with food, thereby increasing the efficiency of the method.	4.266524172535587
	The district court next addressed the ï¿½ï¿½102 patent, reading claim 1 to "require[ ] giving a patient metaxalone and informing the patient about an inherent property of the drug".	4.21909715486786
	The claimed invention is the result of "the unexpected finding that administration of metaxalone with food increases both the rate and extent of absorption via the oral dosage form in human subjects".	4.066594442750772
	Patent holder filed action against competitor alleging infringement of patents directed toward methods of informing patients about and administering muscle relaxant metaxalone.	4.028281097223288
	In January 2003, after Eon filed an ANDA with the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for a generic 400 mg metaxalone tablet, it was sued by Elan for infringement of the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent, the 400 mg Action.	3.8515680108537516
	On appeal, King argues the district court erred because Eon did not provide any evidence or expert testimony that the prior art would necessarily result in an increase in metaxalone's bioavailability.	3.8398412619397075
	As the district court found, however, a significant portion of the increase in Skelaxin sales occurred prior to the determination that ingesting metaxalone with food increases the drug's bioavailability and well before the patents issued.	3.676940113590034
	Claim 17 was also found anticipated because the claim's "wherein the administration [of metaxalone] results in an increase in [bioavailability]" language, like claim 1's preamble, is an inherent property of the prior art.	3.67636794575957
	King argues that the prior art's disclosure (taking metaxalone with food to reduce gastric discomfort) is vague as to the conditions under which the food was administered such that it was improper for the district court to assume that an increase in bioavailability was necessarily disclosed.	3.509222713589313
	As for claim 8, the district court found that no reference disclosed taking a single tablet of metaxalone with food, but held the claim obvious in light of a prior art reference, 18 R.W. DENT, JR.	3.3831168855387843
	Turning to the district court's obviousness analysis, the district court held that a prior art reference, Dent, disclosed taking metaxalone in a single 400 mg tablet four times a day.	3.360869854385286
	Dependent claims 4-6, 12-14, and 18-20 specify specific times for administering the metaxalone relative to the consumption of food, either thirty minutes prior to two hours after consumption of food (claims 4, 12 and 18), "substantially at the same time" as consumption of food (claims 5, 13 and 19), or up to one hour after consumption of food (claims 6, 14 and 20).	3.349932251086623
	In analyzing claim 1, the district court held that administering metaxalone to a patient was disclosed in the prior art, the "informing" limitation was not patentable for the same reasons as claim 21 of the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent, and the entire claim was invalid under ï¿½ï¿½ 101.	3.2115087761988557
	Finally, claims 12 through 15, which "differ from the prior art only in the content of the written material that accompanies the metaxalone," were, like claim 22 of the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent, anticipated because "a variation in written material that is not functionally related to the invention does not render a known product patentable".	2.829897099814376
	claim directed toward methods of informing patients about and administering muscle relaxant metaxalone was invalid due to anticipation; broad terms used in patent's claims could not be limited to specific food conditions disclosed in written description; claims limiting time frame in which patient had to ingest metaxalone had been anticipated by prior; instructional limitation, that taking drug with food increased bioavailability of drug, had been anticipated; printed label claim had been anticipated; commercial success of patented product was not objective indication of nonobviousness; patent claim directed toward methods of informing patients about and administering muscle relaxant metaxalone was obvious; and actual case or controversy did not exist between competitor and corporation after corporation sold all its interests in asserted patents to another entity.	2.728793245070575
	In other words, in light of our holding that the method of taking metaxalone with food to increase the drug's bioavailability, as recited in claim 1, is not patentable, it readily follows that claim 21, which recites the same method with the sole additional step of informing the patient about this increase in bioavailability, is not patentable.	2.6510877292919317
	Eon filed with the ANDA a patent certification pursuant to 21 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) ("Paragraph IV Certification"), which alleged that none of the claims of the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent would be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of Eon's generic 800 mg metaxalone tablet, and that all the claims of the ï¿½ï¿½128 patent are invalid.	2.648916576825231
	Participants in the study were given fifteen minutes to eat the following before administration of the metaxalone: two eggs (fried in butter), two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes, and one glass whole milk (eight ounces).	2.4605805433181587

	The district court, relying on this court's printed matter precedent as articulated in In re Ngai, found the claim anticipated by Fathie II, Albanese, and Abrams.	1.3371899249035177
