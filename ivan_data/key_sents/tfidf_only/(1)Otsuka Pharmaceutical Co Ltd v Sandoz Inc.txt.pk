	Drugs that treat schizophrenia are called antipsychotics.	7.09462230245764
	For example, Murasaki 1987 teaches that "the antipsychotic action [of OPC-4392] was not strong".	5.94877246080032
	Since then the FDA has approved seven other atypical antipsychotics:	5.475965512844535
	(1) converting OPC-4392's carbostyril core into a dihydrocarbostyril; (2) changing OPC-4392's propoxy linker to a butoxy; and (3) replacing OPC-4392's 2-methyl and 3-methyl groups with 2-chloro and 3-chloro substituents.	5.418559102005826
	OPC-4392 is an Otsuka development compound and, as of the priority date of the ï¿½ï¿½528 patent, was the only carbostyril derivative tested in humans as a potential antipsychotic.	5.317198789636525
	At the relevant time, there were no carbostyril compounds that were marketed as antipsychotics or were publicly known to have potent antipsychotic activity with minimal side effects.	5.188504346795514
	The Defendants contend that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the prior art carbostyril derivative compounds at the time aripiprazole was invented.	5.18686007417229
	Connected to aripiprazole's butoxy linker is a piperazine ring and a phenyl ring.	5.167436153242183
	The FDA approved risperidone, the first postclozapine atypical antipsychotic, in 1994.	5.0743806045781055
	Compound 6, an unsubstituted propoxy, had an ED 50 of 9.3; and Compound 16, a 4-chloro substituted propoxy, had an ED 50 of 15.1.	5.055945987541013
	Connected to the 7-position of aripiprazole's carbostyril core is a "butoxy linker" consisting of four methylene (-CH2-) units.	4.958551226884986
	According to the Defendants, the district court erred by failing to find that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the SE ï¿½ï¿½945 application, which taught that the 2,3-dichloro propoxy compound had antipsychotic activity.	4.627380392082435
	"the pharmaceutical composition of claim 16 wherein the carbostyril compound" is aripiprazole, id.	4.560706117645057
	According to the Defendants, prior art compounds, including the 2,3-dichloro propoxy, the unsubstituted butoxy, and OPC-4392, were known to have antipsychotic activity, and it would have been obvious to chemically modify them in the ways necessary to make aripiprazole.	4.543426681668394
	The Nakagawa declaration neither disclosed nor would have suggested a 2,3-dichloro substituted antipsychotic compound.	4.376077350088049
	The first antipsychotic drug, chlorpromazine, was discovered by accident in the early 1950s.	4.350540573654345
	The 2,3-Dichloro Propoxy Compound	4.292237095107898
	Noting the structural differences between aripiprazole and the unsubstituted butoxy, the court found that the prior art did not teach one of ordinary skill to achieve antipsychotic activity by modifying the unsubstituted butoxy with a 2,3-dichloro substitution on its phenyl ring to make aripiprazole.	4.240780364597682
	Researchers refer to both variants as "carbostyril derivatives".	4.168325262068824
	The Defendants rely selectively on the disclosure in Murasaki 1987 that OPC-4392 was "an antipsychotic drug," J.A. 5907, and the fact that OPC-4392 proceeded to Phase II clinical trials.	4.141902828435388
	Finally, they argue that aripiprazole's properties and other secondary considerations do not render aripiprazole nonobvious.	4.131134074731007
	carbostyrils could not be considered prior art;	4.02262430201058
	This carbostyril derivative, which has the following chemical structure, has a 2,3- dimethyl substituted phenyl ring, a propoxy linker, and a carbostyril ring containing a double bond at the 3, 4-position:	3.8653013310113757
	Experts testified that the discovery of new antipsychotic drugs in the 1980s was "very unpredictable," J.A. 30660, and that antipsychotic research at that time was "notoriously unsuccessful," J.A. 30453.	3.8636949044239968
	The two most potent carbostyril derivatives tested in the mouse jumping study have a 5-propoxy linker, i.e., a propoxy substituent connected at the 5-position of the carbostyril core.	3.845751524977903
	"There was no known antipsychotic drug, successful or otherwise, that had those two particular [chlorine] substituents arranged in a 2,3 ... orientation," and, further, "there's no teaching that suggests that a dichlorination pattern like that would lead to a safe atypical antipsychotic, or even an antipsychotic, period, atypical or otherwise".	3.7281682713016617
	ED 50	3.693593580371104
	As we explained above, aripiprazole differs structurally from the unsubstituted butoxy of claim 13 of the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent.	3.6309207440639044
	Despite their drawbacks, typical antipsychotics are still used today.	3.5721067367661106
	The Defendants do not allege obviousness over the structurally dissimilar Compound 44, which, unlike aripiprazole, has a propoxy linker connected at the 5-position of its carbostyril core and a 2-ethoxy substituent on its phenyl ring.	3.552964933933819
	Accordingly, we conclude that the Defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the 2,3-dichloro propoxy.	3.50951509382336
	Of the 7-linked carbostyril derivatives for which Dr. Nakagawa provided mouse jumping data, Compound 39, a 3-chloro substituted propoxy,2 had an ED 50 of 2.5; Compound 43, a 2-chloro substituted propoxy, had an ED 50 of 3.4; Compound 41, the unsubstituted butoxy, had an ED 50 of 5.5;	3.439243250405082

	Every FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic has a chemical structure related either to clozapine or risperidone, with the sole exception of aripiprazole-the compound at issue in the present appeal.	3.3463121306020245
	Aripiprazole is a "carbostyril derivative," that is, its chemical structure contains a quinolinone fused ring (labeled as "3,4-dihydrocarbostyril" in the structure above).	3.3430458118121797
	Taken as a whole, however, the prior art taught away from using OPC-4392 as a starting point for further antipsychotic research.	3.296298699626111
	The parties refer to this compound as the "2,3-dichloro propoxy" because its phenyl ring is substituted with a chlorine atom at the 2 and 3 positions and it has a propoxy linker connecting its carbostyril core and its piperazine ring.	3.2941296868158116
	LEXIS 132595 at (comparing the ED 50 value of 2.1 for a 5-linked unsubstituted propoxy and the ED 50 value of 9.3 for a 7-linked unsubstituted propoxy and finding that this "significant" difference "would teach the skilled artisan the superiority of 5-linked propoxy compounds over 7-linked propoxy compounds").	3.224187436077054
	Evaluating the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art, the district court found that the asserted prior art did not teach one of ordinary skill to select the unsubstituted butoxy, the 2,3-dichloro propoxy, or OPC-4392 as a lead compound for further antipsychotic research.	3.2178730916748655
	These were the only promising antipsychotic compounds at the time the present inventors began their work.	3.21458733328268

	The United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") last approved a typical antipsychotic in 1975.	3.189087825316888
	Although the Nakagawa declaration nowhere mentions schizophrenia or antipsychotic activity, and despite conflicting evidence regarding the use of mouse jumping test data in antipsychotic drug discovery, the district court found that Dr. Nakagawa's mouse jumping data "could be indicative of potential antipsychotic activity to the skilled artisan".	3.1774287630199907
	The parties refer to this compound as the "unsubstituted butoxy," because its phenyl ring is unsubstituted and it has a butoxy linker connecting the 7-position of its carbostyril core to its piperazine ring.	3.165564549529619
	The SE ï¿½ï¿½945 application "discloses dozens of carbostyril compounds," and the 2,3-dichloro propoxy "is just one of ninety-six different compounds disclosed in Example 134 alone".	3.1427014423033173
	person of ordinary skill would not have been motivated to pursue 2,3-dichloro substitution on phenyl ring as would have been required to convert unsubstituted butoxy to aripiprazole.	3.111490676875423
	A "propoxy linker," in contrast, consists of only three methylene units.	3.0420469668194383
	The court considered whether aripiprazole and its uses are not patentably distinct from the unsubstituted butoxy in claim 13 of the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent.	3.024426601749519
	The terminal phenyl ring of aripiprazole is "2,3-dichloro" substituted, meaning that it has chlorine atoms connected to the 2 and 3 positions.	3.015568656835841
	The district court thus correctly found that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected the 2,3-dichloro propoxy compound as a lead compound for further antipsychotic research.	3.0000895187673384
	Furthermore, as Otsuka points out, the Defendants' theory that aripiprazole would have been obvious over the unsubstituted butoxy and the 2,3-dichloro propoxy rested in large part upon an asserted "bracketing theory"-i.e., that one would have combined those two asserted compounds to arrive at aripiprazole, which shares some structural features of both.	2.9917641109784765
	Clozapine was the first "atypical" antipsychotic, in that it had a diminished propensity to cause EPS and was useful for treating both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.	2.991214216357337
	A prior art publication from January 1988 by the same author stated that OPC-4392 was "expected to have some advantageous effects different from those of conventional antipsychotic drugs," such as chlorpromazine.	2.97189975996937
	The Defendants contend that the court erred by finding that a skilled artisan would not have selected the unsubstituted butoxy as a lead compound for antipsychotic drug discovery.	2.9634723766065503
	Researchers' efforts were largely unsuccessful, however, and the FDA approved no new antipsychotic drugs between 1976 and 1989.	2.892740671233039
	The court thus did not err in concluding that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected OPC-4392 as a lead compound for further antipsychotic research.	2.8729929062999404
	Although clozapine remains the "gold standard" with respect to efficacy, the other atypical antipsychotics are considered at least as effective as typical antipsychotics for treating positive symptoms, while also treating negative symptoms and causing fewer EPS side effects.	2.8162093488034015
	Otsuka, in response, argues that the court, after considering the Nakagawa declaration in detail, correctly concluded that aripiprazole was not an obvious variant of the unsubstituted butoxy.	2.793253727132581
	The 2,3-dichloro propoxy was disclosed in two prior art foreign counterparts to Otsuka's ï¿½ï¿½416 patent:	2.785271291110571
	The DE ï¿½ï¿½105 patent "is substantially the same as the SE ï¿½ï¿½945 application except that the DE ï¿½ï¿½105 Patent omits any mention of potential antipsychotic activity".	2.7707124118539617
	Otsuka points out that no carbostyril derivative had been shown to effectively treat schizophrenia as of the priority date of the ï¿½ï¿½528 patent.	2.7665490929738796
	Defs.-Appellants Apotex, at 46-47 (arguing that Otsuka's aripiprazole development involved a "short timeline" and only "took a few months").	2.7112516077543374
	Aripiprazole is the active ingredient in the antipsychotic drug marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ("Otsuka") under the brand name Abilify THE-R.	2.6979663080330902
	The district court also credited the testimony of one of the Defendants' witnesses, who stated that clinical studies of OPC-4392 showed that it "lacked [an] antipsychotic component".	2.678722967328105
	As explained by Dr. Bryan Roth, whom the court credited as an expert in schizophrenia , antipsychotic drug discovery, and psychopharmacology, one of ordinary skill in the art would not have understood the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent's "laundry list" of potential central nervous system controlling effects to mean that every carbostyril derivative disclosed in the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent is a potential antipsychotic.	2.6716153420445474
	Although Nakagawa's mouse jumping data "could be indicative of potential antipsychotic activity to the skilled artisan," Otsuka, 2010 WL 4596324, at *10, 2010 U.S. Dist.	2.6403544990286507
	Claim 12 of the ï¿½ï¿½528 patent claims aripiprazole using its chemical name.	2.588433495460788
	Otsuka also contends that the district court did not require proof that aripiprazole was the "most obvious" compound, but rather evaluated all of the potential choices available to one of ordinary skill and determined that the prior art did not suggest that the unsubstituted butoxy, 2,3-dichloro propoxy, or OPC-4392 would be suitable lead compounds.	2.5371048694298426
	As the district court correctly found, the SE ï¿½ï¿½945 application lists the 2,3-dichloro propoxy compound "as one among hundreds of examples that may be useful for an extensive list of potential central nervous system controlling activities," id., and fails to tie the 2,3-dichloro propoxy to any meaningful suggestion of antipsychotic activity.	2.4310854883650492
	Subsequent research revealed that chlorpromazine's antipsychotic properties were due to its antagonism (blocking) of dopamine receptors in the brain.	2.401761372128853
	Unlike in Zickendraht, the evidence here not only demonstrates the unpredictability of minor structural changes on a compound's antipsychotic properties, but also indicates that the prior art would not have provided the skilled artisan with a reason to make the necessary structural changes to the unsubstituted butoxy to yield aripiprazole.	2.382499820231463
	Thus, neither the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent nor the Nakagawa declaration supports the Defendants' position that one of ordinary skill would have selected the prior art unsubstituted butoxy compound as a lead compound for further antipsychotic research.	2.2308055541745495
	Compound 5, the second most potent derivative with an ED 50 of 2.1, has a 5-propoxy linker and an unsubstituted phenyl ring.	2.2192229521977547
	And, as we noted above, although other prior art including the SE ï¿½ï¿½945 application disclosed 2,3-dichloro substituted compounds, those references failed to tie that disclosure to any meaningful suggestion of antipsychotic activity.	2.1888313355516873
	Of the nine carbostyril test compounds for which the Nakagawa declaration supplied mouse jumping data, the unsubstituted butoxy was inferior to four other test compounds and thus "was only of middling potency".	2.1705835608232
	Claim 16 claims "a pharmaceutical composition for treating schizophrenia containing, as the active ingredient, a carbostyril compound ...," id.	2.106332124717953
	The Nakagawa declaration discloses three sets of test data comparing certain carbostyril derivatives.	2.074053958619573
	As the district court found, the Nakagawa declaration would, if anything, have taught one of ordinary skill to select a 5-linked propoxy carbostyril derivative as a lead compound.	2.052845399015767
	patent was not obvious based on prior art patent that disclosed unsubstituted butoxy compound and "laundry list" of potential central nervous system controlling effects from carbostyril;	2.0482384881917604
	For example, the court credited evidence demonstrating the high degree of unpredictability in antipsychotic drug discovery as of the priority date.	2.0477817919755945
	Rather, the court found that a structure like clozapine or risperidone-both of which are structurally dissimilar to aripiprazole-would have been an attractive lead compound.	1.9982100514979553
	In short, we perceive no clear error in the district court's finding that one of ordinary skill would not have been motivated to pursue a 2,3-dichloro substitution on the phenyl ring as would have been required to convert the unsubstituted butoxy to aripiprazole.	1.9924746446275237
	Even assuming that one would have selected OPC-4392 as a lead compound, the district court found that the Defendants failed to prove that the prior art would have directed one to make the various modifications necessary to convert OPC-4392 into aripiprazole.	1.9853497221927179
	They were the natural and obvious lead compounds whose structures one would have considered to modify to obtain improved antipsychotic compounds.	1.935742200979822
	Based on that teaching, together with other prior art of record that focuses only on the effects of OPC-4392 on schizophrenia's negative symptoms, a skilled artisan would have concluded that OPC-4392 did not treat positive symptoms.	1.9299164288279251
	Mitsukuni Murasaki, Phase 1 Study of a New Antipsychotic Drug, OPC-4392, 12 Progress Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 793, 802 (1988) ( "Murasaki 1988"); J.A. 10396-406, at 10405.	1.9278444343459846
	The second alleged lead compound considered by the district court is a carbostyril derivative with the chemical name	1.9133230719847973
	Aripiprazole has chlorine substituents at the 2 and 3 positions of its phenyl ring, whereas the unsubstituted butoxy has hydrogens at those positions-i.e., it is "unsubstituted".	1.8967166870882404
	Due to those side effects clozapine was withdrawn from clinical trials in the 1970s, prompting scientists to seek an atypical antipsychotic drug similar to clozapine with respect to efficacy but lacking its toxicity and side effects.	1.8914096292200937
	The ï¿½ï¿½416 patent discloses that "carbostyril derivatives having antihistaminic action and central nervous controlling action are useful as antihistaminic agents or central nervous controlling agents".	1.8888735803213468
	The final purported lead compound considered by the district court is OPC-4392.	1.8323537127235736
	As the district court correctly held, the prior art would not have provided a skilled artisan with a reason to make the necessary structural changes to the unsubstituted butoxy to yield aripiprazole.	1.8157828895870938
	Thus, the best compounds in this test were the propoxys, not the butoxy.	1.8149195305921062
	In its double patenting analysis, the court determined "that the prior art, including the Nakagawa Declaration, ... did not teach the person of ordinary skill in the art to pursue a 2,3-dichloro substitution on the phenyl ring to achieve antipsychotic activity".	1.7854528012429502
	Claim 13 of the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent claims the unsubstituted butoxy using its chemical name.	1.7392059240744744
	This clear teaching controls over the far more nebulous disclosure that the trillions of carbostyril compounds encompassed by the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent "have antihistaminic and central nervous controlling effects".	1.7378667403761274
	Claim 23, which was added during re-examination of the ï¿½ï¿½528 patent, claims a method of treating schizophrenia comprising administering a pharmaceutical composition containing aripiprazole as an active ingredient.	1.7291099592045507
	"ANDA") filings to the FDA for approval to engage in the commercial manufacture, use, or sale of generic aripiprazole products.	1.7280045251955611
	In contrast, a "carbostyril" moiety has only one hydrogen atom at the 3 and 4 positions and a resulting double bond between the carbon atoms.	1.6437713670396852
	The Defendants also assert that the district court erred by rejecting OPC-4392 as a lead compound.	1.6227112898031877
	The Nakagawa declaration provides mouse jumping test data for nine carbostyril derivative test compounds and two prior art reference compounds.	1.614788073299243
	Carbostyrils were thus not plausible lead compounds, except in retrospect, and the district court did not clearly err in concluding that they were not.	1.611736387592668
	On appeal, the Defendants rely in large part on the inventors' and Otsuka's own development efforts in an attempt to prove that aripiprazole would have been obvious.	1.589119953099196
	Another prior art reference, Murasaki 1988, taught that OPC-4392, even at a "very low dose," id. at *12, 2010 U.S. Dist.	1.5678116452207636
	We therefore agree with the district court that the Defendants failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that the skilled artisan would have known how to modify OPC4392 to increase antipsychotic activity.	1.5326270278209324
	Mitsukuni Murasaki, New Psycho-Neuro Agents, 16 Japanese J. Clinical Psychiatry 1515, 1517 (1987) ( "Murasaki 1987"); J.A. 5891-919, at 5907.	1.5214518885546233
	patent was not obvious based on prior art declaration that disclosed three sets of test data comparing carbostyril derivatives on mice;	1.4334549731261934
	Compound 44, the most potent derivative with an ED 50 of 0.53, has a 5-propoxy linker and an ethoxy substituent (-OCH2CH3) at the 2-position of its phenyl ring.	1.4260601229998584
	Because we agree with the district court that the prior art would not have provided one of ordinary skill with a reason or motivation to make aripiprazole from the unsubstituted butoxy compound, we need not examine Otsuka's evidence of secondary considerations of nonobviousness.	1.404146254865835
	As for the Defendants' purported lead compounds, the district court carefully considered each compound and correctly rejected the contention that a skilled artisan would have selected those compounds for further antipsychotic drug research efforts.	1.4026025782467237
	In its analysis, the court considered the known carbostyril derivatives, with particular emphasis on the three purported "lead compounds" asserted by the Defendants.	1.401760665192062
	That finding resulted in the development of other "typical" antipsychotics, which treat positive symptoms but not negative symptoms and have a number of problematic side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms ("EPS"), tardive dyskinesia, prolactin elevation (hyperprolactinemia), and sudden decrease in blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension).	1.4012527547682154
	As the court noted, the claims of the prior art ï¿½ï¿½416 patent explicitly disclose the unsubstituted butoxy as producing an antihistaminic effect.	1.3803026341024476
	Significantly, the four more potent test compounds were all propoxy-linked, including Compound 44, which, with an ED 50 of 0.53 milligrams per kilogram, "was by far the most potent of the compounds tested".	1.3249362051898912
	The unsubstituted butoxy is disclosed and claimed in Otsuka's earlier U.S. Patent 4,734,416 (the "ï¿½ï¿½416 patent"), which the parties agree is prior art to the ï¿½ï¿½528 patent.	1.298585644959065
	Aripiprazole's carbostyril ring is referred to as "3,4-dihydro" because it has two hydrogen atoms (not shown in the structure above) connected to the 3 and 4 positions, and thus has a single bond between these two carbon atoms.	1.2519731875617235
	A prior art article published in 1987 describes OPC-4392 as "a totally new compound that is an anti-psychotic drug being developed".	1.2201345602104554

	The unsubstituted butoxy is also disclosed in a declaration submitted during the prosecution of the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent by one of that patent's co-inventors, Dr. Kazuyuki Nakagawa (the "Nakagawa declaration").	1.2020926521386115
	Like the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent, the SE ï¿½ï¿½945 application teaches that its carbostyril derivatives "can be used as antihistamines or agents having a regulating action in the central nervous system," J.A. 6495, and discloses numerous examples of agents in the latter category:	1.1864170535959406

	Turning to the particulars of the district court's decision on nonstatutory double patenting, the Defendants contend that the court improperly treated claim 13 of the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent in isolation without considering prior art, such as the Nakagawa declaration, which would have taught a skilled artisan to substitute a phenyl ring with chlorine atoms at the 2- and 3-positions to make aripiprazole.	1.0385991146527123
	We now turn to the Defendants' contention that the district court erred by failing to hold the asserted claims of the ï¿½ï¿½528 patent invalid for nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting in view of the unsubstituted butoxy compound of claim 13 of the ï¿½ï¿½416 patent.	0.9753933487468976

	In the present case, in assessing whether aripiprazole would have been prima facie obvious in view of the prior art compounds asserted by the Defendants, the district court summarized the applicable law as requiring inquiry into	0.9534949867080453
	As an initial matter, Otsuka argues in a footnote to its brief that the Nakagawa declaration is not eligible as prior art because the Defendants failed to prove that a chemist seeking to develop a new antipsychotic drug would have consulted the unindexed file history of the prior art ï¿½ï¿½416 patent in the course of his or her research.	0.9489312144975189
	Furthermore, Murasaki 1987 taught that "the strength of the activating action [of OPC-4392] stood out," J.A. 5907, a property that Dr. Roth testified would have been a "red flag" indicating that the drug was likely to cause patients to act out on their delusions and hallucinations.	0.9425782910702075
	The Unsubstituted Butoxy Compound	0.9222545581120268
	The court thus concluded that the Defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that one of ordinary skill would have been motivated to combine the asserted prior art to make aripiprazole and would have had a reasonable expectation of success in doing so.	0.9006716651368261
	Although the article stated that OPC-4392 was "expected to have fewer side effects than conventional drugs of the same class," it also reported that subjects receiving a 5-milligram dose of OPC-4392 "experienced sleeplessness, stagger, weakness, fatigability, heavy headedness, lack of motivation and disturbed concentration, which were so severe that they were not able to perform daily routine work".	0.8933382464250317

	Despite extensive research, the cause, mechanism, and etiology of schizophrenia remain unknown.	0.837554044861093
	In evaluating the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art, the district court first considered the unsubstituted butoxy compound disclosed in the prior art ï¿½ï¿½416 patent and the Nakagawa declaration.	0.8349236781768764
	The court then turned to the issue of nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting.	0.8235100593260409
	Geneva, however, involved nonstatutory double patenting based on anticipation, not obviousness.	0.764529277617553

	The first two measure the compounds' antihistaminic activity.	0.6788038903685986
	The court in this case applied the correct test for nonstatutory obviousness-type double patenting:	0.6590122059804961
