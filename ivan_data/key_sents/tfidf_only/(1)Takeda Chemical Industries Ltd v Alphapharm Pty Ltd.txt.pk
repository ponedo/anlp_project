	to manufacture and sell a generic version of pioglitazone.	3.3551323347272537
	Pioglitazone is referred to as the 5-ethyl compound because the ethyl substituent is attached to the 5-position on the pyridyl ring.	3.2717316615290195
	Claim 2 of the ï¿½ï¿½777 patent covers the single compound pioglitazone.	2.8680705467173198
	The formula includes the 3-ethyl compound, 4-ethyl compound, 5-ethyl compound (pioglitazone), and 6-ethyl compound.	2.4276797974729707
	The active ingredient in ACTOS THE-R is the TZD compound pioglitazone, a compound claimed in the patent in suit.	2.2227225553079593
	compound b. The court's characterization of pioglitazone's unexpected results is not clearly erroneous.	1.959921332446974
	The problem is that only one of the three claims involved here-claim 2-is limited to pioglitazone.	1.937354919708945
	Pioglitazone was shown to be the only compound that exhibited no toxicity, although many of the other compounds were found to be more potent.	1.8905140566346
	Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes-affecting over 90% of diabetic individuals.	1.7546473174447825
	Those compounds did not include pioglitazone, but included compound b. Significantly, Sodha II identified three specific compounds that were deemed most favorable in terms of toxicity and activity.	1.649267370419362
	Consequently, Takeda rebutted any presumed expectation that compound b and pioglitazone would share similar properties.	1.5816650974483186
	Here, the court found that pioglitazone exhibited unexpectedly superior properties over the prior art compound b. Takeda, 417 F.Supp.2d at 385.	1.4744236733548615
	During the following months, Takeda performed additional toxicity studies on fifty compounds that had been already synthesized and researched by Takeda, including pioglitazone.	1.4378817178854308
	first, homologation, i.e., replacing the methyl group with an ethyl group, which would have resulted in a 6-ethyl compound; and second, "ring-walking," or moving the ethyl substituent to another position on the ring, the 5-position, thereby leading to the discovery of pioglitazone.	1.4326143169486438
	Thus, the court found that there was no reasonable expectation that pioglitazone would possess the desirable property of nontoxicity, particularly in light of the toxicity of	1.4280185915777879
	Pioglitazone differs from compound b in two respects, and one would have to both homologate the methyl group of compound b and move the resulting ethyl group to the 5-position on the pyridyl ring in order to obtain pioglitazone.	1.3567247188467315
	In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas fails to produce insulin, and individuals suffering from this type of diabetes must regularly receive insulin from an external source.	1.3207898282578445
	An antidiabetic composition which consists essentially of a compound of the formula:	1.3188351185139582
	That report contained results of preliminary toxicity studies that involved selected compounds, including pioglitazone and compound b. Compound b was shown to be "toxic to the liver, heart and erythrocytes, among other things," whereas pioglitazone was "comparatively potent" and "showed no statistically significant toxicity".	1.3054618624473933
	The Sodha II reference disclosed data relating to hypoglycemic activity and plasma triglyceride lowering activity for 101 TZD compounds.	1.2474836782269798
	Takeda's research revealed that TZDs acted as insulin sensitizers, i.e., compounds that ameliorate insulin resistance.	1.241105585510361
	entitled "Studies on Antidiabetic Agents. II. Synthesis of 5-[4-(1-Methylcyclohexylmethoxy)-benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (ADD-3878) and Its Derivatives" ("Sodha II").	1.1883596488908401
	As such, Wilder does not aid Alphapharm because, unlike the homolog and claimed compound in Wilder that shared similar properties, pioglitazone was shown to differ significantly from compound b, of which it was not a homolog, in terms of toxicity.	1.1281495104518982
	Moreover, Dr. Mosberg relied on the efficacy data of phenyl compounds in Sodha II, but the court found those data insufficient to show that the same effects would occur in pyridyl compounds.	1.1143389667853103
	In the 1990s, a class of drugs known as thiazolidinediones ("TZDs") was introduced on the market as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.	1.108841749837748
	Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art would have concluded that Sodha II taught away from pyridyl compounds because it associated adverse side effects with compound b.	1.0073755239552087
	This is also referred to as insulin resistance.	1.003632715698864
	That patent covers a subset of compounds originally included in the ï¿½ï¿½200 patent application, namely, TZD compounds "where the pyridyl or thiazolyl groups may be substituted".	0.9966502699860629
	In addition, Takeda's witness, Dr. Morton, testified that at the time Sodha II was published, it was known that obesity contributed to insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes.	0.9934768921186499

	I join the opinion of the court insofar as it upholds the district court judgment based on a determination that a claim to pioglitazone (the 5-ethyl compound) would be non-obvious over the prior art.	0.952633989182164
	(collectively "Takeda") first invented certain TZDs in the 1970s.	0.9457890437785481
	Moreover, Dr. Mosberg agreed with Takeda's expert, Dr. Danishefsky, that the biological activities of various substituents were "unpredictable" based on the disclosure of Sodha II.	0.9380685400305118
	That chemical structure, which has an ethyl substituent (C2 H5) pictorially drawn to the center of the pyridyl ring, indicates that the structure covers four possible compounds, viz., compounds with an ethyl substituent located at the four available positions on the pyridyl ring.	0.9295558875565448
	The court next considered an article that was published the following year in 1982 by T. Sodha et al.	0.9255654699114678
	As for ring-walking, the court found that there was no reasonable expectation in the art that changing the positions of a substituent on a pyridyl ring would result in beneficial changes.	0.9109467623803117
	For purposes of this appeal, the critical portion of the compound structure is the left moiety of the molecule, namely, the ethyl-substituted pyridyl	0.8613979925692876
	In response, Takeda sued Alphapharm, along with three other generic drug manufacturers who also sought FDA approval to market generic pioglitazone, alleging that the defendants have infringed or will infringe the ï¿½ï¿½777 patent.	0.8429233229181496
	Although the function of TZDs was not completely understood, TZDs appeared to lower blood glucose levels by binding to a molecule in the nucleus of the cell known as PPARgamma, which activates insulin receptors and stimulates the production of glucose transporters.	0.8412444926648401
	The court continued its analysis and found that even if Alphapharm succeeded in making a prima facie showing, Takeda would still prevail because any prima facie case of obviousness was rebutted by the unexpected results of pioglitazone's nontoxicity.	0.8344903362784334
	The court found that the three compounds that the Sodha II reference identified as "most favorable" and "valuable for the treatment of maturity-onset diabetes," not compound b, would have served as the best "starting point for further investigation" to a person of ordinary skill in the art.	0.7259659270259853
	The court found that the ï¿½ï¿½200 patent "discloses hundreds of millions of TZD compounds".4	0.6928232404714116
	Based on the test results of the numerous compounds disclosed in Sodha II, the court concluded that "homologation had no tendency to decrease unwanted side effects" and thus researchers would have been inclined "to focus research efforts elsewhere".	0.6907771718132905

	In addition, the court relied on Dr. Rosenberg's admission that a person of ordinary skill in the art would "look at a host of substituents, such as chlorides, halides and others, not just methyls" in modifying the pyridyl ring.	0.5903247823276659
	Takeda developed the drug ACTOS THE-R, which is used to control blood sugar in patients who suffer from Type 2 diabetes. ACTOS THE-R has enjoyed substantial commercial success since its launch in 1999.	0.5820694475680144
	Takeda contends that there was overwhelming evidence presented at trial to support the court's conclusion that no motivation existed in the prior art for one of ordinary skill in the art to select compound b as a lead compound, and even if there was, that the unexpected results of pioglitazone's improved toxicity would have rebutted any prima facie showing of obviousness.	0.5789362471346973
	In discussing Sodha II, Dr. Rosenberg admitted that there was nothing in the article that would recommend that a person of ordinary skill in the art choose compound b over other compounds in the article that had the same efficacy rating.	0.5685073700866096
	And even if the statement did so represent, it does not refer to any specific substituent at any specific position of TZD's left moiety as particularly promising.	0.5600359556737198
	Dr. Mosberg opined that the steps of homologation and ring-walking were "routine steps in the drug optimization process," but the court found that testimony unavailing in light of the contrary, more credible, testimony offered by Takeda's experts.	0.5485955029209905

	It is generally caused by inadequate levels of insulin-a hormone produced in the pancreas.	0.5178610023498595
	We do not see any error in the district court's determination that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have been prompted to modify compound b, using the steps of homologation and ring-walking, to synthesize the claimed compounds.	0.5127702033337871
	Moreover, another Alphapharm 30(b)(6) witness, Barry Spencer, testified at his deposition that in reviewing the prior art, one of ordinary skill in the art would have chosen three compounds in Sodha II as lead compounds for research, not solely compound b.	0.5023289093508643
	Upon selecting that compound for antidiabetic research, Alphapharm asserts that one of ordinary skill in the art would have made two obvious chemical changes:	0.4988257060428775
	Alphapharm also points to a statement Takeda made during the prosecution of the ï¿½ï¿½779 patent as evidence that there was a reasonable expectation that making changes to the pyridyl region of compound b would lead to "better toxicity than the prior art".	0.49659107696856913

	Although the prosecution history of the ï¿½ï¿½779 patent included the statement that characterized compound b as "especially important," the court found that any suggestion to select compound b was essentially negated by the disclosure of the Sodha II reference.	0.48379811403942946
	Alphapharm's obviousness contention rested entirely on a prior art TZD compound that is referenced in Table 1 of the ï¿½ï¿½777 patent as	0.4766822990305874
	Rather than identify predictable solutions for antidiabetic treatment, the prior art disclosed a broad selection of compounds any one of which could have been selected as a lead compound for further investigation.	0.4718778954299478
	Relying on KSR, Alphapharm argues that the claimed compounds would have been obvious because the prior art compound fell within "the objective reach of the claim," and the evidence demonstrated that using the techniques of homologation and ring-walking would have been "obvious to try".	0.46071598354394483
	Thus, the court determined that the prior art did not suggest to one of ordinary skill in the art that compound b would be the best candidate as the lead compound for antidiabetic research.	0.4487336720316904
	The results were presented in another report by Fujita entitled "Pharmacological and Toxicological Studies of Ciglitazone and Its Analogues".	0.4447406953169916
	By "lead compound," we understand Alphapharm to refer to a compound in the prior art that would be most promising to modify in order to improve upon its antidiabetic activity and obtain a compound with better activity.3	0.44426306358607043
	The court first concluded that there was no motivation in the prior art to select compound b as the lead compound for antidiabetic research, and that the prior art taught away from its use.	0.44365622372305363
	Based on the prior art as a whole, however, the court found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have selected compound b as a lead compound for antidiabetic treatment.	0.4409198285037485
	The court reasoned that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have chosen compound b, notwithstanding the statement in the ï¿½ï¿½779 patent prosecution history, "given the more exhaustive and reliable scientific analysis presented by Sodha II, which taught away from compound b, and the evidence from all of the TZD patents that Takeda filed contemporaneously with the ï¿½ï¿½779 patent showing that there were many promising, broad avenues for further research".	0.4278604977172857

	In contrast, the court found that one of ordinary skill in the art would have chosen one of the many compounds disclosed in Sodha II, of which there were over ninety, that "did not disclose the existence of toxicity or side effects, and to engage in research to increase the efficacy and confirm the absence of toxicity of those compounds, rather than to choose as a starting point a compound with identified adverse effects".	0.37024476618308605

	According to Alphapharm, the record established that compound b was the most effective antidiabetic compound in the prior art, and thus the court erred by failing to apply a presumption that one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to make the claimed compounds.	0.3522836170991103

	The court, however, found nothing in the ï¿½ï¿½200 patent, or in its file history, to suggest to one of ordinary skill in the art that those nine compounds, out of the hundreds of millions of compounds covered by the patent application, were the best performing compounds as antidiabetics, and hence targets for modification to seek improved properties.	0.29251125319542504
	The court considered a report entitled "Preliminary Studies on Toxicological Effects of Ciglitazone-Related Compounds in the Rats" that was presented in February 1984 by Dr. Takeshi Fujita, then-Chief Scientist of Takeda's Biology Research Lab and co-inventor of the ï¿½ï¿½777 patent.	0.2821664724986715
	(Fed.Cir.2007) (relying on lack of unexpected results in determining that species claim was obvious in view of prior art genus claim); In re Woodruff, 919 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed.Cir.1990) (when applicant claims a subset of a range disclosed in a prior art patent, the applicant must generally show that "the claimed range achieves unexpected results relative to the prior art range".). While the 5-ethyl compound (pioglitazone) is within the scope of the ï¿½ï¿½200 patent, there is clear evidence, as the majority correctly finds, of unexpected results regarding that compound, and therefore its validity is not in question on this ground. However, at oral argument the patentee admitted that the prior art ï¿½ï¿½200 patent also generically covers the 6-ethyl compound, which is within the scope of claims 1 and 5 of the ï¿½ï¿½777 patent, and admitted that there is no evidence of unexpected results for the 6-ethyl compound. Under such circumstances, I believe that the 6-ethyl is likely obvious, and consequently claims 1 and 5 are likely invalid for obviousness. However, the argument as to the overbreadth of claims 1 and 5 has been waived, because it was not raised in the opening brief. In any event, as a practical matter, the judgment finding that the appellants' filing of the ANDA for pioglitazone is an infringement and barring the making of pioglitazone is supported by the finding that claim 2 standing alone is not invalid and is infringed. All Citations 492 F.3d 1350, 83 U.S.P.Q.2d 1169 Footnotes Pyridine is a "six-membered carbon-containing ring with one carbon replaced by a nitrogen". Takeda, 417 F.Supp.2d at 351. We note that the Supreme Court in its KSR opinion referred to the issue as whether claimed subject matter "was" or "was not" obvious. Since 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 103 uses the language "would have been obvious," and the Supreme Court in KSR did consider the particular time at which obviousness is determined, we consider that the Court did not in KSR reject the standard statutory formulation of the inquiry whether the claimed subject matter "would have been obvious at the time the invention was made". 35 U.S.C. ï¿½ï¿½ 103. Hence, we will continue to use the statutory "would have been" language. The parties do not dispute that compound b was the closest prior art compound. Thus, the legal question is whether or not the claimed subject matter would have been obvious over that compound. We will, however, use Alphapharm's terminology of "lead compound" in this opinion, deciding the appeal as it has been argued. Three divisional applications derive from the ï¿½ï¿½200 patent. Those applications matured into U.S. Patent 4,340,605, U.S. Patent 4,438,141, and U.S. Patent No. 4,444,779 (the "ï¿½ï¿½779 Patent"). The ï¿½ï¿½  779 patent is of particular relevance in this appeal and is discussed below. Takeda, 417 F.Supp.2d at 378. The concurrence, while agreeing that the question of the "overbreadth" of claims 1 and 5 has been waived, states further that the 6-ethyl compound, which is within the scope of claims 1 and 5, has not been shown to possess unexpected results sufficient to overcome a prima facie case of obviousness, and hence claims 1 and 5 are likely invalid as obvious. Since waiver is sufficient to answer the point being raised, no further comment need be made concerning its substance.	0.2754015779907861

	First, Alphapharm asserts that the district court misapplied the law, particularly the law governing obviousness in the context of structurally similar chemical compounds.	0.0466473520708116
	The court properly concluded that Alphapharm did not make out a prima facie case of obviousness because Alphapharm failed to adduce evidence that compound b would have been selected as the lead compound and, even if that preliminary showing had been made, it failed to show that there existed a reason, based on what was known at the time of the invention, to perform the chemical modifications necessary to achieve the claimed compounds.	0.04610388176107674

	In my view, the breadth of the other two claims, claims 1 and 5 of U.S. Patent No. 4,867,777 ("ï¿½ï¿½777 patent")-which are also referenced in the judgment-renders them likely invalid. All of the compounds claimed in claims 1, 2 and 5 were included in generic claims in the prior art U.S. Patent No. 4,287,200 ("ï¿½ï¿½200 patent"). Unfortunately our law concerning when a species is patentable over a genus claimed in the prior art is less than clear. It is, of course, well established that a claim to a genus does not necessarily render invalid a later claim to a species within that genus. See Eli Lilly & Co. v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Wash., 334 F.3d 1264, 1270 (Fed.Cir.2003). In my view a species should be patentable over a genus claimed in the prior art only if unexpected results have been established. Our case law recognizes the vital importance of a finding of unexpected results, both in this context and in the closely related context where a prior art patent discloses a numerical range and the patentee seeks to claim a subset of that range. See Application of Petering, 49 C.C.P.A. 993, 301 F.2d 676, 683 (1962) (species found patentable when genus claimed in prior art because unexpected properties of the species were shown); see also Pfizer, Inc. v.
