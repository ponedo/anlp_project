	the macrolide is clarithromycin".	16.706211866735416
	The district court analyzed the interchangeability of clarithromycin and azithromycin, stating:	6.219134009018733
	Claim 4 and 14 of the '190 patent cover compositions that include azithromycin or clarithromycin.	6.21748693530633
	A group of twenty underwent both a single 250 mg clarithromycin protocol and a multiple 250 mg clarithromycin protocol.	5.100918628827874
	In 2000, Abbott introduced its ER clarithromycin formulation, Biaxin XL.	4.811655598487626
	As the original patent on clarithromycin expired on May 23, 2005, generic competitors entered the market for immediate release clarithromycin on May 24, 2005.	4.359330970208523
	The specification defines "taste perversion" as "the perception of a bitter metallic taste normally associated with the erythromycin derivatives, particularly, with clarithromycin". '718 patent, col. 3, ll.	4.190659951767104
	In 1997, Abbott filed for a patent claiming an extended release formulation of clarithromycin.	4.011636795203802
	The patent, inter alia, describes and claims compositions of clarithromycin in an alginate matrix.	3.9200586162345346
	Notably, this definition of erythromycin derivative includes clarithromycin but excludes azithromycin, a related macrolide antibiotic sold by Pfizer as the drug Zithromax.	3.904700048814511
	The record shows discussion of the non-linear pharmacokinetics1 exhibited by clarithromycin.	3.814324106272914
	Teva did not dispute that its generic ER formulation of clarithromycin infringed Abbott's '718 and '616 patent claims.	3.7473769156867283
	Dr. Banker also noted that clarithromycin exhibits an extensive "first-pass" metabolism to an active metabolite, whereas azithromycin does not.	3.72285329495971
	For example, the court appears to have been influenced by Abbott's expert, Dr. Banker, who pointed out that the half-life of azithromycin is longer than that of clarithromycin.	3.626782529735587
	Because the '190 patent explicitly discloses only clarithromycin controlled release compositions, yet claims azithromycin compositions, we conclude that Abbott has represented to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") that the differences between clarithromycin and azithromycin were such that azithromycin could be substituted into a controlled release clarithromycin composition by a person of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.	3.5795884311426835
	The GI side effects of clarithromycin were known to be dependent on the drug concentration in the blood.	3.5493824358433947
	In December 2002, Teva filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") seeking approval to market an extended release form of clarithromycin similar to Abbott's ER clarithromycin drug, Biaxin XL.	3.339725845029387
	In 1991, Abbott, the exclusive licensee of the '803 patent, introduced Biaxin, an immediate release dosage form of clarithromycin.	3.205059583675776
	The '190 patent also discloses particular pharmacokinetic parameters for its controlled release clarithromycin and alginate compositions.	3.169407357407074
	Not only does the '190 patent claim compositions with clarithromycin, but claim 14 of the '190 patent claims "the composition of claim 4, wherein the macrolide is selected from the group consisting of erythromycin, dirithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin, and ABT-229".	3.0798724291510218
	Despite these claims to varied compositions, the specification only explicitly describes compositions made from clarithromycin.	3.0134961565364358
	The article describes a study of single and multiple dose trials of clarithromycin and it reported the side effects encountered by participants including taste perversion.	2.9557689814087302
	At the district court, Teva argued that well before the invention of the patent, adverse gastrointestinal effects were widely known as side effects of both erythromycin and clarithromycin and, to a lesser degree, azithromycin.	2.858172325200359
	As support, Teva cited a 1993 article written by Abbott researchers, discussing the pharmacokinetics of single- and multiple-dose clarithromycin".	2.6956179252700347
	Patentee brought action alleging infringement of its patents relating to extended release formulations of clarithromycin.	2.674428637036304
	Teva's prior art references reveal that using HPMC was a logical line of inquiry but the dissimilarities between the drugs with which HPMC had been successfully combined and clarithromycin defeat	2.660220886393106
	Teva's prior art references reveal that using HPMC was a logical line of inquiry but the dissimilarities between the drugs with which HPMC had been successfully combined and clarithromycin defeat	2.660220886393106
	Teva's prior art references reveal that using HPMC was a logical line of inquiry but the dissimilarities between the drugs with which HPMC had been successfully combined and clarithromycin defeat	2.660220886393106
	At the district court, Teva argued that "it was known that clarithromycin caused taste perversion and this created a motivation for formulators to try to create an extended release formulation that would have an improved taste profile.	2.6600862156110825
	On appeal, Teva argues that, based on the '422 publication, a person of ordinary skill in the art would replace the alginate of the '190 patent with HPMC because the '422 publication disclosed using HPMC with azithromycin, a compound related to clarithromycin.	2.657605115876199
	Thus, the '190 patent discloses an extended release formulation of clarithromycin wherein the polymer used is alginate as opposed to the polymers like HPMC claimed in the '718 patent.	2.5583978698914933
	In its brief on appeal, Abbott contends that "the inventions of the patents in suit decrease the incidence and severity of two primary side effects of clarithromycin: taste perversion and gastrointestinal distress....	2.550078098123419
	Clarithromycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic from the macrolide family of antibiotics, all of which are derived from erythromycin A. Taisho Pharmaceuticals Ltd. received U.S. Patent No. 4,331,803 (" '803 patent") for clarithromycin in 1982.	2.520520213677023
	Abbott argued that only its own study by its researchers mentioned taste perversion.	2.492154920831566
	Lastly, Abbott states that "taste perversion is different from simply an 'unpleasant taste' of the drug when first ingested....	2.4480212439049125
	The district court agreed with Abbott and found that because of the chemical and metabolic differences between azithromycin and clarithromycin, "a person of ordinary skill in the art would not have had a reasonable expectation that the azithromycin formulation in the '422 publication ... would lead to the features claimed in the '718 patent".	2.4095012790859647
	As to Abbott's likelihood of success on the merits, "Teva does not dispute that its generic clarithromycin extended release formulation infringes Abbott's '718 and '616 patents.	2.3968463473801096
	Teva relies primarily on only one study, cited apparently in only one article, that mentions taste perversion as a known side effect of clarithromycin, and even then, in only one of thirty-eight research subjects.	2.3742418452320226
	Teva relies primarily on only one study, cited apparently in only one article, that mentions taste perversion as a known side effect of clarithromycin, and even then, in only one of thirty-eight research subjects".	2.3742418452320226
	As Dr. Lee noted, because the drug is transformed into an active metabolite, "a person skilled in the art would have expected that clarithromycin would work even better than azithromycin in an extended release formulation".	2.324427343033628
	Thus, Teva makes substantial arguments that the '190 patent discloses a clarithromycin composition with alginate (as opposed to a polymer like HPMC) that arguably has the pharmacokinetic parameters required in claim 4 of the '718 patent.	2.255004306255476
	Based on this usage in the specification, the district court concluded that "taste perversion" and "taste profile" are "used synonymously".	2.206410482267749
	It pertained to controlled-release dosage forms of azithromycin with HPMC that, among other things, was meant to address the GI side effects of azithromycin.	2.163174940940555
	Instead, the panel majority explains that its finding of likelihood of success in proving obviousness is supported "not by what the '190 patent discloses but what it does not disclose" (emphasis in maj. op.), proposing that: "Abbott has represented to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that the differences between clarithromycin and azithromycin were such that azithromycin could be substituted into a controlled release clarithromycin composition by a person of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation".	2.156096849144491
	Thus, Abbott's own statements from its brief support the argument that reduction of taste perversion would not be unexpected when an extended release formulation lowers the concentration of the drug in the blood.8 Based, on these references and statements, a substantial question exists that the improvement of the taste perversion side-effect would not be unexpected in an extended release formulation of clarithromycin.	2.1532080654554755
	Teva also pointed to Abbott's own U.S. Patent No. 5,705,190 (" '190 patent") which disclosed a controlled release pharmaceutical formulation of clarithromycin combined with a water soluble alginate salt.	2.144643392878422
	Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") brought suit against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ("Teva") alleging infringement of its patents relating to extended release formulations of clarithromycin.	2.140944913309914
	First, as to the GI side-effects, the district court found that the "GI side effects of clarithromycin were known to be dependent on the drug concentration in the blood".	2.0937064326752397
	Thus, out of the four trials, neither of 250 mg protocols produced taste perversion as a side-effect while each 500 mg trial produced one reported case of taste perversion.	2.0513022077562564
	The '190 patent itself demonstrates that Abbott has represented to the PTO and the public in general that a person of ordinary skill in the art can expect to successfully substitute azithromycin into a clarithromycin controlled release composition without undue experimentation.	2.026375870734962
	Abbott argues that such a motivation is lacking here because the compounds azithromycin and clarithromycin are so different that the '422 publication would not reasonably motivate a person of skill in the art to interchange the components of the formulations in the '422 publication with those of the '190 patent with a reasonable expectation of success.	2.005996676108355
	AUC/ï¿½n where ï¿½n>>	1.9333439235265442

	ï¿½n < CMaxIR-CMinIR/AUCIR / ï¿½n	1.9234380508993412
	The other references, like the '422 publication, either describe other non-taste related side effects or they describe "taste masking" rather than "taste perversion".	1.9101917162276711
	Furthermore, as to its one study, Abbott argued that the mere fact that taste perversion is mentioned does not make claim 6 obvious and, additionally, that Teva had not even shown evidence that taste perversion is dose dependent.	1.8970083752437408
	The panel majority acknowledges the law, but finds a motivation to make the claimed formulation by combining the information in Abbott's prior art Patent No. 5,705,190, which shows extended release formulations of clarithromycin and azithromycin in "alginate," a known release agent derived from seaweed, with a Pfizer publication designated WO 95/30422, which shows the HPMC (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose) of the '718 patent used with azithromycin.	1.8630720350988468
	From among these protocols, one participant in each of the 500 mg protocols reported taste perversion.	1.857286939140301
	= CMaxER-CMinER/AUCER /	1.8559703165889239
	Claim 2 of the '616 patent sets forth a method of reducing gastrointestinal adverse side effects comprising administering an effective amount of an extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer, wherein the erythromycin derivative is clarithromycin. '616 patent, col. 12, ll.	1.8386646153849802
	This court finds that Teva has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that improved taste profile as a result of an extended release formulation of clarithromycin would have been obvious to an ordinary person skilled in the art.	1.8346808611505803
	Therefore, Abbott is incorrect in stating that the study only reported taste perversion at one of four dosage levels.	1.8175417793608772
	First, the extended release composition includes an erythromycin derivative.	1.7966424061429165
	In particular, the application disclosed controlled release formulations created from combining azithromycin with HPMC.	1.7887637321454568
	From among these two 250 mg protocols, no participants reported taste perversion as a side-effect.	1.7793145175147174
	CMax_ER< CMax_IR, AUCER = AUCIR, and	1.7714844660303677
	Specifically, would a person of ordinary skill in the art have had a reasonable expectation of success in creating an extended release formulation of clarithromycin using a hydrophilic water-soluble polymer based on the prior art, including the '422 patent for an extended release formulation of azithromycin with such a polymer?	1.7322628864912668
	They require an erythromycin derivative, a polymer, and they each recite improvement of a side effect (taste perversion for claim 6 of the '718 patent and GI side effects for claim 2 of the '616 patent).	1.7200834306083894
	Second, as to taste perversion, Teva points to a number of prior art references including a study conducted by Abbott described in S.-y.	1.5679360962045605
	= CMaxIR-CMinIR/CAvIR = DFLIR	1.5186312837339009
	As of May 2005, Abbott estimated that, as between Biaxin and Biaxin XL, Biaxin XL accounted for 70% of sales in the Biaxin market.	1.4807598622237277
	From these statements, Abbot suggests that systemic side effects like taste perversion correlate with overall drug blood levels.	1.4426509471059006
	Furthermore, for claim 2 of the '616 patent, reducing gastrointestinal side effects is given its plain meaning while for claim 6 of the '718 patent, "taste profile" is read as synonymous with "taste perversion".	1.4344642874905507
	As to claim 6, the district court specifically construed the term "taste profile" noting that the specification of the '718 patent describes "taste profile" in parentheses immediately following the words "taste perversion". '718 patent, col. 9, ll.	1.434020261677176
	Only one of thirty eight subjects reported taste perversion as a side effect, and only at one of four different dosage levels".	1.4298971275378878
	Abbott points out that the status quo ante will not easily be recoverable if interim infringement is authorized; Abbott also points out that there is no patent barrier to Teva's entry into commerce with its own extended release formulation instead of that of Abbott, for the basic patent on clarithromycin has expired.	1.4095846252227406
	This is not a characteristic of azithromycin, the product whose formulation is relied on by the panel majority, as discussed infra.	1.4001233631865264
	On the other hand, we also note that the district court found that "the parties' models of how the market will react to generic competition for extended release clarithromycin remain highly speculative" and Teva has not proven that monetary damages will suffice.	1.3553791670409296
	Addressing the drugs' differences in half-life and metabolism, Dr. Lee concluded that "these characteristics further support the expectation that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have motivation and a reasonable expectation of success in making a successful ER formulation of clarithromycin ...." (emphasis added).	1.330742557787906
	Rather, it refers 'to the continuing effect of the drug upon the sense of taste while the drug remains in the bloodstream ....' " In other words, taste perversion is not related to a direct, local taste sensation from the drug on the tongue but is rather a systemic side effect.	1.2814525895260769
¡°	The patent describes and claims extended release ("ER") formulations comprising erythromycin derivatives combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer.	1.2396906630539857
	For example, the '422 publication filed by Pfizer Inc., discloses controlled-release dosage forms of azithromycin.	1.2210299734775543
	CMaxER-CMinER/CAvER	1.1814938278810774
	Admittedly, finding 0 out of 20 cases in neither 250 mg dosage protocols and 1 out of 18 cases in each 500 mg protocol does not establish that taste perversion is dose dependent but it does support such arguments.	1.1364004402479093
	Third, the claim includes specific pharmacokinetic parameters that the erythromycin derivative and polymer composition must meet.	1.127702252105566
	Moreover, the '422 [publication] for extended release azithromycin disclosed that extended release compositions of that closely-related compound reduced gastrointestinal side effects.	1.090291648585549
	Claim 2 requires that the composition [1] induces statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index in the plasma than an immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative while [2] maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative.	1.0840075024038294
	Claim 2 of the '718 patent claims3 a pharmaceutical composition for extended release of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal environment, comprising an erythromycin derivative and from about 5 to about 50% by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer, wherein the polymer is a hydrophilic water-soluble polymer, so that when ingested orally, the composition induces statistically significantly lower mean fluctuation index in the plasma than an immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative while maintaining bioavailability substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release composition of the erythromycin derivative. '718 patent, col. 11, ll.	1.0797806584184746
	CMin_ER =	1.0129252807683642
	Claim 6 of the '718 patent claims an extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising an erythromycin derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer, the composition having an improved taste profile as compared to the immediate release formulation. '718 patent, col. 12, ll.	0.9443429440623382
	Furthermore, the specification describes the " 'more preferable' " polymer as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose ("HPMC").	0.9415115893301704
	Thus, sufficient conditions for satisfying claim 2's pharmacokinetic parameters are that: DFLER < DFLIR and AUCER = AUCIR.	0.9348364966620342
	We agree with the district court's preliminary claim construction as to "erythromycin derivative" and "pharmaceutically acceptable polymer" in both claims 2 and 4.	0.9097948030530473
	The specification defines the "maximum plasma concentration of the erythromycin derivative, produced by the ingestion of the composition of the invention or the IR comparator" as CMax. '718 patent, col. 3, ll.	0.90624773096177
	As can be seen, claim 4 also has three basic elements: the erythromycin derivative, the polymer, and specific (but different from claim 2) pharmacokinetic parameters.	0.8974423973105805
	This court finds that the prior art, specifically the discussions in industry treatises and medical journals of formulations that reduced GI irritation, the teachings of the '422 [publication], and the reference material in the Physicians' Desk Reference regarding side effects, would lead a person of ordinary skill in the art to expect that an extended release formulation of clarithromycin would reduce adverse GI side effects.	0.8927592141722678
	For these claims, "erythromycin derivative" and "pharmaceutically acceptable polymer" are construed as they are construed in claims 2 and 4 of the '718 patent discussed above.	0.8918059922293041
	Similarly, claim 4 claims a pharmaceutical composition for extended release of an erythromycin derivative in the gastrointestinal environment, comprising an erythromycin derivative and from about 5 to about 50% by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer, so that upon oral ingestion, maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate release pharmaceutical composition, and area under the concentration-time curve and the minimum plasma concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition. '718 patent, col. 11, ll.	0.8779564996913316
	The '190 patent only discloses the use of alginate in making controlled release formulations.	0.7761398789750962
	Following the discussion above of claim 2 and 4 of the '718 patent, there are substantial arguments that an extended release formulation with an erythromycin derivative and an acceptable polymer would have been obvious in light of the prior art.7	0.7649706742665782
	The claims are directed to an extended-release formulation of erythromycin in a polymer matrix, and require that the minimum plasma concentration for the extended release formulation is substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release formulation; that is, the drug is released so as to be present in the plasma at the same minimum level for both the immediate release and extended release formulations, and with less fluctuation for the extended release product.	0.7044938520521437
	From these definitions given in the specification, we can describe the three pharmacokinetic limitations of claim 4 as CMax_ER< CMax_IR, AUCER = AUCIR, and CMin_ER =	0.6771874031787417
	Claim 2 addresses reducing adverse GI side effects while claim 6 addresses improving the taste profile.	0.6706922168397765
	Even though claim 2 is a method claim and claim 6 is a composition, they both deal with ER compositions of erythromycin derivatives combined with pharmaceutically acceptable polymers that can improve adverse side effects compared to the IR compositions.	0.6696079007951471
	Further, based on the '718 patent application, Abbott filed a continuation-in-part application that claims a method of reducing adverse gastrointestinal ("GI") side effects of erythromycin-derived drug formulations by using extended release formulations.	0.6534015048443854
	From the specification, the district court defined erythromycin derivative in both claims as meaning " 'erythromycin having no substituent groups, or having conventional substituent groups, in organic synthesis, in place of a hydrogen atom of the hydroxy groups and/or a methyl group of the 3'-dimethylamino group, which is prepared according to the conventional manner.' " Abbott Labs., slip op.	0.6476672311885459
	The specification defines the "degree of fluctuation" or DFL as DFL = (CMax-CMin )/CAv, '718 patent, col. 3, l. 33.	0.636200591320842
	Other prior art, though, does disclose extended release formulations with pharmaceutically acceptable polymers like HPMC.	0.5928543097919294
	Claim 4 of the '190 patent claims "a controlled release, solid pharmaceutical composition ... comprising: a therapeutically effective amount of a macrolide ... [and] a water-soluble alginate salt ...."	0.5873035791396681
	In claim 4 the pharmacokinetic limitations require that upon oral ingestion, maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate release pharmaceutical composition, and area under the concentration-time curve and the minimum plasma concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition.	0.5646691164841682

	In short, the parameters of claim 4 require three things: [1] maximum peak concentrations of the erythromycin derivative are lower than those produced by an immediate release pharmaceutical composition, [2] area under the concentration-time curve are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition and, [3] the minimum plasma concentration are substantially equivalent to that of the immediate release pharmaceutical composition. '718 patent, col. 11, ll.	0.4399531107113888
	And as to Abbott's economic arguments, we do not doubt that generic competition will impact Abbott's sales of Biaxin XL, but that alone does not establish that Abbott's harm will be irreparable.	0.4377940354030724
	See Shargel & Yu, Applied Biopharmaceutics and Pharmacokinetics	0.4293951431436539
	Furthermore, Teva also relied on Pfizer's '422 publication which, as discussed above, disclosed extended release formulations for amelioration of other macrolide related side effects.	0.4282632193707457
	Single- and Multiple-dose Pharmacokinetics of Clarithromycin, a New Macrolide Antimicrobial, 33 J. Clin.	0.4275601581767274
	As a result, based on Abbott's own '190 patent, there exists a substantial argument that a person of ordinary skill in the art would be motivated to combine the '422 publication, namely the use of HPMC in extended release macrolide compositions, with the '190 patent with a reasonable expectation of success.	0.4084854214840264
	Based on this logarithm-based definition, it follows that, at a minimum, where AUCER = AUCIR then the two compositions would have substantially equivalent bioavailability.	0.4038545393603752
	By subtracting claim 4's third condition from the first, one can infer that the composition from the '190 patent also satisfies CMaxER-CMinER < CMaxIR-CMinIR .	0.3956816200271648
	For example, as pointed out by Teva, a side-by-side comparison of Formula C of the '190 patent with an IR formulation shows that Formula C exhibited a lower CMax (2.00 ï¿½gg/mL) than the immediate release formulation (2.28 ï¿½gg/mL) and substantially equivalent AUC (28.69 ranging from 24.61 to 32.74 ï¿½gg h/mL vs. 32.16 ranging from 25.66 to 42.70 ï¿½ggh/mL ) and substantially equivalent	0.39493502490320953
	By comparing the disclosed pharmacokinetic parameters from the '190 patent, a substantial argument exists that the '190 patent also discloses compositions satisfying DFLER < DFLIR.	0.39491415778736205
	The ER formulation enabled patients to take one pill per day rather than twice, as had been required with the immediate release ("IR") formulation.	0.38546178530262315
	In other words, because the '190 patent disclosed a composition satisfying the pharmacokinetic limitations of claim 4, the '190 patent also disclosed compositions that satisfy DFLER < DFLIR and are substantially bioequivalent.5	0.3747058785206379
	This inequality, with the definition of the fluctuation index, and with the second limitation from claim 4, establishes that:	0.36795019602090395
	The resulting drug-polymer matrix leads to the extended release properties of the formulation.	0.3672188209811662
	The court concluded that they were not so similar as to be interchangeable in the context of polymers like HPMC, correctly rejecting the argument that "obvious to try" can establish obviousness.	0.35682379007337045
	At the same time, the minimum plasma concentration for the extended release formulation will be substantially the same as that of the immediate release formulation, meaning that the drug will be present in the blood at the same minimum level at all times for both the immediate release and extended release formulations.	0.3562797859777003

	As mentioned above, though the inequality follows strictly from satisfying the conditions of claim 4, this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the fluctuation index of the extended release formulation is "statistically significantly lower" than the immediate release.	0.30520096833977045
	As opposed to claim 2 and 4 of the '718 patent, claim 6 of the '718 and claim 2 of the '616 do not limit their claimed extended release formulations with any specific pharmacokinetic parameters.	0.2932177807916763

	The district court elaborated on this language by stating that this means that the concentration-time curve representing the concentration of drug in blood plasma will be flatter and lower for the extended release formulation than for the immediate release formulation, but will have an area under the curve ("AUC") that is substantially equivalent to that of its immediate release corollary.	0.2827907591449825
