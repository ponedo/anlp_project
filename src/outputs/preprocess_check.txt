Opinion CLEVENGER , Circuit_Judge .
__NEW_SENT__
This is a patent infringement suit brought by Amazon.com , Inc. ( `` Amazon '' ) against barnesandnoble.com , inc. , and barnesandnoble.com llc ( together , `` BN '' ) .
__NEW_SENT__
Amazon moved for a preliminary_injunction to prohibit BN 's use of a feature of its web_site called `` Express Lane . ''
__NEW_SENT__
BN resisted *1347 the preliminary_injunction on several grounds , including that its Express Lane feature did not infringe the claims of Amazon 's patent , and that substantial questions exist as to the validity of Amazon 's patent .
__NEW_SENT__
The United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Washington rejected BN 's contentions .
__NEW_SENT__
Instead , the district_court held that Amazon had presented a case showing a likelihood of infringement by BN , and that BN 's challenges to the validity of the patent in suit lacked sufficient merit to avoid awarding extraordinary preliminary injunctive relief to Amazon .
__NEW_SENT__
The district_court granted Amazon 's motion , and now BN brings its timely appeal from the order entering the preliminary_injunction .
__NEW_SENT__
We have jurisdiction to review the district_court 's order under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 ) .
__NEW_SENT__

__NEW_PARA__
After careful review of the district_court 's opinion , the record , and the arguments advanced by the parties , we conclude that BN has mounted a substantial challenge to the validity of the patent in suit .
__NEW_SENT__
Because Amazon is not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief under these circumstances , we vacate the order of the district_court that set the preliminary_injunction in place and remand the case for further proceedings.\n \n\n\nI This case involves United States Patent BIG_TOKEN__No._5__BIG_TOKEN ,960,411 ( `` the BIG_TOKEN__¡¬411_patent__BIG_TOKEN `` ) , which issued on September 28 , 1999 , and is assigned to Amazon .
__NEW_SENT__
On October 21 , 1999 , Amazon brought suit against BN alleging infringement of the patent and seeking a preliminary_injunction .
__NEW_SENT__

__NEW_PARA__
Amazon 's patent is directed to a method and system for `` single_action '' ordering of items in a client/server_environment such as the Internet .
__NEW_SENT__
In the context of the BIG_TOKEN__¡¬411_patent__BIG_TOKEN , a client/server_environment describes the relationship between two computer systems in which a program executing on a client_computer_system makes a service request from another program executing on a server_computer_system , which fulfills the request .
__NEW_SENT__
See BIG_TOKEN__col._1 , _ll._10-31__BIG_TOKEN ; BIG_TOKEN__col._3 , _ll._31-33__BIG_TOKEN ; BIG_TOKEN__col._5 , _l._56__BIG_TOKEN to BIG_TOKEN__col._6 , _l._21__BIG_TOKEN ; BIG_TOKEN__Fig._2__BIG_TOKEN .
__NEW_SENT__
Typically , the client_computer_system and the server_computer_system are located remotely from each other and communicate via a data communication network .
__NEW_SENT__

__NEW_PARA__
The BIG_TOKEN__¡¬411_patent__BIG_TOKEN describes a method and system in which a consumer can complete a purchase_order for an item via an electronic network using only a `` single_action , '' such as the click of a computer mouse button on the client_computer_system .
__NEW_SENT__
Amazon developed the patent to cope with what it considered to be frustrations presented by what is known as the `` shopping_cart_model '' purchase system for electronic commerce purchasing events .
__NEW_SENT__
In previous incarnations of the shopping_cart_model , a purchaser using a client_computer_system ( such as a personal computer executing a web browser program ) could select an item from an electronic catalog , typically by clicking on an `` Add to Shopping Cart '' icon , thereby placing the item in the `` virtual '' shopping_cart .
__NEW_SENT__
Other items from the catalog could be added to the shopping_cart in the same manner .
__NEW_SENT__
When the shopper completed the selecting process , the electronic commercial event would move to the check-out counter , so to speak .
__NEW_SENT__
Then , information regarding the purchaser 's identity , billing and shipping addresses , and credit payment method would be inserted into the transactional information base by the soon-to-be purchaser .
__NEW_SENT__
Finally , the purchaser would `` click '' on a button displayed on the screen or somehow issue a command to execute the completed order , and the server_computer_system would verify and store the information concerning the transaction .
__NEW_SENT__

__NEW_PARA__
As is evident from the foregoing , an electronic commerce purchaser using the shopping_cart_model is required to perform *1348 several actions before achieving the ultimate goal of the placed_order .
__NEW_SENT__
The BIG_TOKEN__¡¬411_patent__BIG_TOKEN sought to reduce the number of actions required from a consumer to effect a placed_order .
__NEW_SENT__
In the words of the written description of the BIG_TOKEN__¡¬411_patent__BIG_TOKEN : The present_invention provides a method and system for single-action ordering of items in a client/server_environment .
__NEW_SENT__
The single-action ordering system of the present_invention reduces the number of purchaser_interactions needed to place an order and reduces the amount of sensitive information that is transmitted between a client system and a server system .
__NEW_SENT__
BIG_TOKEN__Col._3 , _ll._31-37__BIG_TOKEN .
__NEW_SENT__
How , one may ask , is the number of purchaser_interactions reduced ?
__NEW_SENT__
The answer is that the number of purchaser_interactions is reduced because the purchaser has previously visited the seller 's web_site and has previously entered into the database of the seller all of the required billing and shipping information that is needed to effect a sales transaction .
__NEW_SENT__
Thereafter , when the purchaser visits the seller 's web_site and wishes to purchase a product from that site , the patent specifies that only a single_action is necessary to place the order for the item .
__NEW_SENT__
In the words of the written description , `` once the description of an item is displayed , the purchaser need only take a single_action to place the order to purchase that item . ''
