Opinion
CLEVENGER Circuit_Judge
This is a patent infringement suit brought by Amazon.com Inc. ( `` Amazon '' ) against barnesandnoble.com inc. and barnesandnoble.com llc ( together `` BN '' )
Amazon moved for a preliminary_injunction to prohibit BN 's use of a feature of its web_site called `` Express Lane ''
BN resisted *1347 the preliminary_injunction on several grounds including that its Express Lane feature did not infringe the claims of Amazon 's patent and that substantial questions exist as to the validity of Amazon 's patent
The United_States_District_Court for the Western_District of Washington rejected BN 's contentions
Instead the district_court held that Amazon had presented a case showing a likelihood of infringement by BN and that BN 's challenges to the validity of the patent in suit lacked sufficient merit to avoid awarding extraordinary preliminary injunctive relief to Amazon
The district_court granted Amazon 's motion and now BN brings its timely appeal from the order entering the preliminary_injunction
We have jurisdiction to review the district_court 's order under 28 U.S.C.¡± 1292 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( 1994 )
After careful review of the district_court 's opinion the record and the arguments advanced by the parties we conclude that BN has mounted a substantial challenge to the validity of the patent in suit
Because Amazon is not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief under these circumstances we vacate the order of the district_court that set the preliminary_injunction in place and remand the case for further proceedings
I
This case involves United States Patent No._5960,411 ( `` the ¡¬411_patent `` ) which issued on September 28 1999 and is assigned to Amazon
On October 21 1999 Amazon brought suit against BN alleging infringement of the patent and seeking a preliminary_injunction
Amazon 's patent is directed to a method and system for `` single_action '' ordering of items in a client/server_environment such as the Internet
In the context of the ¡¬411_patent a client/server_environment describes the relationship between two computer systems in which a program executing on a client_computer_system makes a service request from another program executing on a server_computer_system which fulfills the request
See col._1,_ll._10-31 ; col._3,_ll._31-33 ; col._5,_l._56 to col._6,_l._21 ; Fig._2
Typically the client_computer_system and the server_computer_system are located remotely from each other and communicate via a data communication network
The ¡¬411_patent describes a method and system in which a consumer can complete a purchase_order for an item via an electronic network using only a `` single_action '' such as the click of a computer mouse button on the client_computer_system
Amazon developed the patent to cope with what it considered to be frustrations presented by what is known as the `` shopping_cart_model '' purchase system for electronic commerce purchasing events
In previous incarnations of the shopping_cart_model a purchaser using a client_computer_system ( such as a personal computer executing a web browser program ) could select an item from an electronic catalog typically by clicking on an `` Add to Shopping Cart '' icon thereby placing the item in the `` virtual '' shopping_cart
Other items from the catalog could be added to the shopping_cart in the same manner
When the shopper completed the selecting process the electronic commercial event would move to the check-out counter so to speak
Then information regarding the purchaser 's identity billing and shipping addresses and credit payment method would be inserted into the transactional information base by the soon-to-be purchaser
Finally the purchaser would `` click '' on a button displayed on the screen or somehow issue a command to execute the completed order and the server_computer_system would verify and store the information concerning the transaction
As is evident from the foregoing an electronic commerce purchaser using the shopping_cart_model is required to perform *1348 several actions before achieving the ultimate goal of the placed_order
The ¡¬411_patent sought to reduce the number of actions required from a consumer to effect a placed_order
In the words of the written description of the ¡¬411_patent : The present_invention provides a method and system for single-action ordering of items in a client/server_environment
The single-action ordering system of the present_invention reduces the number of purchaser_interactions needed to place an order and reduces the amount of sensitive information that is transmitted between a client system and a server system
Col._3,_ll._31-37
How one may ask is the number of purchaser_interactions reduced ?
The answer is that the number of purchaser_interactions is reduced because the purchaser has previously visited the seller 's web_site and has previously entered into the database of the seller all of the required billing and shipping information that is needed to effect a sales transaction
Thereafter when the purchaser visits the seller 's web_site and wishes to purchase a product from that site the patent specifies that only a single_action is necessary to place the order for the item
In the words of the written description `` once the description of an item is displayed the purchaser need only take a single_action to place the order to purchase that item ''
